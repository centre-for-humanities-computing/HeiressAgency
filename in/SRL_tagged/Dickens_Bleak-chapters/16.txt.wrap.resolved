Deportment Richard left us on the very next evening to begin Deportment Richard new career, and committed Ada to my charge with great love for Ada and great trust in Deportment Richard. It touched me then to reflect, and It touches me now, more nearly, to remember (having what I have to tell) how they both thought of Deportment Richard, even at that engrossing time. I was a part of all their plans, for the present and the future. I was to write Deportment Richard once a week, making my faithful report of Ada, who was to write to Deportment Richard every alternate day. I was to be informed, under Deportment Richard own hand, of all Deportment Richard labours and successes; I was to observe how resolute and persevering Deportment Richard would be; I was to be Ada's bridesmaid when all his labours and successes were married; I was to live with all his labours and successes afterwards; I was to keep all the keys of all his labours and successes house; I was to be made happy for ever and a day. "And if the suit SHOULD make us rich, Esther--which it may, you know!" said Deportment Richard to crown all. A shade crossed Ada's face. "My dearest Ada," asked Deportment Richard, "why not?" "It had better declare us poor at once," said My dearest Ada. "Oh! I don't know about that," returned Deportment Richard, "but at all events, It won't declare anything at once. It hasn't declared anything in heaven knows how many years." "Too true," said My dearest Ada. "Yes, but," urged Deportment Richard, answering what My dearest Ada look suggested rather than My dearest Ada words, "the longer "the goes on, dear cousin, the nearer it must be to a settlement one way or other. Now, is not that reasonable?" "You know best, Deportment Richard. But I am afraid if we trust to it, it will make we unhappy." "But, My dearest Ada, we are not going to trust to it!" cried Deportment Richard gaily. "we know it better than to trust to it. we only say that if it SHOULD make we rich, we have no constitutional objection to being rich. The court is, by solemn settlement of law, we grim old guardian, and we are to suppose that what it gives we (when it gives we anything) is we right. It is not necessary to quarrel with our right." "No," Said Ada, "but it may be better to forget all about it." "Well, well," cried Deportment Richard, "then we will forget all about it! we consign the whole thing to oblivion. Dame Durden puts on Dame Durden approving face, and it's done!" "Dame Durden approving face," said I, looking out of the box in which I was packing "Dame Durden's approving face books, "was not very visible when you called his books by that name; but his books does approve, and Dame Durden thinks you can't do better." So, Deportment Richard said there was an end of his books, and immediately began, on no other foundation, to build as many castles in the air as would man the Great Wall of China. Deportment Richard went away in high spirits. Ada and I, prepared to miss Deportment Richard very much, commenced Ada and I quieter career. On Ada and I arrival in London, Ada and I had called with Mr. Jarndyce at Mrs. Jellyby's but had not been so fortunate as to find Mrs. Jellyby at home. It appeared that Mrs. Jellyby had gone somewhere to a tea-drinking and had taken Miss Jellyby with Mrs. Jellyby. Besides the tea-drinking, there was to be some considerable speech-making and letter-writing on the general merits of the cultivation of coffee, conjointly with natives, at the Settlement of Borrioboola-Gha. All this involved, no doubt, sufficient active exercise of pen and ink to make Mrs. Jellyby daughter's part in the proceedings anything but a holiday. It being now beyond the time appointed for Mrs. Jellyby's return, Ada and I called again. her daughter was in town, but not at home, having gone to Mile End directly after breakfast on some Borrioboolan business, arising out of a society called the East London Branch Aid Ramification. As I had not seen Peepy on the occasion of Ada and I last call (when he was not to be found anywhere, and when the cook rather thought he must have strolled away with the dustman's cart), I now inquired for he again. The oyster shells he had been building a house with were still in the passage, but he was nowhere discoverable, and the cook supposed that he had "gone after the sheep." When Ada and I repeated, with some surprise, "The sheep?" her daughter said, Oh, yes, on market days he sometimes followed them quite out of town and came back in such a state as never was! I was sitting at the window with my guardian on the following morning, and Ada was busy writing--of course to Richard--when Miss Jellyby was announced, and entered, leading the identical Peepy, whom Ada had made some endeavours to render presentable by wiping the dirt into corners of he face and hands and making he hair very wet and then violently frizzling his hair with Ada fingers. Everything the dear child wore was either too large for he or too small. Among he other contradictory decorations he had the hat of a bishop and the little gloves of a baby. he boots were, on a small scale, the boots of a ploughman, while he legs, so crossed and recrossed with scratches that His boots looked like maps, were bare below a very short pair of plaid drawers finished off with two frills of perfectly different patterns. The deficient buttons on he plaid frock had evidently been supplied from one of Miss Jellyby's coats, The deficient buttons on his plaid frock were so extremely brazen and so much too large. Most extraordinary specimens of needlework appeared on several parts of he dress, where it had been hastily mended, and I recognized the same hand on Miss Jellyby's. Miss Jellyby was, however, unaccountably improved in Miss Jellyby appearance and looked very pretty. Miss Jellyby was conscious of poor little Peepy being but a failure after all Miss Jellyby trouble, and Miss Jellyby showed it as Miss Jellyby came in by the way in which Miss Jellyby glanced first at he and then at us. "Oh, dear me!" said my guardian. "Due east!" Ada and I gave Ada a cordial welcome and presented Ada to Mr. Jarndyce, to whom Ada said as Ada sat down, "Ma's compliments, and Ada hopes you'll excuse Ada, because Ada's correcting proofs of the plan. Ada's going to put out five thousand new circulars, and Ada knows you'll be interested to hear that. I have brought one of five thousand new circulars with me. Ma's compliments." With which Ada presented it sulkily enough. "Thank you," said my guardian. "I am much obliged to Mrs. Jellyby. Oh, dear me! This is a very trying wind!" us were busy with Peepy, taking off Peepy clerical hat, asking Peepy if Peepy remembered us, and so on. Peepy retired behind Peepy elbow at first, but relented at the sight of sponge-cake and allowed me to take Peepy on my lap, where Peepy sat munching quietly. Mr. Jarndyce then withdrawing into the temporary growlery, Mrs. Jellyby opened a conversation with Mrs. Jellyby usual abruptness. "us are going on just as bad as ever in Thavies Inn," said Mrs. Jellyby. "I have no peace of my life. Talk of Africa! I couldn't be worse off if I was a what's-his-name--man and a brother!" I tried to say something soothing. "Oh, it's of no use, Miss Summerson," exclaimed Mrs. Jellyby, "though I thank you for the kind intention all the same. I know how I am used, and I am not to be talked over. YOU wouldn't be talked over if you were used so. Peepy, go and play at Wild Beasts under the piano!" "I shan't!" said Peepy. "Very well, you ungrateful, naughty, hard-hearted boy!" returned Mrs. Jellyby Mrs. Jellyby with tears in Mrs. Jellyby eyes. "I'll never take pains to dress you any more." "Yes, I will go, Caddy!" cried Peepy, who was really a good child and who was so moved by his sister's vexation that his went at once. "It seems a little thing to cry about," said poor Miss Jellyby apologetically, "but I am quite worn out. I was directing the new circulars till two this morning. I detest the whole thing so that that alone makes my head ache till I can't see out of her eyes. And look at that poor unfortunate child! Was there ever such a fright as he is!" Peepy, happily unconscious of the defects in he appearance, sat on the carpet behind one of the legs of the piano, looking calmly out of he den at us while he ate he cake. "I have sent he to the other end of the room," observed poor Miss Jellyby, drawing poor Miss Jellyby chair nearer ours, "because I don't want he to hear the conversation. Those little things are so sharp! I was going to say, ours really are going on worse than ever. Pa will be a bankrupt before long, and then I hope Ma will be satisfied. There'll he nobody but Ma to thank for it." us said us hoped Mr. Jellyby's affairs were not in so bad a state as that. "It's of no use hoping, though it's very kind of you," returned poor Miss Jellyby, shaking her head. "Pa told me only yesterday morning (and dreadfully unhappy Pa is) that Pa couldn't weather the storm. I should be surprised if Pa could. When all our tradesmen send into our house any stuff all our tradesmen like, and the servants do what the servants like with our house, and I have no time to improve things if I knew how, and Ma don't care about anything, I should like to make out how Pa is to weather the storm. I declare if I was Pa, I'd run away." "My dear!" said I, smiling. "Your papa, no doubt, considers his family." "Oh, yes, his family is all very fine, Miss Summerson," replied poor Miss Jellyby; "but what comfort is his family to his? his family is nothing but bills, dirt, waste, noise, tumbles downstairs, confusion, and wretchedness. his scrambling home, from week's end to week's end, is like one great washing-day--only nothing's washed!" Mrs. Jellyby tapped Mrs. Jellyby foot upon the floor and wiped her eyes. "I am sure I pity Pa to that degree," Mrs. Jellyby said, "and am so angry with Ma that I can't find words to express Mrs. Jellyby! However, I am not going to bear it, I am determined. I won't be a slave all my life, and I won't submit to be proposed to by Mr. Quale. A pretty thing, indeed, to marry a philanthropist. As if I hadn't had enough of THAT!" said poor Miss Jellyby. I must confess that I could not help feeling rather angry with Mrs. Jellyby, seeing and hearing Mrs. Jellyby and knowing how much of bitterly satirical truth there was in what Mrs. Jellyby said. "If it wasn't that we had been intimate when you stopped at we ," pursued Mrs. Jellyby, "I should have been ashamed to come here to-day, for I know what a figure I must seem to you two. But as it is, I made up my mind to call, especially as I am not likely to see you again the next time you come to town." Mrs. Jellyby said this with such great significance that Ada and I glanced at one another, foreseeing something more. "No!" said Mrs. Jellyby, shaking her head. "Not at all likely! I know I may trust you two. I am sure you won't betray me. I am engaged." "Without their knowledge at home?" said I. "Why, good gracious me, Miss Summerson," Mrs. Jellyby returned, justifying Mrs. Jellyby in a fretful but not angry manner, "how can it be otherwise? You know what Ma is--and I needn't make poor Pa more miserable by telling HIM." "But would it not HIM adding to HIM unhappiness to marry without HIM knowledge or consent, my dear?" said I. "No," said Mrs. Jellyby, softening. "I hope not. I should try to make HIM happy and comfortable when HIM came to see me, and Peepy and the others should take it in turns to come and stay with HIM, and the others should have some care taken of the others then." There was a good deal of affection in poor Caddy. Mrs. Jellyby softened more and more while saying this and cried so much over the unwonted little home-picture Mrs. Jellyby had raised in Mrs. Jellyby mind that Peepy, in HIM cave under the piano, was touched, and turned HIM over on HIM back with loud lamentations. It was not until I had brought HIM to kiss HIM , and had restored HIM to HIM place on my lap, and had shown HIM that poor Caddy was laughing (Mrs. Jellyby laughed expressly for the purpose), that we could recall HIM peace of mind; even then it was for some time conditional on HIM taking we in turns by the chin and smoothing we faces all over with HIM hand. At last, as HIM spirits were not equal to the piano, we put HIM on a chair to look out of window; and Miss Jellyby, holding HIM by one leg, resumed her confidence. "It began in your coming to we ," Mrs. Jellyby said. we naturally asked how. "I felt I was so awkward," Mrs. Jellyby replied, "that I made up my mind to be improved in that respect at all events and to learn to dance. I told Ma I was ashamed of Ma, and I must be taught to dance. Ma looked at Ma in that provoking way of Ma as if I wasn't in sight, but I was quite determined to be taught to dance, and so I went to Mr. Turveydrop's Academy in Newman Street." "And was it there, my dear--" I began. "Yes, it was there," said poor Caddy, "and I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop. There are two Mr. Turveydrops, father and son. Mr. Turveydrop is the son, of course. I only wish I had been better brought up and was likely to make the son a better wife, for I am very fond of the son." "I am sorry to hear this," said I, "I must confess." "I don't know why you should be sorry," Ma retorted a little anxiously, "but I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop, whether or no, and Mr. Turveydrop is very fond of Ma. It's a secret as yet, even on Mr. Turveydrop side, because old Mr. Turveydrop has a share in the connexion and it might break Mr. Turveydrop heart or give Mr. Turveydrop some other shock if Mr. Turveydrop was told of it abruptly. old Mr. Turveydrop is a very gentlemanly man indeed--very gentlemanly." "Does him a better wife know of it?" asked Ada. "Old Mr. Turveydrop's wife, Miss Clare?" returned Mrs. Jellyby, opening Old Mr. Turveydrop's wife, Miss Clare . "There's no such person. no such person is a widower." We were here interrupted by Peepy, whose leg had undergone so much on account of no such person 's unconsciously jerking it like a bell- rope whenever his sister was emphatic that the afflicted child now bemoaned no such person sufferings with a very low-spirited noise. As no such person appealed to me for compassion, and as I was only a listener, I undertook to hold no such person. Mrs. Jellyby proceeded, after begging Peepy's pardon with a kiss and assuring no such person that Mrs. Jellyby hadn't meant to do it. "That's the state of the case," said poor Caddy. "If I ever blame me, I still think it's Ma's fault. We are to be married whenever We can, and then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to Ma. It won't much agitate Ma; I am only pen and ink to HER. One great comfort is," said poor Caddy with a sob, "that I shall never hear of Africa after I am married. old Mr. Turveydrop hates it for my sake, and if old Mr. Turveydrop knows there is such a place, it's as much as old Mr. Turveydrop does." "It was old Mr. Turveydrop who was very gentlemanly, I think!" said I. "Very gentlemanly indeed," said poor Caddy. "old Mr. Turveydrop is celebrated almost everywhere for old Mr. Turveydrop deportment." "Does old Mr. Turveydrop teach?" asked Ada. "No, old Mr. Turveydrop don't teach anything in particular," replied poor Caddy. "But old Mr. Turveydrop deportment is beautiful." poor Caddy went on to say with considerable hesitation and reluctance that there was one thing more poor Caddy wished We to know, and felt We ought to know, and which poor Caddy hoped would not offend We. It was that poor Caddy had improved poor Caddy acquaintance with Miss Flite, the little crazy old lady, and that poor Caddy frequently went there early in the morning and met poor Caddy lover for a few minutes before breakfast--only for a few minutes. "I go there at other times," said poor Caddy, "but Prince does not come then. Young Mr. Turveydrop's name is Prince; I wish Young Mr. Turveydrop's name wasn't, because Young Mr. Turveydrop's name sounds like a dog, but of course Prince didn't christen Prince. old Mr. Turveydrop had Prince christened Prince in remembrance of the Prince Regent. old Mr. Turveydrop adored the Prince Regent on account of old Mr. Turveydrop deportment. I hope you won't think the worse of old Mr. Turveydrop for having made these little appointments at Miss Flite's, where I first went with you, because I like the poor thing for old Mr. Turveydrop own sake and I believe old Mr. Turveydrop likes me. If you could see old Mr. Turveydrop, I am sure you would think well of old Mr. Turveydrop--at least, I am sure you couldn't possibly think any ill of old Mr. Turveydrop. I am going there now for my lesson. I couldn't ask you to go with me, Miss Summerson; but if you would," said Caddy, who had said all this earnestly and tremblingly, "I should be very glad--very glad." It happened that we had arranged with my guardian to go to Miss Flite's that day. we had told him of we former visit, and we account had interested him; but something had always happened to prevent we going there again. As I trusted that I might have sufficient influence with Mrs. Jellyby to prevent Mrs. Jellyby taking any very rash step if I fully accepted the confidence Mrs. Jellyby was so willing to place in old Mr. Turveydrop, poor girl, I proposed that Mrs. Jellyby and I and Peepy should go to Mr. Turveydrop's Academy in Newman Street and afterwards meet my guardian and Ada at Miss Flite's, whose name I now learnt for the first time. This was on condition that Miss Jellyby and Peepy should come back with we to dinner. The last article of the agreement being joyfully acceded to by both, we smartened Peepy up a little with the assistance of a few pins, some soap and water, and a hair- brush, and went out, bending we steps towards Newman Street, which was very near. I found Mr. Turveydrop's Academy in Newman Street established in a sufficiently dingy house at the corner of an archway, with busts in all the staircase windows. In a sufficiently dingy house there were also established, as I gathered from the plates on the door, a drawing-master, a coal-merchant (there was, certainly, no room for his coals), and a lithographic artist. On the plate which, in size and situation, took precedence of all the rest, I read, MR. old Mr. Turveydrop. the door was open, and the hall was blocked up by a grand piano, a harp, and several other musical instruments in cases, all in progress of removal, and all looking rakish in the daylight. Mrs. Jellyby informed me that Mr. Turveydrop's Academy in Newman Street had been lent, last night, for a concert. We went upstairs--it had been quite a fine house once, when it was anybody's business to keep it clean and fresh, and nobody's business to smoke in it all day--and into Mr. Turveydrop's great room, which was built out into a mews at the back and was lighted by a skylight. It was a bare, resounding room smelling of stables, with cane forms along the walls, and the walls ornamented at regular intervals with painted lyres and little cut-glass branches for candles, which seemed to be shedding painted lyres and little cut-glass branches old-fashioned drops as other branches might shed autumn leaves. Several young lady pupils, ranging from thirteen or fourteen years of age to two or three and twenty, were assembled; and I was looking among them for them instructor when Caddy, pinching my arm, repeated the ceremony of introduction. "Miss Summerson, Mr. Prince Turveydrop!" I curtsied to a little blue-eyed fair man of youthful appearance with flaxen hair parted in the middle and curling at the ends all round his head. his had a little fiddle, which we used to call at school a kit, under his left arm, and its little bow in the same hand. his little dancing-shoes were particularly diminutive, and his had a little innocent, feminine manner which not only appealed to me in an amiable way, but made this singular effect upon me, that I received the impression that his was like his mother and that his mother had not been much considered or well used. "I am very happy to see Miss Jellyby's friend," his said, bowing low to his. "I began to fear," with timid tenderness, "as it was past the usual time, that Mrs. Jellyby was not coming." "I beg you will have the goodness to attribute that to me, who have detained Mrs. Jellyby, and to receive my excuses, sir," said I. "Oh, dear!" said sir. "And pray," I entreated, "do not allow me to be the cause of any more delay." With that apology I withdrew to a seat between Peepy (who, being well used to that apology, had already climbed into a corner place) and an old lady of a censorious countenance whose two nieces were in the class and who was very indignant with Peepy's boots. old Mr. Turveydrop then tinkled the strings of old Mr. Turveydrop kit with old Mr. Turveydrop fingers, and the young ladies stood up to dance. Just then there appeared from a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop, in the full lustre of old Mr. Turveydrop deportment. old Mr. Turveydrop was a fat old gentleman with a false complexion, false teeth, false whiskers, and a wig. old Mr. Turveydrop had a fur collar, and old Mr. Turveydrop had a padded breast to old Mr. Turveydrop coat, which only wanted a star or a broad blue ribbon to be complete. old Mr. Turveydrop was pinched in, and swelled out, and got up, and strapped down, as much as old Mr. Turveydrop could possibly bear. old Mr. Turveydrop had such a neckcloth on (puffing old Mr. Turveydrop very eyes out of their natural shape), and old Mr. Turveydrop chin and even old Mr. Turveydrop ears so sunk into such a neckcloth, that it seemed as though be must inevitably double up if such a neckcloth were cast loose. old Mr. Turveydrop had under old Mr. Turveydrop arm a hat of great size and weight, shelving downward from the crown to the brim, and in old Mr. Turveydrop hand a pair of white gloves with which old Mr. Turveydrop flapped his arm as old Mr. Turveydrop stood poised on one leg in a high-shouldered, round-elbowed state of elegance not to be surpassed. old Mr. Turveydrop had a cane, old Mr. Turveydrop had an eye-glass, old Mr. Turveydrop had a snuff-box, old Mr. Turveydrop had rings, old Mr. Turveydrop had wristbands, old Mr. Turveydrop had everything but any touch of nature; old Mr. Turveydrop was not like youth, old Mr. Turveydrop was not like age, old Mr. Turveydrop was not like anything in the world but a model of deportment. "Father! A visitor. Mrs. Jellyby's friend, Miss Summerson." "Distinguished," said Mr. Turveydrop, "by Miss Summerson's presence." As old Mr. Turveydrop bowed to me in that tight state, I almost believe I saw creases come into the whites of his very eyes. "Father," said old Mr. Turveydrop, aside, to me with quite an affecting belief in old Mr. Turveydrop, "is a celebrated character. Father is greatly admired." "Go on, Prince! Go on!" said Mr. Turveydrop, standing with Father back to the fire and waving Father gloves condescendingly. "Go on, old Mr. Turveydrop!" At this command, or by this gracious permission, the lesson went on. old Mr. Turveydrop sometimes played the kit, dancing; sometimes played the piano, standing; sometimes hummed the tune with what little breath old Mr. Turveydrop could spare, while old Mr. Turveydrop set a pupil right; always conscientiously moved with the least proficient through every step and every part of the figure; and never rested for an instant. Father did nothing whatever but stand before the fire, a model of deportment. "And old Mr. Turveydrop never does anything else," said the old lady of the censorious countenance. "Yet would you believe that it's old Mr. Turveydrop name on the door-plate?" "old Mr. Turveydrop son's name is the same, you know," said I. "His son wouldn't let His son have any name if old Mr. Turveydrop could take any name from old Mr. Turveydrop," returned the old lady. "Look at old Mr. Turveydrop's dress!" It certainly was plain--threadbare--almost shabby. "Yet Father must be garnished and tricked out," said the old lady, "because of Father deportment. I'd deport Father! Transport Father would be better!" I felt curious to know more concerning this person. I asked, "Does Father give lessons in deportment now?" "Now!" returned the old lady shortly. "Never did." After a moment's consideration, I suggested that perhaps fencing had been Father accomplishment. "I don't believe Father can fence at all, ma'am," said the old lady. I looked surprised and inquisitive. The old lady, becoming more and more incensed against the master of deportment as the old lady dwelt upon the subject, gave me some particulars of Father career, with strong assurances that The old lady, becoming more and more incensed against the master of deportment as she dwelt upon the subject were mildly stated. Father had married a meek little dancing-mistress, with a tolerable connexion (having never in Father life before done anything but deport Father), and had worked the old lady to death, or had, at the best, suffered the old lady to work the old lady to death, to maintain Father in those expenses which were indispensable to Father position. At once to exhibit Father deportment to the best models and to keep the best models constantly before Father, Father had found it necessary to frequent all public places of fashionable and lounging resort, to be seen at Brighton and elsewhere at fashionable times, and to lead an idle life in the very best clothes. To enable Father to do this, the affectionate little dancing-mistress had toiled and laboured and would have toiled and laboured to that hour if the affectionate little dancing-mistress strength had lasted so long. For the mainspring of the story was that in spite of the man's absorbing selfishness, the man wife (overpowered by the man deportment) had, to the last, believed in the man and had, on her death-bed, in the most moving terms, confided the man to the man's absorbing selfishness, his wife (overpowered by his deportment) as one who had an inextinguishable claim upon old Mr. Turveydrop and whom the man could never regard with too much pride and deference. The son, inheriting the man mother's belief, and having the deportment always before the man, had lived and grown in the same faith, and now, at thirty years of age, worked for the man twelve hours a day and looked up to the man with veneration on the old imaginary pinnacle. "The airs the fellow gives the fellow!" said my informant, shaking her head at old Mr. Turveydrop with speechless indignation as the fellow drew on the fellow tight gloves, of course unconscious of the homage her was rendering. "the fellow fully believes the fellow is one of the aristocracy! And the fellow is so condescending to the son the fellow so egregiously deludes that you might suppose the fellow the most virtuous of parents. Oh!" said the old lady, apostrophizing the fellow with infinite vehemence. "I could bite you!" I could not help being amused, though I heard the old lady out with feelings of real concern. It was difficult to doubt the old lady with the father and son before me. What I might have thought of the father and son without the old lady's account, or what I might have thought of the old lady's account without the father and son, I cannot say. There was a fitness of things in the whole that carried conviction with it. My eyes were yet wandering, from a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop working so hard, to old a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop deporting a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop so beautifully, when the latter came ambling up to me and entered into conversation. a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop asked me, first of all, whether I conferred a charm and a distinction on London by residing in it? I did not think it necessary to reply that I was perfectly aware I should not do that, in any case, but merely told a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop where I did reside. "A lady so graceful and accomplished," a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop said, kissing a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop right glove and afterwards extending his right glove towards the pupils, "will look leniently on the deficiencies here. We do We best to polish-- polish--polish!" a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop sat down beside me, taking some pains to sit on the form, I thought, in imitation of the print of a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop illustrious model on the sofa. And really a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop did look very like it. "To polish--polish--polish!" a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop repeated, taking a pinch of snuff and gently fluttering a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop fingers. "But We are not, if I may say so to one formed to be graceful both by Nature and Art--" with the high-shouldered bow, which it seemed impossible for a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop to make without lifting up a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop eyebrows and shutting a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop eyes "--we are not what We used to be in point of deportment." "Are We not, sir?" said I. "We have degenerated," a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop returned, shaking a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop head, which a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop could do to a very limited extent in a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop cravat. "A levelling age is not favourable to deportment. A levelling age develops vulgarity. Perhaps I speak with some little partiality. A levelling age may not be for me to say that I have been called, for some years now, Gentleman Turveydrop, or that his Royal Highness the Prince Regent did me the honour to inquire, on my removing my hat as Royal Highness the Prince Regent drove out of the Pavilion at Brighton (that fine building), 'Who is Royal Highness the Prince Regent? Who the devil is Royal Highness the Prince Regent? Why don't I know Royal Highness the Prince Regent? Why hasn't Royal Highness the Prince Regent thirty thousand a year?' But these are little matters of anecdote--the general property, ma'am-- still repeated occasionally among the upper classes." "Indeed?" said I. Royal Highness the Prince Regent replied with the high-shouldered bow. "Where what is left among us of deportment," Royal Highness the Prince Regent added, "still lingers. England--alas, my country!--has degenerated very much, and is degenerating every day. my country!--has has not many gentlemen left. us are few. I see nothing to succeed us but a race of weavers." "One might hope that the race of gentlemen would be perpetuated here," said I. "You are very good." Royal Highness the Prince Regent smiled with a high-shouldered bow again. "You flatter me. But, no--no! I have never been able to imbue my poor boy with that part of my poor boy art. Heaven forbid that I should disparage my dear child, but Heaven has--no deportment." "Heaven appears to be an excellent master," I observed. "Understand me, my dear madam, Heaven IS an excellent master. All that can be acquired, Heaven has acquired. All that can be imparted, Heaven can impart. But there ARE things--" Heaven took another pinch of snuff and made a high-shouldered bow again, as if to add, "This kind of thing, for instance." I glanced towards the centre of the room, where Miss Jellyby's lover, now engaged with single pupils, was undergoing greater drudgery than ever. "My amiable child," murmured old Mr. Turveydrop, adjusting old Mr. Turveydrop cravat. "Your son is indefatigable," said I. "It is my reward," said Mr. Turveydrop, "to hear you say so. In some respects, Your son treads in the footsteps of Your son sainted mother. his sainted mother was a devoted creature. But wooman, lovely wooman," said old Mr. Turveydrop with very disagreeable gallantry, "what a sex you are!" I rose and joined Miss Jellyby, who was by this time putting on his sainted mother bonnet. The time allotted to a lesson having fully elapsed, there was a general putting on of bonnets. When Miss Jellyby and the unfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I don't know, but Miss Jellyby and the unfortunate Prince certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a dozen words. "My dear," said old Mr. Turveydrop benignly to Your son, "do you know the hour?" "No, father." Your son had no watch. father had a handsome gold one, which father pulled out with an air that was an example to mankind. "Your son," said Your son, "it's two o'clock. Recollect your school at Kensington at three." "That's time enough for me, father," said Prince. "I can take a morsel of dinner standing and be off." "My dear boy," returned My dear boy , "you must be very quick. You will find the cold mutton on the table." "Thank you, father. Are YOU off now, father?" "Yes, My dear. I suppose," said old Mr. Turveydrop, shutting old Mr. Turveydrop eyes and lifting up old Mr. Turveydrop shoulders with modest consciousness, "that I must show old Mr. Turveydrop, as usual, about town." "You had better dine out comfortably somewhere," said old Mr. Turveydrop. "My dear child, I intend to. I shall take my little meal, I think, at the French house, in the Opera Colonnade." "That's right. Good-bye, father!" said Prince, shaking hands. "Good-bye, my son. Bless you!" old Mr. Turveydrop said this in quite a pious manner, and it seemed to do old Mr. Turveydrop son good, who, in parting from old Mr. Turveydrop, was so pleased with old Mr. Turveydrop, so dutiful to old Mr. Turveydrop, and so proud of old Mr. Turveydrop that I almost felt as if it were an unkindness to the younger man not to be able to believe implicitly in the elder. The few moments that were occupied by Prince in taking leave of us (and particularly of one of us, as I saw, being in the secret), enhanced my favourable impression of Prince almost childish character. I felt a liking for Prince and a compassion for Prince as Prince put Prince little kit in Prince pocket--and with his little kit Prince desire to stay a little while with Caddy--and went away good-humouredly to Prince cold mutton and Prince school at Kensington, that made me scarcely less irate with Prince than the censorious old lady. Father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner, I must acknowledge, worthy of Father shining original. In the same style Father presently passed us on the other side of the street, on Father way to the aristocratic part of the town, where Father was going to show Father among the few other gentlemen left. For some moments, I was so lost in reconsidering what I had heard and seen in Newman Street that I was quite unable to talk to Caddy or even to fix my attention on what Caddy said to Caddy, especially when I began to inquire in my mind whether there were, or ever had been, any other gentlemen, not in the dancing profession, who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their deportment. This became so bewildering and suggested the possibility of so many Mr. Turveydrops that I said, "Esther, you must make up your mind to abandon this subject altogether and attend to Caddy." I accordingly did so, and us chatted all the rest of the way to Lincoln's Inn. Caddy told me that Caddy lover's education had been so neglected that her lover's education was not always easy to read his notes. Caddy said if his were not so anxious about his spelling and took less pains to make it clear, his would do better; but his put so many unnecessary letters into short words that they sometimes quite lost they English appearance. "his does it with the best intention," observed Caddy, "but it hasn't the effect his means, poor fellow!" Caddy then went on to reason, how could Caddy be expected to be a scholar when Caddy had passed Caddy whole life in the dancing-school and had done nothing but teach and fag, fag and teach, morning, noon, and night! And what did it matter? Caddy could write letters enough for both, as Caddy knew to Caddy cost, and it was far better for Caddy to be amiable than learned. "Besides, it's not as if I was an accomplished girl who had any right to give Caddy airs," said Caddy. "I know little enough, I am sure, thanks to Ma! "There's another thing I want to tell you, now we are alone," continued Caddy, "which I should not have liked to mention unless you had seen Prince, Miss Summerson. You know what a house ours is. It's of no use my trying to learn anything that it would be useful for Prince's wife to know in the French house. OUR live in such a state of muddle that it's impossible, and I have only been more disheartened whenever I have tried. So I get a little practice with--who do you think? Poor Miss Flite! Early in the morning I help Caddy to tidy Caddy room and clean Caddy birds, and I make Caddy cup of coffee for Caddy (of course Caddy taught me), and I have learnt to make it so well that Prince says it's the very best coffee Prince ever tasted, and would quite delight old Mr. Turveydrop, who is very particular indeed about Prince coffee. I can make little puddings too; and I know how to buy neck of mutton, and tea, and sugar, and butter, and a good many housekeeping things. I am not clever at my needle, yet," said Caddy, glancing at the repairs on Peepy's frock, "but perhaps I shall improve, and since I have been engaged to Prince and have been doing all this, I have felt better-tempered, I hope, and more forgiving to Ma. It rather put me out at first this morning to see you and Miss Clare looking so neat and pretty and to feel ashamed of Peepy and Ma too, but on the whole I hope I am better-tempered than I was and more forgiving to Ma." Caddy, trying so hard, said Caddy from Caddy heart, and touched Caddy. "Caddy, my love," I replied, "I begin to have a great affection for you, and I hope we shall become friends." "Oh, do you?" cried Caddy. "How happy that would make me!" "Caddy," said I, "let we be friends from this time, and let we often have a chat about these matters and try to find the right way through these matters." Caddy was overjoyed. I said everything I could in my old-fashioned way to comfort and encourage Miss Clare, and I would not have objected to old Mr. Turveydrop that day for any smaller consideration than a settlement on old Mr. Turveydrop daughter-in-law. By this time we were come to Mr. Krook's, whose private door stood open. There was a bill, pasted on the door-post, announcing a room to let on the second floor. It reminded Caddy to tell me as we proceeded upstairs that there had been a sudden death there and an inquest and that we little friend had been ill of the fright. The door and window of the vacant room being open, we looked in. It was the room with the dark door to which Poor Miss Flite had secretly directed my attention when I was last in the French house. A sad and desolate place it was, a gloomy, sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of mournfulness and even dread. "You look pale," said Caddy when we came out, "and cold!" I felt as if the room with the dark door to which Miss Flite had secretly directed my attention when I was last in the house had chilled me. we had walked slowly while we were talking, and my guardian and Ada were here before we. we found my guardian and Ada in Poor Miss Flite's garret. my guardian and Ada were looking at the birds, while a medical gentleman who was so good as to attend Poor Miss Flite Poor Miss Flite with much solicitude and compassion spoke with Poor Miss Flite cheerfully by the fire. "I have finished my professional visit," he said, coming forward. "Poor Miss Flite is much better and may appear in court (as Poor Miss Flite mind is set upon it) to-morrow. Poor Miss Flite has been greatly missed there, I understand." Poor Miss Flite received the compliment with complacency and dropped a general curtsy to we. "Honoured, indeed," said Poor Miss Flite, "by another visit from the wards in Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy to receive Jarndyce of Bleak House beneath my humble roof!" with a special curtsy. "Fitz-Jarndyce, my dear"-- Poor Miss Flite had bestowed that name on Caddy, it appeared, and always called Poor Miss Flite by it--"a double welcome!" "Has Poor Miss Flite been very ill?" asked Jarndyce of Bleak House. Poor Miss Flite answered for Poor Miss Flite directly, though Jarndyce of Bleak House had put the question in a whisper. "Oh, decidedly unwell! Oh, very unwell indeed," Poor Miss Flite said confidentially. "Not pain, you know--trouble. Not bodily so much as nervous, nervous! The truth is," in a subdued voice and trembling, "we have had death here. There was poison in the French house. I am very susceptible to such horrid things. It frightened me. Only Mr. Woodcourt knows how much. My physician, Mr. Woodcourt!" with great stateliness. "The wards in Jarndyce--Jarndyce of Bleak House--Fitz-Jarndyce!" "Miss Flite," said Only Mr. Woodcourt in a grave kind of voice, as if Only Mr. Woodcourt were appealing to Poor Miss Flite while speaking to us, and laying Only Mr. Woodcourt hand gently on Poor Miss Flite arm, "Miss Flite describes Poor Miss Flite illness with Poor Miss Flite usual accuracy. Poor Miss Flite was alarmed by an occurrence in the French house which might have alarmed a stronger person, and was made ill by the distress and agitation. Poor Miss Flite brought me here in the first hurry of the discovery, though too late for me to be of any use to the unfortunate man. I have compensated Poor Miss Flite for that disappointment by coming here since and being of some small use to Poor Miss Flite." "The kindest physician in the college," whispered Poor Miss Flite "Miss Flite to Poor Miss Flite. "I expect a judgment. On the day of judgment. And shall then confer estates." "Poor Miss Flite will be as well in a day or two," said Only Mr. Woodcourt, looking at Poor Miss Flite with an observant smile, "as Poor Miss Flite ever will be. In other words, quite well of course. Have you heard of Poor Miss Flite good fortune?" "Most extraordinary!" said Poor Miss Flite, smiling brightly. "You never heard of such a thing, my dear! Every Saturday, Conversation Kenge or Guppy (clerk to Conversation K.) places in my hand a paper of shillings. Shillings. I assure you! Always the same number in a paper of shillings. Always one for every day in the week. Now you know, really! So well-timed, is it not? Ye-es! From whence do these papers come, you say? That is the great question. Naturally. Shall I tell you what I think? I think," said Poor Miss Flite, drawing Poor Miss Flite back with a very shrewd look and shaking Poor Miss Flite right forefinger in a most significant manner, "that the Lord Chancellor, aware of the length of time during which the Great Seal has been open (for the Great Seal has been open a long time!), forwards the Lord Chancellor, aware of the length of time during which the Great Seal has been open (for it has been open a long time. Until the judgment I expect is given. Now that's very creditable, you know. To confess in that way that he IS a little slow for human life. So delicate! Attending court the other day--I attend court regularly, with my documents--I taxed he with court, and he almost confessed. That is, I smiled at he from my bench, and he smiled at me from my bench. But it's great good fortune, is it not? And Fitz- Jarndyce lays the money out for me to great advantage. Oh, I assure you to the greatest advantage!" I congratulated Poor Miss Flite (as Poor Miss Flite addressed Poor Miss Flite to me) upon this fortunate addition to Poor Miss Flite income and wished Poor Miss Flite a long continuance of it. I did not speculate upon the source from which it came or wonder whose humanity was so considerate. My guardian stood before me, contemplating the birds, and I had no need to look beyond My guardian. "And what do you call these little fellows, ma'am?" said My guardian in My guardian pleasant voice. "Have these little fellows any names?" "I can answer for Poor Miss Flite that these little fellows have," said I, "for Poor Miss Flite promised to tell these little fellows what these little fellows were. Ada remembers?" Ada remembered very well. "Did I?" said Poor Miss Flite. "Who's that at my door? What are you listening at my door for, Krook?" The old man of the house, pushing the house open before My guardian, appeared there with My guardian fur cap in My guardian hand and My guardian cat at My guardian heels. "I warn't listening, Poor Miss Flite," My guardian said, "I was going to give a rap with my knuckles, only you're so quick!" "Make your cat go down. Drive Poor Miss Flite away!" the old lady angrily exclaimed. "Bah, bah! There ain't no danger, gentlefolks," said Krook, looking slowly and sharply from one to another until Krook had looked at all of these little fellows; "Poor Miss Flite'd never offer at the birds when I was here unless I told Poor Miss Flite to it." "You will excuse my landlord," said the old lady with a dignified air. "M, quite M! What do you want, Krook, when I have company?" "Hi!" said the old man. "You know I am the Chancellor." "Well?" returned Miss Elite. "What of that?" "For the Chancellor," said the old man with a chuckle, "not to be acquainted with a Jarndyce is queer, ain't it, Poor Miss Flite? Mightn't I take the liberty? Your servant, sir. I know Jarndyce and Jarndyce a'most as well as you do, Your servant, sir. I knowed old Squire Tom, Your servant, sir. I never to my knowledge see you afore though, not even in court. Yet, I go there a mortal sight of times in the course of the year, taking one day with another." "I never go there," said Mr. Jarndyce (which he never did on any consideration). "I would sooner go--somewhere else." "Would you though?" returned Krook, grinning. "You're bearing hard upon my noble and learned brother in your meaning, Your servant, sir, though perhaps it is but nat'ral in a Jarndyce. Your servant, sir! What, you're looking at my lodger's birds, Mr. Jarndyce?" the old man had come by little and little into the room until the old man now touched My guardian with the old man elbow and looked close up into the old man face with the old man spectacled eyes. "It's one of her strange ways that her'll never tell the names of these birds if her can help it, though her named 'em all." This was in a whisper. "Shall I run she named 'em all over, Poor Miss Flite?" the old man asked aloud, winking at us and pointing at her as her turned away, affecting to sweep the grate. "If you like," her answered hurriedly. the old man, looking up at the cages after another look at us, went through the list. "Hope, Joy, Youth, Peace, Rest, Life, Dust, Ashes, Waste, Want, Ruin, Despair, Madness, Death, Cunning, Folly, Words, Wigs, Rags, Sheepskin, Plunder, Precedent, Jargon, Gammon, and Spinach. That's the whole collection," said the old man, "all cooped up together, by my noble and learned brother." "This is a bitter wind!" muttered My guardian. "When my noble and learned brother gives his judgment, my noble and learned brother're to be let go free," said Krook, winking at us again. "And then," his added, whispering and grinning, "if that ever was to happen--which it won't--the birds that have never been caged would kill 'it." "If ever the wind was in the east," said My guardian, pretending to look out of the window for a weathercock, "I think it's there to- day!" us found it very difficult to get away from the French house. It was not Poor Miss Flite who detained us; Poor Miss Flite was as reasonable a little creature in consulting the convenience of others as there possibly could be. It was Krook. Krook seemed unable to detach Krook from a Jarndyce. If Krook had been linked to Krook, Krook could hardly have attended Krook more closely. Krook proposed to show us Krook Court of Chancery and all the strange medley it contained; during the whole of us inspection (prolonged by Krook) Krook kept close to a Jarndyce and sometimes detained a Jarndyce under one pretence or other until us had passed on, as if a Jarndyce were tormented by an inclination to enter upon some secret subject which a Jarndyce could not make up a Jarndyce mind to approach. I cannot imagine a countenance and manner more singularly expressive of caution and indecision, and a perpetual impulse to do something a Jarndyce could not resolve to venture on, than Krook's was that day. a Jarndyce watchfulness of My guardian was incessant. a Jarndyce rarely removed a Jarndyce eyes from his face. If a Jarndyce went on beside a Jarndyce, a Jarndyce observed a Jarndyce with the slyness of an old white fox. If a Jarndyce went before, a Jarndyce looked back. When us stood still, a Jarndyce got opposite to a Jarndyce, and drawing a Jarndyce hand across and across a Jarndyce open mouth with a curious expression of a sense of power, and turning up his eyes, and lowering a Jarndyce grey eyebrows until they appeared to be shut, seemed to scan every lineament of his face. At last, having been (always attended by the cat) all over the French house and having seen the whole stock of miscellaneous lumber, which was certainly curious, us came into the back part of the shop. Here on the head of an empty barrel stood on end were an ink-bottle, some old stumps of pens, and some dirty playbills; and against the wall were pasted several large printed alphabets in several plain hands. "What are you doing here?" asked My guardian. "Trying to learn myself to read and write," said Krook. "And how do you get on?" "Slow. Bad," returned the old man impatiently. "It's hard at my time of life." "It would be easier to be taught by some one," said My guardian. "Aye, but they might teach me wrong!" returned the old man with a wonderfully suspicious flash of the old man eye. "I don't know what I may have lost by not being learned afore. I wouldn't like to lose anything by being learned wrong now." "Wrong?" said my guardian with the old man good-humoured smile. "Who do you suppose would teach you wrong?" "I don't know, a Jarndyce!" replied the old man, turning up the old man spectacles on the old man forehead and rubbing the old man hands. "I don't suppose as anybody would, but I'd rather trust my own self than another!" These answers and his manner were strange enough to cause My guardian to inquire of Only Mr. Woodcourt, as we all walked across Lincoln's Inn together, whether Krook were really, as Krook lodger represented Krook, deranged. The young surgeon replied, no, The young surgeon had seen no reason to think so. The young surgeon was exceedingly distrustful, as ignorance usually was, and The young surgeon was always more or less under the influence of raw gin, of which The young surgeon drank great quantities and of which The young surgeon and The young surgeon back-shop, as we might have observed, smelt strongly; but The young surgeon did not think The young surgeon mad as yet. On we way home, I so conciliated Peepy's affections by buying The young surgeon a windmill and two flour-sacks that The young surgeon would suffer nobody else to take off The young surgeon hat and gloves and would sit nowhere at dinner but at my side. Caddy sat upon the other side of Caddy, next to Ada, to whom we imparted the whole history of the engagement as soon as we got back. we made much of Caddy, and Peepy too; and Caddy brightened exceedingly; and My guardian was as merry as we were; and we were all very happy indeed until Caddy went home at night in a hackney- coach, with Peepy fast asleep, but holding tight to the windmill. I have forgotten to mention--at least I have not mentioned--that Only Mr. Woodcourt was the same dark young surgeon whom we had met at Mr. Badger's. Or that a Jarndyce invited a Jarndyce to dinner that day. Or that a Jarndyce came. Or that when they were all gone and I said to Ada, "Now, my darling, let we have a little talk about Richard!" Ada laughed and said-- But I don't think it matters what my darling said. Ada was always merry.
