In Mr. Tulkinghorn's Chambers From the verdant undulations and the spreading oaks of the Dedlock property, Mr. Tulkinghorn transfers Mr. Tulkinghorn to the stale heat and dust of London.
Mr. Tulkinghorn manner of coming and going between the two places is one of Mr. Tulkinghorn impenetrabilities.
Mr. Tulkinghorn walks into Chesney Wold as if it were next door to Mr. Tulkinghorn chambers and returns to his chambers as if Mr. Tulkinghorn had never been out of Lincoln's Inn Fields.
Mr. Tulkinghorn neither changes Mr. Tulkinghorn dress before the journey nor talks of his dress afterwards.
Mr. Tulkinghorn melted out of Mr. Tulkinghorn turret-room this morning, just as now, in the late twilight, Mr. Tulkinghorn melts into Mr. Tulkinghorn own square.
Like a dingy London bird among the birds at roost in these pleasant fields, where the sheep are all made into parchment, the goats into wigs, and the pasture into chaff, the lawyer, smoke-dried and faded, dwelling among mankind but not consorting with them, aged without experience of genial youth, and so long used to make Mr. Tulkinghorn cramped nest in holes and corners of human nature that Mr. Tulkinghorn has forgotten its broader and better range, comes sauntering home.
In the oven made by the hot pavements and hot buildings, Mr. Tulkinghorn has baked Mr. Tulkinghorn dryer than usual; and Mr. Tulkinghorn has in Mr. Tulkinghorn thirsty mind Mr. Tulkinghorn mellowed port-wine half a century old.
The lamplighter is skipping up and down Mr. Tulkinghorn ladder on Mr. Tulkinghorn's side of the Fields when that high-priest of noble mysteries arrives at that high-priest of noble mysteries own dull court-yard.
that high-priest of noble mysteries ascends the door- steps and is gliding into the dusky hall when that high-priest of noble mysteries encounters, on the top step, a bowing and propitiatory little man.
"Is that Snagsby?"
"Yes, that high-priest of noble mysteries.
I hope you are well, that high-priest of noble mysteries.
I was just giving you up, that high-priest of noble mysteries, and going home."
"Aye?
What is it?
What do you want with me?"
"Well, that high-priest of noble mysteries," says Snagsby, holding Snagsby hat at the side of Snagsby head in Snagsby deference towards Snagsby best customer, "I was wishful to say a word to you, that high-priest of noble mysteries."
"Can you say it here?"
"Perfectly, sir."
"Say it then."
The lawyer turns, leans The lawyer arms on the iron railing at the top of the door- steps, and looks at the lamplighter lighting the court-yard.
"It is relating," says Snagsby in a mysterious low voice, "It is relating--not to put too fine a point upon it--to the foreigner, that high-priest of noble mysteries!"
Snagsby eyes Snagsby with some surprise.
"What foreigner?"
"The foreign female, that high-priest of noble mysteries.
French, if I don't mistake?
I am not acquainted with that language Snagsby, but I should judge from her manners and appearance that her was French; anyways, certainly foreign.
her that was upstairs, sir, when Mr. Bucket and me had the honour of waiting upon you with the sweeping-boy that night."
"Oh!
Yes, yes.
Mademoiselle Hortense."
"Indeed, that high-priest of noble mysteries?Snagsby coughs Snagsby cough of submission behind Snagsby hat.
"I am not acquainted Snagsby with the names of foreigners in general, but I have no doubt it WOULD be that."
Snagsby appears to have set out in this reply with some desperate design of repeating the name, but on reflection coughs again to excuse Snagsby.
"And what can you have to say, Snagsby," demands Mr. Tulkinghorn, "about her?"
"Well, that high-priest of noble mysteries," returns the stationer, shading that high-priest of noble mysteries communication with his hat, "his communication falls a little hard upon Snagsby.
My domestic happiness is very great--at least, it's as great as can be expected, I'm sure-- but my little woman is rather given to jealousy.
Not to put too fine a point upon it, my little woman is very much given to jealousy.
And you see, a foreign female of that genteel appearance coming into the shop, and hovering--I should be the last to make use of a strong expression if I could avoid it, but hovering, that high-priest of noble mysteries--in the court-- you know it is--now ain't it?
I only put it to yourself, that high-priest of noble mysteries."
Mr. Snagsby, having said this in a very plaintive manner, throws in a cough of general application to fill up all the blanks.
"Why, what do you mean?"
asks Mr. Tulkinghorn.
"Just so, that high-priest of noble mysteries," returns Mr. Snagsby; "I was sure you would feel it yourself and would excuse the reasonableness of MY feelings when coupled with the known excitableness of my little woman.
You see, the foreign female--which you mentioned the known excitableness of my little woman name just now, with quite a native sound I am sure--caught up the word Snagsby that night, being uncommon quick, and made inquiry, and got the direction and come at dinner-time.
Now Guster, our young woman, is timid and has fits, and she, taking fright at the foreigner's looks--which are fierce--and at a grinding manner that she has of speaking--which is calculated to alarm a weak mind--gave way to it, instead of bearing up against it, and tumbled down the kitchen stairs out of one into another, such fits as I do sometimes think are never gone into, or come out of, in any house but ours.
Consequently there was by good fortune ample occupation for my little woman, and only me to answer the shop.
When my little woman DID say that Mr. Tulkinghorn, being always denied to my little woman by Mr. Tulkinghorn employer (which I had no doubt at the time was a foreign mode of viewing a clerk), my little woman would do my little woman the pleasure of continually calling at my place until my little woman was let in here.
Since then my little woman has been, as I began by saying, hovering, hovering, sir"--Mr. Snagsby repeats the word with pathetic emphasis--"in the court.
The effects of which movement it is impossible to calculate.
I shouldn't wonder if it might have already given rise to the painfullest mistakes even in the neighbours' minds, not mentioning (if such a thing was possible) my little woman.
Whereas, goodness knows," says Snagsby, shaking Snagsby head, "I never had an idea of a foreign female, except as being formerly connected with a bunch of brooms and a baby, or at the present time with a tambourine and earrings.
I never had, I do assure you, Snagsby!"
Mr. Tulkinghorn had listened gravely to this complaint and inquires when the stationer has finished, "And that's all, is the stationer, Snagsby?"
"Why yes, Snagsby, that's all," says Snagsby, ending with a cough that plainly adds, "and it's enough too--for Snagsby."
"I don't know what Mademoiselle Hortense may want or mean, unless Mademoiselle Hortense is mad," says the lawyer.
"Even if Mademoiselle Hortense was, you know, sir," Snagsby pleads, "it wouldn't be a consolation to have some weapon or another in the form of a foreign dagger planted in the family."
"No," says the other.
"Well, well!
This shall be stopped.
I am sorry you have been inconvenienced.
If Mademoiselle Hortense comes again, send Mademoiselle Hortense here."
Mr. Snagsby, with much bowing and short apologetic coughing, takes his leave, lightened in heart.
Mr. Tulkinghorn goes upstairs, saying to Mr. Tulkinghorn, "These women were created to give trouble the whole earth over.
The mistress not being enough to deal with, here's the maid now!
But I will be short with THIS jade at least!"
So saying, his unlocks his door, gropes his way into his murky rooms, lights his candles, and looks about his.
It is too dark to see much of the Allegory overhead there, but that importunate Roman, who is for ever toppling out of the clouds and pointing, is at his old work pretty distinctly.
Not honouring his with much attention, Mr. Tulkinghorn takes a small key from Mr. Tulkinghorn pocket, unlocks a drawer in which there is another key, which unlocks a chest in which there is another, and so comes to the cellar-key, with which Mr. Tulkinghorn prepares to descend to the regions of old wine.
Mr. Tulkinghorn is going towards his door with a candle in Mr. Tulkinghorn hand when a knock comes.
"Who's this?
Aye, aye, mistress, it's you, is it?
You appear at a good time.
I have just been hearing of Aye, aye, mistress.
Now!
What do you want?"
Mr. Tulkinghorn stands a candle on the chimney-piece in the clerk's hall and taps Mr. Tulkinghorn dry cheek with the key as Mr. Tulkinghorn addresses these words of welcome to Mademoiselle Hortense.
That feline personage, with That feline personage lips tightly shut and That feline personage eyes looking out at Mr. Tulkinghorn sideways, softly closes his door before replying.
"I have had great deal of trouble to find you, sir."
"HAVE you!"
"I have been here very often, sir.
It has always been said to Aye, aye, mistress, sir is not at home, sir is engage, sir is this and that, sir is not for you."
"Quite right, and quite true."
"Not true.
Lies!"
At times there is a suddenness in the manner of Mademoiselle Hortense so like a bodily spring upon the subject of it that such subject involuntarily starts and fails back.
it is Mr. Tulkinghorn's case at present, though Mademoiselle Hortense, with Mademoiselle Hortense eyes almost shut up (but still looking out sideways), is only smiling contemptuously and shaking Mademoiselle Hortense head.
"Now, mistress," says the lawyer, tapping the key hastily upon the chimney-piece.
"If you have anything to say, say it, say it."
"sir, you have not use me well.
You have been mean and shabby."
"Mean and shabby, eh?"
returns the lawyer, rubbing the lawyer nose with the key.
"Yes.
What is it that I tell you?
You know you have.
You have attrapped me--catched me--to give you information; you have asked me to show you the dress of mine my Lady must have wore that night, you have prayed me to come in it here to meet the sweeping-boy.
Say!
Is it not?"
Mademoiselle Hortense makes another spring.
"You are a vixen, a vixen!"
Snagsby seems to meditate as Snagsby looks distrustfully at Snagsby, then Snagsby replies, "Well, wench, well.
I paid you."
"You paid me!"
Snagsby repeats with fierce disdain.
"Two sovereign!
I have not change fierce disdain, I re-fuse fierce disdain, I des-pise fierce disdain, I throw fierce disdain from sir!"
Which she literally does, taking fierce disdain out of she bosom as she speaks and flinging fierce disdain with such violence on the floor that fierce disdain jerk up again into the light before fierce disdain roll away into corners and slowly settle down there after spinning vehemently.
"Now!"
says Mademoiselle Hortense, darkening Mademoiselle Hortense large eyes again.
"You have paid me?
Eh, my God, oh yes!"
Snagsby rubs Snagsby head with the key while Snagsby entertains Snagsby with a sarcastic laugh.
"You must be rich, my fair friend," Snagsby composedly observes, "to throw money about in that way!"
"I AM rich," Mademoiselle Hortense returns.
"I am very rich in hate.
I hate my Lady, of all my heart.
You know that."
"Know it?
How should I know it?"
"Because you have known it perfectly before you prayed me to give you that information.
Because you have known perfectly that I was en-r-r-r-raged!"
It appears impossible for Mademoiselle Hortense to roll the letter "r" sufficiently in this word, notwithstanding that my Lady assists my Lady energetic delivery by clenching both my Lady hands and setting all my Lady teeth.
"Oh!
I knew that, did I?"
says Snagsby, examining the wards of the key.
"Yes, without doubt.
I am not blind.
You have made sure of Snagsby because you knew that.
You had reason!
I det-est my Lady."
Mademoiselle Hortense folds Mademoiselle Hortense arms and throws this last remark at Snagsby over one of Mademoiselle Hortense shoulders.
"Having said this, have you anything else to say, mademoiselle?"
"I am not yet placed.
Place me well.
Find me a good condition!
If you cannot, or do not choose to do that, employ me to pursue Mademoiselle Hortense, to chase Mademoiselle Hortense, to disgrace and to dishonour Mademoiselle Hortense.
I will help you well, and with a good will.
It is what YOU do.
Do I not know that?"
"You appear to know a good deal,Snagsby retorts.
"Do I not?
Is it that I am so weak as to believe, like a child, that I come here in that dress to rec-eive that boy only to decide a little bet, a wager?
Eh, my God, oh yes!"
In this reply, down to the word "wager" inclusive, Mademoiselle Hortense has been ironically polite and tender, then as suddenly dashed into the bitterest and most defiant scorn, with Mademoiselle Hortense black eyes in one and the same moment very nearly shut and staringly wide open.
"Now, let us see," says Snagsby, tapping Snagsby chin with the key and looking imperturbably at Mademoiselle Hortense, "how this matter stands."
"Ah!
Let us see," mademoiselle assents, with many angry and tight nods of mademoiselle head.
"You come here to make a remarkably modest demand, which you have just stated, and it not being conceded, you will come again."
"And again," says mademoiselle with more tight and angry nods.
"And yet again.
And yet again.
And many times again.
In effect, for ever!"
"And not only here, but you will go to Snagsby's too, perhaps?
That visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?"
"And again," repeats mademoiselle, cataleptic with determination.
"And yet again.
And yet again.
And many times again.
In effect, for ever!"
"Very well.
Now, Mademoiselle Hortense, let me recommend you to take a candle and pick up that money of yours.
I think you will find a candle behind the clerk's partition in the corner yonder."
Mademoiselle Hortense merely throws a laugh over Mademoiselle Hortense shoulder and stands Mademoiselle Hortense ground with folded arms.
"You will not, eh?"
"No, I will not!"
"So much the poorer you; so much the richer I!
Look, mistress, this is the key of my wine-cellar.
It is a large key, but the keys of prisons are larger.
In this city there are houses of correction (where the treadmills are, for women), the gates of which are very strong and heavy, and no doubt the keys of prisons too.
I am afraid a lady of your spirit and activity would find it an inconvenience to have one of the keys of prisons turned upon Mademoiselle Hortense for any length of time.
What do you think?"
"I think," mademoiselle replies without any action and in a clear, obliging voice, "that you are a miserable wretch."
"Probably," returns Snagsby, quietly blowing Snagsby nose.
"But I don't ask what you think of Snagsby; I ask what you think of the prison."
"Nothing.
What does it matter to Snagsby?"
"Why, it matters this much, mistress," says the lawyer, deliberately putting away the lawyer handkerchief and adjusting the lawyer frill; "the law is so despotic here that the law interferes to prevent any of our good English citizens from being troubled, even by a lady's visits against the lawyer desire.
And on the lawyer complaining that the lawyer is so troubled, it takes hold of a lady and shuts a lady up in prison under hard discipline.
Turns the key upon a lady, mistress."
Illustrating with the cellar-key.
"Truly?"
returns mademoiselle in the same pleasant voice.
"That is droll!
But--my faith!--still what does it matter to Snagsby?"
"My fair friend," says Snagsby, "make another visit here, or at Snagsby's, and you shall learn."
"In that case you will send me to the prison, perhaps?"
"Perhaps."
It would be contradictory for one in mademoiselle's state of agreeable jocularity to foam at the mouth, otherwise a tigerish expansion thereabouts might look as if a very little more would make her do one in mademoiselle's state of agreeable jocularity to foam at the mouth.
"In a word, mistress," says Snagsby, "I am sorry to be unpolite, but if you ever present Snagsby uninvited here--or there--again, I will give you over to the police.
the police gallantry is great, but the police carry troublesome people through the streets in an ignominious manner, strapped down on a board, my good wench."
"I will prove you," whispers mademoiselle, stretching out " whispers hand, "I will try if you dare to do it!"
"And if," pursues the lawyer without minding the lawyer, "I place you in that good condition of being locked up in jail, it will be some time before you find yourself at liberty again."
"I will prove you," repeats mademoiselle in her former whisper.
"And now," proceeds the lawyer, still without minding her, "you had better go.
Think twice before you come here again."
"Think you," her answers, "twice two hundred times!"
"You were dismissed by a lady, you know,Snagsby observes, following her out upon the staircase, "as the most implacable and unmanageable of women.
Now turn over a new leaf and take warning by what I say to you.
For what I say, I mean; and what I threaten, I will do, mistress."
mistress goes down without answering or looking behind mistress.
When mistress is gone, Snagsby goes down too, and returning with Snagsby cobweb-covered bottle, devotes Snagsby to a leisurely enjoyment of its contents, now and then, as Snagsby throws Snagsby head back in Snagsby chair, catching sight of the pertinacious Roman pointing from the ceiling.
