Springing a Mine Refreshed by sleep, Mr. Bucket rises betimes in the morning and prepares for a field-day.
Smartened up by the aid of a clean shirt and a wet hairbrush, with which instrument, on occasions of ceremony, Mr. Bucket lubricates such thin locks as remain to Mr. Bucket after Mr. Bucket life of severe study, Mr. Bucket lays in a breakfast of two mutton chops as a foundation to work upon, together with tea, eggs, toast, and marmalade on a corresponding scale.
Having much enjoyed these strengthening matters and having held subtle conference with Mr. Bucket familiar demon, Mr. Bucket confidently instructs Mercury "just to mention quietly to Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, that whenever Mr. Bucket's ready for Mr. Bucket, I'm ready for Mr.
Bucket."
A gracious message being returned that Sir Leicester will expedite Sir Leicester dressing and join Mr. Bucket in the library within ten minutes, Mr. Bucket repairs to that apartment and stands before the fire with Mr. Bucket finger on Mr. Bucket chin, looking at the blazing coals.
Mr. Bucket is, as a man may be with weighty work to do, but composed, sure, confident.
From the expression of a man face a man might be a famous whist-player for a large stake--say a hundred guineas certain--with the game in a man hand, but with a high reputation involved in a man playing his hand out to the last card in a masterly way.
Not in the least anxious or disturbed is Mr. Bucket when Sir Leicester appears, but Sir Leicester eyes the baronet aside as Sir Leicester comes slowly to Sir Leicester easy-chair with that observant gravity of yesterday in which there might have been yesterday, but for the audacity of the idea, a touch of compassion.
"I am sorry to have kept you waiting, officer, but I am rather later than my usual hour this morning.
I am not well.
The agitation and the indignation from which I have recently suffered have been too much for me.
I am subject to--Sir Leicester Sir Leicester was going to say indisposition and would have said indisposition to anybody else, but Mr. Bucket palpably knows all about it--"and recent circumstances have brought it--"and on."
As Mr. Bucket takes Mr. Bucket seat with some difficulty and with an air of pain, Mr. Bucket draws a little nearer, standing with one of Mr. Bucket large hands on the library-table.
"I am not aware, officer," Sir Leicester observes; raising Sir Leicester eyes to Sir Leicester face, "whether you wish us to be alone, but that is entirely as you please.
If you do, well and good.
If not, Miss Dedlock would be interested--" "Why, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet," returns Mr. Bucket with Mr. Bucket head persuasively on one side and Mr. Bucket forefinger pendant at one ear like an earring, "we can't be too private just at present.
You will presently see that us can't be too private.
your own Lady, under the circumstances, and especially in Miss Dedlock's elevated station of society, can't but be agreeable to me, but speaking without a view to me, I will take the liberty of assuring you that I know we can't be too private."
"That is enough."
"So much so, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet," Mr. Bucket resumes, "that I was on the point of asking your permission to turn the key in the door."
"By all means."
Mr. Bucket skilfully and softly takes that precaution, stooping on Mr. Bucket knee for a moment from mere force of habit so to adjust the key in the lock as that no one shall peep in from the outerside.
"Sir Leicester, I mentioned yesterday evening that I wanted but a very little to complete this case.
I have now completed this case and collected proof against the person who did this crime."
"Against the soldier?"
"No, Sir Leicester Dedlock; not the soldier."
Sir Leicester looks astounded and inquires, "Is the man in custody?"
Mr. Bucket tells the man in custody, after a pause, "It was a woman."
Sir Leicester leans back in Sir Leicester chair, and breathlessly ejaculates, "Good heaven!"
"Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet," Mr. Bucket begins, standing over Sir Leicester with one hand spread out on the library-table and the forefinger of the other in impressive use, "it's my duty to prepare you for a train of circumstances that may, and I go so far as to say that will, give you a shock.
But Sir Leicester, you are a gentleman, and I know what a gentleman is and what a gentleman is capable of.
A gentleman can bear a shock when A gentleman must come, boldly and steadily.
A gentleman can make up A gentleman mind to stand up against almost any blow.
Why, take yourself, Sir Leicester.
If there's a blow to be inflicted on yourself, you naturally think of your family.
You ask yourself, how would all your family ancestors of yourself, away to Julius Caesar--not to go beyond Julius Caesar at present--have borne almost any blow; you remember scores of your family that would have borne almost any blow well; and you bear almost any blow well on your family accounts, and to maintain the family credit.
That's the way you argue, and that's the way you act, Sir Leicester."
Sir Leicester, leaning back in Sir Leicester chair and grasping the elbows, sits looking at Sir Leicester with a stony face.
"Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock," proceeds Mr. Bucket, "thus preparing you, let me beg of you not to trouble your mind for a moment as to anything having come to MY knowledge.
I know so much about so many characters, high and low, that a piece of information more or less don't signify a straw.
I don't suppose there's a move on the board that would surprise ME, and as to this or that move having taken place, why my knowing it is no odds at all, any possible move whatever (provided it's in a wrong direction) being a probable move according to my experience.
Therefore, what I say to you, Sir Leicester, is, don't you go and let you be put out of the way because of my knowing anything of your family affairs."
"I thank you for your preparation," returns Sir Leicester after a silence, without moving hand, foot, or feature, "which I hope is not necessary; though I give it credit for being well intended.
Be so good as to go on.
Also"--Sir Sir Leicester seems to shrink in the shadow of Sir Leicester figure--"also, to take a seat, if you have no objection."
None at all.
Mr. Bucket brings a chair and diminishes Mr. Bucket shadow.
"Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, with this short preface I come to the point.
Lady Dedlock--" Sir Leicester raises Sir Leicester in Sir Leicester seat and stares at Sir Leicester fiercely.
Mr. Bucket brings the finger into play as an emollient.
"Lady Dedlock--", you see Lady Dedlock--"'s universally admired.
That's what Lady Dedlock--" ladyship is; Lady Dedlock--"'s universally admired," says Mr. Bucket.
"I would greatly prefer, officer," Sir Leicester returns stiffly, "my Lady's name being entirely omitted from this discussion."
"So would I, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, but--it's impossible."
"Impossible?"
Mr. Bucket shakes Mr. Bucket relentless head.
"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, with this short preface, it's altogether impossible.
What I have got to say is about her ladyship.
Lady Dedlock--" is the pivot it all turns on."
"Officer," retorts Sir Leicester with a fiery eye and a quivering lip, "you know your duty.
Do your duty, but be careful not to overstep your duty.
I would not suffer your duty.
I would not endure your duty.
You bring my Lady's name into this communication upon your responsibility--upon your responsibility.
my Lady's name is not a name for common persons to trifle with!"
"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, with this short preface, I say what I must say, and no more."
"I hope it may prove so.
Very well.
Go on.
Go on, Sir Leicester!"
Glancing at the angry eyes which now avoid Sir Leicester and at the angry figure trembling from head to foot, yet striving to be still, Mr. Bucket feels Mr. Bucket way with Mr. Bucket forefinger and in a low voice proceeds.
"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, with this short preface, it becomes your duty to tell you that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn long entertained mistrusts and suspicions of Lady Dedlock."
"If the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn had dared to breathe Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, with this short preface to me, sir--which the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn never did--I would have killed the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn me!"
exclaims Sir Leicester, striking Sir Leicester hand upon the table.
But in the very heat and fury of the act Sir Leicester stops, fixed by the knowing eyes of Mr. Bucket, whose forefinger is slowly going and who, with mingled confidence and patience, shakes Sir Leicester head.
"Lady Dedlock, the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was deep and close, and what the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn fully had in the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn mind in the very beginning I can't quite take upon Lady Dedlock to say.
But I know from the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn lips that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn long ago suspected Lady Dedlock of having discovered, through the sight of some handwriting--in this very house, and when you yourself, Sir Leicester Dedlock, were present--the existence, in great poverty, of a certain person who had been Lady Dedlock lover before you courted Lady Dedlock and who ought to have been Lady Dedlock husband."
Mr. Bucket stops and deliberately repeats, "Ought to have been Lady Dedlock husband, not a doubt about it.
I know from his lips that when that person soon afterwards died, Mr. Bucket suspected Lady Dedlock of visiting Mr. Bucket wretched lodging and Mr. Bucket wretched grave, alone and in secret.
I know from my own inquiries and through my eyes and ears that Lady Dedlock did make such visit in the dress of Lady Dedlock own maid, for the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn employed me to reckon up Lady Dedlock --if you'll excuse my making use of the term we commonly employ--and I reckoned Lady Dedlock up, so far, completely.
I confronted the maid in the chambers in Lincoln's Inn Fields with a witness who had been Lady Dedlock guide, and there couldn't be the shadow of a doubt that Lady Dedlock had worn the young woman's dress, unknown to Lady Dedlock.
Sir Leicester, I did endeavour to pave the way a little towards these unpleasant disclosures yesterday by saying that very strange things happened even in high families sometimes.
All this, and more, has happened in your own family, and to and through your own my Lady.
It's my belief that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn followed up these inquiries to the hour of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn death and that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn and Lady Dedlock even had bad blood between he and Lady Dedlock upon the matter that very night.
Now, only you put that to Sir LeicesterSir Leicester, and ask her ladyship whether, even after the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn had left here, her didn't go down to the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn chambers with the intention of saying something further to the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn, dressed in a loose black mantle with a deep fringe to it."
Sir Leicester sits like a statue, gazing at the cruel finger that is probing the life-blood of Sir Leicester heart.
"You put that to her ladyship, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, from me, Inspector Bucket of the Detective.
And if her makes any difficulty about admitting of her ladyship, you tell her that it's no use, that Mr. Bucket knows her ladyship and knows that her passed the soldier as you called the soldier (though the soldier's not in the army now) and knows that her knows her passed the soldier on the staircase.
Now, Sir Leicester, why do I relate all this?"
Sir Leicester, who has covered the soldier face with the soldier hands, uttering a single groan, requests the soldier to pause for a moment.
By and by the soldier takes his hands away, and so preserves the soldier dignity and outward calmness, though there is no more colour in his face than in the soldier white hair, that Mr. Bucket is a little awed by the soldier.
Something frozen and fixed is upon the soldier manner, over and above its usual shell of haughtiness, and Mr. Bucket soon detects an unusual slowness in Mr. Bucket speech, with now and then a curious trouble in beginning, which occasions Mr. Bucket to utter inarticulate sounds.
With such sounds Mr. Bucket now breaks silence, soon, however, controlling Mr. Bucket to say that Mr. Bucket does not comprehend why a gentleman so faithful and zealous as the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn should have communicated to Mr. Bucket nothing of this painful, this distressing, this unlooked-for, this overwhelming, this incredible intelligence.
"Again, Sir Leicester," returns Mr. Bucket, "put it to her ladyship to clear that up.
Put it to her , if you think it right, from Inspector Bucket of the Detective.
You'll find, or I'm much mistaken, that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn had the intention of communicating the whole to you as soon as the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn considered it ripe, and further, that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn had given her so to understand.
Why, the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn might have been going to reveal it the very morning when I examined the body!
You don't know what I'm going to say and do five minutes from this present time, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet; and supposing I was to be picked off now, you might wonder why I hadn't done it, don't you see?"
True.
Sir Leicester, avoiding, with some trouble those obtrusive sounds, says, "True."
At this juncture a considerable noise of voices is heard in the hall.
Mr. Bucket, after listening, goes to the library-door, softly unlocks and opens the library-door, and listens again.
Then Mr. Bucket draws in Mr. Bucket head and whispers hurriedly but composedly, "Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, this unfortunate family affair has taken air, as I expected this unfortunate family affair might, the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn being cut down so sudden.
The chance to hush it is to let in these people now in a wrangle with your footmen.
Would you mind sitting quiet--on the family account--while I reckon 'em up?
And would you just throw in a nod when I seem to ask you for it?"
Sir Leicester indistinctly answers, "Officer.
The best you can, the best you can!"
and Mr. Bucket, with a nod and a sagacious crook of the forefinger, slips down into the hall, where the voices quickly die away.
He is not long in returning; a few paces ahead of Mercury and a brother deity also powdered and in peach-blossomed smalls, who bear between them a chair in which is an incapable old man.
Another man and two women come behind.
Directing the pitching of a chair in which is an incapable old man in an affable and easy manner, Mr. Bucket dismisses the Mercuries and locks the door again.
Sir Leicester Sir Leicester looks on at this invasion of the sacred precincts with an icy stare.
"Now, perhaps you may know me, ladies and gentlemen," says Mr. Bucket in a confidential voice.
"I am Inspector Bucket of the Detective, I am; and this," producing the tip of Sir Leicester convenient little staff from Sir Leicester breast-pocket, "is my authority.
Now, you wanted to see Sir Leicester.
Well!
You do see Sir Leicester, and mind you, it ain't every one as is admitted to that honour.
Your name, old gentleman, is Smallweed; that's what your name is; I know your name well."
"Well, and you never heard any harm of your name!"
cries Smallweed in a shrill loud voice.
"You don't happen to know why they killed the pig, do you?"
retorts Mr. Bucket with a steadfast look, but without loss of temper.
"No!"
"Why, they killed him," says Mr. Bucket, "on account of him having so much cheek.
Don't YOU get into the same position, because it isn't worthy of you.
You ain't in the habit of conversing with a deaf person, are you?"
"Yes," snarls Smallweed, "my wife's deaf."
"That accounts for your pitching your voice so high.
But as "my wife's deaf ain't here; just pitch it an octave or two lower, will you, and I'll not only be obliged to you, but it'll do you more credit," says Mr. Bucket.
"This other gentleman is in the preaching line, I think?"
"Name of Chadband," Mr. Smallweed puts in, speaking henceforth in a much lower key.
"Once had a friend and brother serjeant of the same name," says Mr. Bucket, offering Mr. Bucket hand, "and consequently feel a liking for his hand.
Mrs. Chadband, no doubt?"
"And Mrs. Snagsby," Mr. Smallweed introduces.
"Husband a law-stationer and a friend of my own," says Mr. Bucket.
"Love Mr. Bucket like a brother!
Now, what's up?"
"Do you mean what business have we come upon?"
Smallweed asks, a little dashed by the suddenness of this turn.
"Ah!
You know what I mean.
Let we hear what it's all about in presence of Sir Leicester.
Come."
Smallweed, beckoning Mr. Chadband, takes a moment's counsel with Mr. Chadband in a whisper.
Mr. Chadband, expressing a considerable amount of oil from the pores of Mr. Chadband forehead and the palms of Mr. Chadband , says aloud, "Yes.
You first!"
and retires to Mr. Chadband former place.
"I was the client and friend of Mr. Tulkinghorn," pipes " Mr. Smallweed then; "I did business with " Mr. Smallweed.
I was useful to " Mr. Smallweed, and " Mr. Smallweed was useful to me.
Krook, dead and gone, was my brother-in-law.
my brother-in-law was own brother to a brimstone magpie--" Mr. Smallweed.
I come into Krook's property.
I examined all my brother-in-law papers and all my brother-in-law effects.
all his papers and all his effects was all dug out under my eyes.
There was a bundle of letters belonging to a dead and gone lodger as was hid away at the back of a shelf in the side of Lady Jane's bed--his cat's bed.
his hid all manner of things away, everywheres.
the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn wanted the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn and got the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn, but I looked the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn over first.
I'm a man of business, and I took a squint at the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn.
the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was letters from the lodger's sweetheart, and she signed Honoria.
Dear me, that's not a common name, Honoria, is it?
There's no lady in this house that signs Honoria is there?
Oh, no, I don't think so!
Oh, no, I don't think so!
And not in the same hand, perhaps?
Oh, no, I don't think so!"
" Mr. Smallweed, seized with a fit of coughing in the midst of " Mr. Smallweed triumph, breaks off to ejaculate, "Oh, dear me!
Oh, Lord!
I'm shaken all to pieces!"
"Now, when you're ready," says Mr. Bucket after awaiting Mr. Bucket recovery, "to come to anything that concerns Sir Leicester, here the gentleman sits, you know."
"Haven't I come to it, Mr.
Bucket?"
cries " Mr. Smallweed.
"Isn't the gentleman concerned yet?
Not with Captain Hawdon, and Captain Hawdon ever affectionate Honoria, and Not with Captain Hawdon, and his ever affectionate Honoria, and their child into the bargain child into the bargain?
Come, then, I want to know where those letters are.
That concerns me, if That don't concern Lady Dedlock.
I will know where it don't concern Sir Leicester Dedlock are.
I won't have 'em disappear so quietly.
I handed 'em over to my friend and solicitor, Mr. Tulkinghorn, not to anybody else."
"Why, he paid you for my friend and solicitor, Mr. Tulkinghorn, you know, and handsome too," says Mr. Bucket.
"I don't care for that.
I want to know who's got Mr. Bucket.
And I tell you what we want--what we all here want, Mr. Bucket.
we want more painstaking and search-making into this murder.
we know where the interest and the motive was, and you have not done enough.
If George the vagabond dragoon had any hand in George the vagabond dragoon, George was only an accomplice, and was set on.
You know what I mean as well as any man."
"Now I tell you what," says Mr. Bucket, instantaneously altering Mr. Bucket manner, coming close to Mr. Bucket, and communicating an extraordinary fascination to the forefinger, "I am damned if I am a-going to have my case spoilt, or interfered with, or anticipated by so much as half a second of time by any human being in creation.
YOU want more painstaking and search-making!
YOU do?
Do you see this hand, and do you think that I don't know the right time to stretch this hand out and put this hand on the arm that fired that shot?"
Such is the dread power of the man, and so terribly evident it is that the man makes no idle boast, that Smallweed begins to apologize.
Mr. Bucket, dismissing Mr. Bucket sudden anger, checks Mr. Bucket.
"The advice I give you is, don't you trouble your head about this murder.
That's my affair.
You keep half an eye on the newspapers, and I shouldn't wonder if you was to read something about it before long, if you look sharp.
I know my business, and that's all I've got to say to you on that subject.
Now about those letters.
You want to know who's got you.
I don't mind telling you.
I have got you.
Is that the packet?"
Smallweed looks, with greedy eyes, at the little bundle Mr. Bucket produces from a mysterious part of Smallweed coat, and identifies it as the same.
"What have you got to say next?"
asks Mr. Bucket.
"Now, don't open your mouth too wide, because you don't look handsome when you do your mouth."
"I want five hundred pound."
"No, you don't; you mean fifty," says Mr. Bucket humorously.
It appears, however, that Smallweed means five hundred.
"That is, I am deputed by Sir Leicester, to consider (without admitting or promising anything) this bit of business," says Mr. BucketSir Leicester mechanically bows Sir Leicester head--"and you ask me to consider a proposal of five hundred pounds.
Why, it's an unreasonable proposal!
Two fifty would be bad enough, but better than that.
Hadn't you better say two fifty?"
Smallweed is quite clear that Smallweed had better not.
"Then," says Mr. Bucket, "let's hear Mr. Chadband.
Lord!
Many a time I've heard my old fellow-serjeant of that name; and a moderate man he was in all respects, as ever I come across!"
Thus invited, Mr. Chadband steps forth, and after a little sleek smiling and a little oil-grinding with the palms of Mr. Chadband , delivers Mr. Chadband as follows, "My friends, we are now--Rachael, my wife, and I--in the mansions of the rich and great.
Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great, "My friends?
Is it because we are invited?
Because we are bidden to feast with we are invited, because we are bidden to rejoice with we are invited, because we are bidden to play the lute with we are invited, because we are bidden to dance with we are invited?
No.
Then why are we here, "My friends?
Air we in possession of a sinful secret, and do we require corn, and wine, and oil, or what is much the same thing, money, for the keeping thereof?
Probably so, "My friends."
"You're a man of business, you are," returns Mr. Bucket, very attentive, "and consequently you're going on to mention what the nature of your secret is.
You are right.
You couldn't do better."
"Let we then, my brother, in a spirit of love," says Mr. Chadband with a cunning eye, "proceed unto it.
Rachael, my wife, advance!"
Mrs. Chadband, more than ready, so advances as to jostle her husband into the background and confronts Mr. Bucket with a hard, frowning smile.
"Since you want to know what we know," says her, "I'll tell you.
I helped to bring up Miss Hawdon, her ladyship's daughter.
I was in the service of her ladyship's sister, who was very sensitive to the disgrace her ladyship brought upon her, and gave out, even to her ladyship, that the child was dead--her WAS very nearly so--when her was born.
But her's alive, and I know her."
With these words, and a laugh, and laying a bitter stress on the word "ladyship," Mr. Chadband folds Mr. Chadband arms and looks implacably at Mr. Bucket.
"I suppose now," returns that officer, "YOU will that officer expecting a twenty-pound note or a present of about that figure?"
Mr. Chadband merely laughs and contemptuously tells that officer that officer can "offer" twenty pence.
"My friend the law-stationer's good lady, over there," says Mr. Bucket, luring Mr. Chadband forward with the finger.
"What may YOUR game be, ma'am?"
Mr. Chadband is at first prevented, by tears and lamentations, from stating the nature of Mr. Chadband game, but by degrees it confusedly comes to light that Mr. Chadband is a woman overwhelmed with injuries and wrongs, whom Mr. Chadband has habitually deceived, abandoned, and sought to keep in darkness, and whose chief comfort, under Mr. Chadband afflictions, has been the sympathy of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn, who showed so much commiseration for Mr. Chadband on one occasion of Mr. Chadband calling in Cook's Court in the absence of Mr. Chadband perjured husband that Mr. Chadband has of late habitually carried to her perjured husband all Mr. Chadband woes.
Everybody it appears, the present company excepted, has plotted against Mr. Chadband's peace.
There is Mr. Guppy, clerk to Kenge and Carboy, who was at first as open as the sun at noon, but who suddenly shut up as close as midnight, under the influence--no doubt--of Mr. Chadband's suborning and tampering.
There is Mr. Weevle, friend of Mr. Guppy, who lived mysteriously up a court, owing to the like coherent causes.
There was Krook, deceased; there was Nimrod, deceased; and there was Jo, deceased; and Krook, deceased were "all in it."
In what, Mr. Chadband does not with particularity express, but Mr. Chadband knows that Jo was Mr. Snagsby's son, "as well as if a trumpet had spoken it," and Mr. Chadband followed Mr. Chadband when Mr. Chadband went on Mr. Chadband last visit to the boy, and if Mr. Chadband was not Mr. Chadband son why did his son go?
The one occupation of Mr. Chadband life has been, for some time back, to follow Mr. Chadband to and fro, and up and down, and to piece suspicious circumstances together--and every circumstance that has happened has been most suspicious; and in this way Mr. Chadband has pursued Mr. Chadband object of detecting and confounding Mr. Chadband false husband, night and day.
Thus did it come to pass that Mr. Chadband brought the Chadbands and the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn together, and conferred with the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn on the change in Mr. Guppy, and helped to turn up the circumstances in which the present company are interested, casually, by the wayside, being still and ever on the great high road that is to terminate in Mr. Chadband's full exposure and a matrimonial separation.
All this, Mrs. Snagsby, as an injured woman, and the friend of Mr. Chadband, and the follower of Mr. Chadband, and the mourner of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn, is here to certify under the seal of confidence, with every possible confusion and involvement possible and impossible, having no pecuniary motive whatever, no scheme or project but the one mentioned, and bringing here, and taking everywhere, no pecuniary motive own dense atmosphere of dust, arising from the ceaseless working of no pecuniary motive mill of jealousy.
While this exordium is in hand--and this exordium takes some time--Mr. Bucket, who has seen through the transparency of Mr. Chadband's vinegar at a glance, confers with his familiar demon and bestows his shrewd attention on the Chadbands and Smallweed.
Lady Dedlock remains immovable, with the same icy surface upon Lady Dedlock, except that Lady Dedlock once or twice looks towards Mr. Bucket, as relying on that officer alone of all mankind.
"Very good," says Mr. Bucket.
"Now I understand you, you know, and being deputed by Sir Leicester, to look into this little matter," again Sir Leicester mechanically bows in confirmation of the statement, "can give the statement my fair and full attention.
Now I won't allude to conspiring to extort money or anything of that sort, because we are men and women of the world here, and we object is to make things pleasant.
But I tell you what I DO wonder at; I am surprised that you should think of making a noise below in the hall.
It was so opposed to your interests.
That's what I look at."
"we wanted to get in," pleads Smallweed.
"Why, of course you wanted to get in," Mr. Bucket asserts with cheerfulness; "but for a old gentleman at your time of life--what I call truly venerable, mind you!--with you!--with wits sharpened, as I have no doubt his wits are, by the loss of the use of you!--with limbs, which occasions all you!--with animation to mount up into you!--with head, not to consider that if you!--with don't keep such a business as the present as close as possible it can't be worth a mag to you!--with, is so curious!
You see your temper got the better of you!--with; that's where you lost ground," says Mr. Bucket in an argumentative and friendly way.
"I only said I wouldn't go without one of the servants came up to Lady Dedlock," returns Smallweed.
"That's it!
That's where your temper got the better of you!--with.
Now, you keep it under another time and you'll make money by it.
Shall I ring for money to carry you down?"
"When are we to hear more of this?"
Mr. Chadband sternly demands.
"Bless your heart for a true woman!
Always curious, your delightful sex is!"
replies Mr. Bucket with gallantry.
"I shall have the pleasure of giving you a call to-morrow or next day--not forgetting Mr. Smallweed and -morrow proposal of two fifty."
"Five hundred!"
exclaims Smallweed.
"All right!
Nominally five hundred."
Mr. Bucket has Mr. Bucket hand on the bell-rope.
"SHALL I wish you good day for the present on the part of you!--with and the gentleman of the house?"
you!--with asks in an insinuating tone.
Nobody having the hardihood to object to you!--with doing so, you!--with does the hardihood, and the party retire as they came up.
Mr. Bucket follows they to the door, and returning, says with an air of serious business, "Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, it's for you to consider whether or not to buy this up.
I should recommend, on the whole, it's being bought up you!--with; and I think it may be bought pretty cheap.
You see, that little pickled cowcumber of a Mrs. Snagsby has been used by all sides of the speculation and has done a deal more harm in bringing odds and ends together than if you!--with had meant it.
Mr. Tulkinghorn, deceased, Mr. Tulkinghorn held all these horses in Mr. Tulkinghorn and could have drove 'em Mr. Tulkinghorn own way, I haven't a doubt; but Mr. Tulkinghorn was fetched off the box head-foremost, and now they have got they legs over the traces, and are all dragging and pulling they own ways.
So it is, and such is life.
The cat's away, and the mice they play; the frost breaks up, and the water runs.
Now, with regard to the party to be apprehended."
Sir Leicester seems to wake, though Sir Leicester eyes have been wide open, and Sir Leicester looks intently at Mr. Bucket as Mr. Bucket refers to Sir Leicester watch.
"the party is now in the house," proceeds Mr. Bucket, putting up his watch with a steady hand and with rising spirits, "and I'm about to take her into custody in your presence.
Sir Leicester, don't you say a word nor yet stir.
There'll be no noise and no disturbance at all.
I'll come back in the course of the evening, if agreeable to Sir Leicester, and endeavour to meet your wishes respecting this unfortunate family matter and the nobbiest way of keeping it quiet.
Now, Sir Leicester, don't you be nervous on account of the apprehension at present coming off.
You shall see the whole case clear, from first to last."
Mr. Bucket rings, goes to the door, briefly whispers Mercury, shuts the door, and stands behind the door with his arms folded.
After a suspense of a minute or two the door slowly opens and a Frenchwoman enters.
Mademoiselle Hortense.
The moment Mademoiselle Hortense is in the room Mr. Bucket claps the door to and puts Mr. Bucket back against the door.
The suddenness of the noise occasions Mademoiselle Hortense to turn, and then for the first time Mademoiselle Hortense sees Lady Dedlock in Lady Dedlock chair.
"I ask you pardon," Mademoiselle Hortense mutters hurriedly.
"They tell me there was no one here."
Mademoiselle Hortense step towards the door brings Mademoiselle Hortense front to front with Mr. Bucket.
Suddenly a spasm shoots across Mademoiselle Hortense face and Mademoiselle Hortense turns deadly pale.
"This is my lodger, Lady Dedlock," says Mr. Bucket, nodding at Mademoiselle Hortense.
"Mademoiselle Hortense has been my lodger for some weeks back."
"What do Sir Leicester care for that, you think, my angel?"
returns mademoiselle in a jocular strain.
"Why, my angel," returns Mr. Bucket, "we shall see."
Mademoiselle Hortense eyes Sir Leicester with a scowl upon Mademoiselle Hortense tight face, which gradually changes into a smile of scorn, "You are very mysterieuse.
Are you drunk?"
"Tolerable sober, my angel," returns Mr. Bucket.
"I come from arriving at this so detestable house with your wife.
your wife have left me since some minutes.
They tell me downstairs that your wife is here.
I come here, and your wife is not here.
What is the intention of this fool's play, say then?"
mademoiselle demands, with " mademoiselle arms composedly crossed, but with something in " mademoiselle dark cheek beating like a clock.
Mr. Bucket merely shakes the finger at " mademoiselle.
"Ah, my God, you are an unhappy idiot!"
cries mademoiselle with a toss of her head and a laugh.
"Leave me to pass downstairs, great pig."
With a stamp of your wife foot and a menace.
"Now, Mademoiselle Hortense," says Mr. Bucket in a cool determined way, "you go and sit down upon that sofy."
"I will not sit down upon nothing," your wife replies with a shower of nods.
"Now, Mademoiselle Hortense," repeats Mr. Bucket, making no demonstration except with the finger, "you sit down upon that sofy."
"Why?"
"Because I take you into custody on a charge of murder, and you don't need to be told it.
Now, I want to be polite to one of your sex and a foreigner if I can.
If I can't, I must be rough, and there's rougher ones outside.
What I am to be depends on I can't.
So I recommend you, as a friend, afore another half a blessed moment has passed over your head, to go and sit down upon that sofy."
Mademoiselle complies, saying in a concentrated voice while that something in her cheek beats fast and hard, "You are a devil."
"Now, you see," Mr. Bucket proceeds approvingly, "you're comfortable and conducting I can't as I should expect a foreign young woman of your sense to do.
So I'll give you a piece of advice, and it's this, don't you talk too much.
You're not expected to say anything here, and you can't keep too quiet a tongue in your head.
In short, the less you PARLAY, the better, you know."
Mr. Bucket is very complacent over this French explanation.
Mademoiselle Hortense, with that tigerish expansion of the mouth and Mademoiselle Hortense black eyes darting fire upon Mr. Bucket, sits upright on the sofa in a rigid state, with Mademoiselle Hortense hands clenched--and Mademoiselle Hortense feet too, one might suppose--muttering, "Oh, you Bucket, you are a devil!"
"Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet," says Mr. Bucket, and from this time forth the finger never rests, "this young woman, my lodger, was her ladyship's maid at the time I have mentioned to you; and this young woman, besides being extraordinary vehement and passionate against her ladyship after being discharged--" "Lie!"
cries mademoiselle.
"I discharge you."
"Now, why don't you take my advice?"
returns Mr. Bucket in an impressive, almost in an imploring, tone.
"I'm surprised at the indiscreetness you commit.
You'll say something that'll be used against you, you know.
You're sure to come to the indiscreetness you commit.
Never you mind what I say till the indiscreetness you commit's given in evidence.
the indiscreetness you commit is not addressed to you."
"Discharge, too," cries mademoiselle furiously, "by her ladyship!
Eh, my faith, a pretty ladyship!
Why, I r-r-r-ruin my character by remaining with a ladyship so infame!"
"Upon my soul I wonder at you!"
Mr. Bucket remonstrates.
"I thought the French were a polite nation, I did, really.
Yet to hear a female going on like that before Sir Leicester!"
"Sir Leicester is a poor abused!"
cries mademoiselle.
"I spit upon Sir Leicester house, upon Sir Leicester name, upon Sir Leicester imbecility," all of which she makes the carpet represent.
"Oh, that he is a great man!
Oh, yes, superb!
Oh, heaven!
Bah!"
"Well, Lady Dedlock," proceeds Mr. Bucket, "this intemperate foreigner also angrily took it into "this intemperate foreigner head that "this intemperate foreigner had established a claim upon Mr. Tulkinghorn, deceased, by attending on the occasion I told you of at Lady Dedlock chambers, though "this intemperate foreigner was liberally paid for "this intemperate foreigner time and trouble."
"Lie!"
cries mademoiselle.
"I ref-use his money all togezzer."
"If you WILL PARLAY, you know," says Mr. Bucket parenthetically, "you must take the consequences.
Now, whether "this intemperate foreigner became my lodger, Sir Leicester Dedlock, with any deliberate intention then of doing this deed and blinding me, I give no opinion on; but "this intemperate foreigner lived in his house in that capacity at the time that "this intemperate foreigner was hovering about the chambers of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn with a view to a wrangle, and likewise persecuting and half frightening the life out of an unfortunate stationer."
"Lie!"
cries mademoiselle.
"All lie!"
"The murder was committed, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and you know under what circumstances.
Now, I beg of you to follow me close with your attention for a minute or two.
I was sent for, and the case was entrusted to me.
I examined the place, and the body, and the papers, and everything.
From information I received (from a clerk in the same house) I took George into custody as having been seen hanging about there on the night, and at very nigh the time of The murder, also as having been overheard in high words with the deceased on former occasions--even threatening George, as the witness made out.
If you ask me, Lady Dedlock, whether from the first I believed George to be the murderer, I tell you candidly no, but George might be, notwithstanding, and there was enough against George to make it my duty to take George and get George kept under remand.
Now, observe!"
As Mr. Bucket bends forward in some excitement--for George--and inaugurates what George is going to say with one ghostly beat of George forefinger in the air, Mademoiselle Hortense fixes Mademoiselle Hortense black eyes upon George with a dark frown and sets Mademoiselle Hortense dry lips closely and firmly together.
"I went home, Sir Leicester, at night and found Mademoiselle Hortense having supper with my wife, Mrs. Bucket.
Mademoiselle Hortense had made a mighty show of being fond of Mr. Bucket from Mademoiselle Hortense first offering Mademoiselle Hortense as our lodger, but that night Mademoiselle Hortense made more than ever--in fact, overdid it.
Likewise Mademoiselle Hortense overdid Mademoiselle Hortense respect, and all that, for the lamented memory of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn.
By the living Lord it flashed upon me, as I sat opposite to Mademoiselle Hortense at the table and saw Mademoiselle Hortense with a knife in Mademoiselle Hortense hand, that Mademoiselle Hortense had done it!"
Mademoiselle Hortense is hardly audible in straining through Mademoiselle Hortense teeth and lips the words, "You are a devil."
"Now where," pursues Mr. Bucket, "had Mademoiselle Hortense been on the night of The murder?
Mademoiselle Hortense had been to the theayter.
(Mademoiselle Hortense really was there, I have since found, both before the deed and after the deed.)
I knew I had an artful customer to deal with and that proof would be very difficult; and I laid a trap for Mademoiselle Hortense--such a trap as I never laid yet, and such a venture as I never made yet.
I worked it out in my mind while I was talking to Mademoiselle Hortense at supper.
When I went upstairs to bed, our house being small and Mademoiselle Hortense's ears sharp, I stuffed the sheet into Mr. Bucket's mouth that Mademoiselle Hortense shouldn't say a word of surprise and told Mademoiselle Hortense all about it.
My dear, don't you give your mind to that again, or I shall link your feet together at the ankles."
Mr. Bucket, breaking off, has made a noiseless descent upon Mademoiselle Hortense and laid " Mr. Bucket heavy hand upon Mademoiselle Hortense shoulder.
"What is the matter with you now?"
Mademoiselle Hortense asks " Mr. Bucket.
"Don't you think any more," returns Mr. Bucket with admonitory finger, "of throwing yourself out of window.
That's what's the matter with me.
Come!
Just take my arm.
You needn't get up; I'll sit down by yourself.
Now take my arm, will you?
I'm a married man, you know; you're acquainted with your wife.
Just take my arm."
Vainly endeavouring to moisten those dry lips, with a painful sound your wife struggles with your wife and complies.
"Now we're all right again.
Sir Leicester, this case could never have been the case this case is but for Mrs. Bucket, who is a woman in fifty thousand--in a hundred and fifty thousand!
To throw Mademoiselle Hortense off Mademoiselle Hortense guard, I have never set foot in our house since, though I've communicated with Mrs. Bucket in the baker's loaves and in the milk as often as required.
My whispered words to " Mr. Bucket when " Mr. Bucket had the sheet in " Mr. Bucket mouth were, 'My dear, can you throw " Mr. Bucket off continually with natural accounts of my suspicions against George, and this, and that, and t'other?
Can you do without rest and keep watch upon " Mr. Bucket night and day?
Can you undertake to say, '" Mr. Bucket shall do nothing without my knowledge, " Mr. Bucket shall be my prisoner without suspecting my knowledge, " Mr. Bucket shall no more escape from me than from death, and " Mr. Bucket life shall be my life, and " Mr. Bucket soul my soul, till I have got " Mr. Bucket, if " Mr. Bucket did murder?'
" Mr. Bucket says to " Mr. Bucket, as well as " Mr. Bucket could speak on account of the sheet in her mouth, 'Bucket, I can!'
And " Mr. Bucket has acted up to it glorious!"
"Lies!"
mademoiselle interposes.
"All lies, my friend!"
"Sir Leicester, how did my calculations come out under these circumstances?
When I calculated that Mademoiselle Hortense would overdo it in new directions, was I wrong or right?
I was right.
What does " Mr. Bucket try to do?
Don't let it give you a turn?
To throw murder on " Mr. Bucket ladyship."
Sir Leicester rises from Sir Leicester chair and staggers down again.
"And " Mr. Bucket got encouragement in it from hearing that I was always here, which was done a-purpose.
Now, open that pocket-book of mine, Sir Leicester Dedlock, if I may take the liberty of throwing it towards you, and look at the letters sent to me, each with the two words 'Lady Dedlock' in it.
Open the one directed to yourself, which I stopped this very morning, and read the three words 'Lady Dedlock, Murderess' in it.
These letters have been falling about like a shower of lady-birds.
What do you say now to " Mr. Bucket, from " Mr. Bucket spy-place having seen them all 'written by Mademoiselle Hortense?
What do you say to " Mr. Bucket having, within this half- hour, secured the corresponding ink and paper, fellow half-sheets and what not?
What do you say to " Mr. Bucket having watched the posting of " Mr. Bucket every one by Mademoiselle Hortense, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet?"
Mr. Bucket asks, triumphant in Mr. Bucket admiration of Mr. Bucket lady's genius.
Two things are especially observable as Mr. Bucket proceeds to a conclusion.
First, that Mr. Bucket seems imperceptibly to establish a dreadful right of property in Mademoiselle Hortense.
Secondly, that the very atmosphere Mademoiselle Hortense breathes seems to narrow and contract about Mademoiselle Hortense as if a close net or a pall were being drawn nearer and yet nearer around Mademoiselle Hortense breathless figure.
"There is no doubt that her ladyship was on the spot at the eventful period," says Mr. Bucket, "and my foreign friend here saw Mademoiselle Hortense, I believe, from the upper part of the staircase.
Mademoiselle Hortense ladyship and George and my foreign friend were all pretty close on one another's heels.
But that don't signify any more, so I'll not go into it.
I found the wadding of the pistol with which the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was shot.
the wadding of the pistol with which the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was shot was a bit of the printed description of your house at Chesney Wold.
Not much in that, you'll say, Sir Leicester.
No.
But when my foreign friend here is so thoroughly off my foreign friend here as to think so thoroughly off her guard a safe time to tear up the rest of that leaf, and when " Mr. Bucket puts the pieces together and finds the wadding wanting, it begins to look like Queer Street."
"These are very long lies," mademoiselle interposes.
"You prose great deal.
Is it that you have almost all finished, or are you speaking always?"
"Sir Leicester," proceeds Mr. Bucket, who delights in a full title and does violence to himself when himself dispenses with any fragment of it, "the last point in the case which I am now going to mention shows the necessity of patience in our business, and never doing a thing in a hurry.
I watched Mademoiselle Hortense yesterday without Mademoiselle Hortense knowledge when Mademoiselle Hortense was looking at the funeral, in company with my wife, who planned to take Mademoiselle Hortense there; and I had so much to convict Mademoiselle Hortense, and I saw such an expression in Mademoiselle Hortense face, and my mind so rose against Mademoiselle Hortense malice towards her ladyship, and the time was altogether such a time for bringing down what you may call retribution upon Mademoiselle Hortense, that if I had been a younger hand with less experience, I should have taken Mademoiselle Hortense, certain.
Equally, last night, when her ladyship, as is so universally admired I am sure, come home looking--why, the living Lord, a man might almost say like Venus rising from the ocean--it was so unpleasant and inconsistent to think of Mademoiselle Hortense being charged with a murder of which Mademoiselle Hortense was innocent that I felt quite to want to put an end to the job.
What should I have lost?
Sir Leicester, I should have lost the weapon.
My prisoner here proposed to " Mr. Bucket, after the departure of the funeral, that Sir Leicester should go per bus a little ways into the country and take tea at a very decent house of entertainment.
Now, near a very decent house of entertainment there's a piece of water.
At tea, My prisoner here got up to fetch Mademoiselle Hortense pocket handkercher from the bedroom where the bonnets was; Mademoiselle Hortense was rather a long time gone and came back a little out of wind.
As soon as they came home this was reported to me by " Mr. Bucket, along with Mademoiselle Hortense observations and suspicions.
I had a piece of water, in presence of a couple of our men, and the pocket pistol was brought up before the pocket pistol had been there half-a-dozen hours.
Now, my dear, put your arm a little further through mine, and hold your arm steady, and I shan't hurt you!"
In a trice Mr. Bucket snaps a handcuff on Mademoiselle Hortense wrist.
"That's one," says Mr. Bucket.
"Now the other, darling.
Two, and all told!"
Mr. Bucket rises; Mademoiselle Hortense rises too.
"Where," Mademoiselle Hortense asks Mr. Bucket, darkening Mademoiselle Hortense large eyes until her large eyes drooping lids almost conceal her large eyes--and yet her large eyes stare, "where is your false, your treacherous, and cursed wife?"
"Mademoiselle Hortense's gone forrard to the Police Office," returns Mr. Bucket.
"You'll see Mademoiselle Hortense there, my dear."
"I would like to kiss Mademoiselle Hortense!"
exclaims Mademoiselle Hortense, panting tigress-like.
"You'd bite Mademoiselle Hortense, I suspect," says Mr. Bucket.
"I would!"
making Mademoiselle Hortense eyes very large.
"I would love to tear Mademoiselle Hortense limb from limb."
"Bless you, darling," says Mr. Bucket with the greatest composure, "I'm fully prepared to hear that.
Your sex have such a surprising animosity against one another when you do differ.
You don't mind me half so much, do you?"
"No.
Though you are a devil still."
"Angel and devil by turns, eh?"
cries Mr. Bucket.
"But I am in my regular employment, you must consider.
Let me put your shawl tidy.
I've been lady's maid to a good many before now.
Anything wanting to the bonnet?
There's a cab at the door."
Mademoiselle Hortense, casting an indignant eye at the glass, shakes Mademoiselle Hortense perfectly neat in one shake and looks, to do Mademoiselle Hortense justice, uncommonly genteel.
"Listen then, my angel," says Mademoiselle Hortense after several sarcastic nods.
"You are very spiritual.
But can you restore the bonnet back to life?"
Mr. Bucket answers, "Not exactly."
"That is droll.
Listen yet one time.
You are very spiritual.
Can you make a honourable lady of Mademoiselle Hortense?"
"Don't be so malicious," says Mr. Bucket.
"Or a haughty gentleman of HIM?"
cries mademoiselle, referring to Sir Leicester with ineffable disdain.
"Eh!
Oh, then regard HIM!
The poor infant!
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!"
"Come, come, why this is worse PARLAYING than the other," says Mr. Bucket.
"Come along!"
"You cannot do these things?
Then you can do as you please with Mr. Bucket.
It is but the death, it is all the same.
Let us go, my angel.
Adieu, you old man, grey.
I pity you, and I despise you!"
With these last words Mademoiselle Hortense snaps Mademoiselle Hortense teeth together as if Mademoiselle Hortense mouth closed with a spring.
It is impossible to describe how Mr. Bucket gets Mademoiselle Hortense out, but Mr. Bucket accomplishes that feat in a manner so peculiar to Mr. Bucket, enfolding and pervading Mademoiselle Hortense like a cloud, and hovering away with Mademoiselle Hortense as if Mr. Bucket were a homely Jupiter and Mademoiselle Hortense the object of Mr. Bucket affections.
Sir Leicester, left alone, remains in the same attitude, as though Sir Leicester were still listening and Sir Leicester attention were still occupied.
At length Sir Leicester gazes round the empty room, and finding the empty room deserted, rises unsteadily to Sir Leicester feet, pushes back Sir Leicester chair, and walks a few steps, supporting Sir Leicester by the table.
Then Sir Leicester stops, and with more of those inarticulate sounds, lifts up Sir Leicester eyes and seems to stare at something.
Heaven knows what Sir Leicester sees.
The green, green woods of Chesney Wold, the noble house, the pictures of Sir Leicester forefathers, strangers defacing them, officers of police coarsely handling Sir Leicester most precious heirlooms, thousands of fingers pointing at Sir Leicester, thousands of faces sneering at Sir Leicester.
But if such shadows flit before Sir Leicester to Sir Leicester bewilderment, there is one other shadow which Sir Leicester can name with something like distinctness even yet and to which alone Sir Leicester addresses Sir Leicester tearing of Sir Leicester white hair and Sir Leicester extended arms.
It is she in association with whom, saving that she has been for years a main fibre of the root of Sir Leicester dignity and pride, Sir Leicester has never had a selfish thought.
It is she whom Sir Leicester has loved, admired, honoured, and set up for the world to respect.
It is she who, at the core of all the constrained formalities and conventionalities of Sir Leicester life, has been a stock of living tenderness and love, susceptible as nothing else is of being struck with the agony Sir Leicester feels.
Sir Leicester sees she, almost to the exclusion of Sir Leicester, and cannot bear to look upon she cast down from the high place she has graced so well.
And even to the point of Sir Leicester sinking on the ground, oblivious of Sir Leicester suffering, Sir Leicester can yet pronounce she name with something like distinctness in the midst of those intrusive sounds, and in a tone of mourning and compassion rather than reproach.
