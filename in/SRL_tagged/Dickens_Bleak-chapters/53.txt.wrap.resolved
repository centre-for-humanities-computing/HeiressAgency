Enlightened When Mr. Woodcourt arrived in London, Mr. Woodcourt went, that very same day, to Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn. For Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn never once, from the moment when I entreated Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn to be a friend to Richard, neglected or forgot Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn promise. Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn had told me that Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn accepted the charge as a sacred trust, and Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn was ever true to he accepted the charge as a sacred trust in that spirit. Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn found Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn in Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn office and informed Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn of Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn agreement with Richard that Richard should call there to learn Richard address. "Just so, sir," said Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn. "his address is not a hundred miles from here, sir, his address is not a hundred miles from here. Would you take a seat, sir?" Mr. Woodcourt thanked Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn, but Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn had no business with Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn beyond what Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn had mentioned. "Just so, sir. I believe, sir," said Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn, still quietly insisting on a seat by not giving his address, "that you have influence with Mr. C. Indeed I am aware that you have." "I was not aware of it myself," returned " Mr. Woodcourt; "but I suppose you know best." "sir," rejoined Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn, self-contained as usual, voice and all, "it is a part of my professional duty to know best. It is a part of my professional duty to study and to understand a gentleman who confides his interests to myself. In my professional duty I shall not be wanting, sir, if I know it. I may, with the best intentions, be wanting in it without knowing it; but not if I know it, sir." " Mr. Woodcourt again mentioned his address. "Give me leave, sir," said Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn. "Bear with Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn for a moment. sir, Mr. C. is playing for a considerable stake, and cannot play without--need I say what?" "Money, I presume?" sir," said Mr. Vholes, "to be honest with you (honesty being my golden rule, whether I gain by it or lose, and I find that I generally lose), money is the word. Now, sir, upon the chances of Mr. C.'s game I express to you no opinion, NO opinion. It might be highly impolitic in Mr. C., after playing so long and so high, to leave off; it might be the reverse; I say nothing. No, sir," said Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn, bringing Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn hand flat down upon Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn desk in a positive manner, "nothing." "You seem to forget," returned " Mr. Woodcourt, "that I ask you to say nothing and have no interest in anything you say." "Pardon me, sir!" retorted Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn. "You do you an injustice. No, sir! Pardon me! You shall not--shall not in my office, if I know it--do you an injustice. You are interested in anything, and in everything, that relates to your friend. I know human nature much better, sir, than to admit for an instant that a gentleman of your appearance is not interested in whatever concerns sir friend." "Well," replied " Mr. Woodcourt, "that may be. I am particularly interested in " Mr. Woodcourt address." "The number, sir," said Mr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn parenthetically, "I believe I have already mentioned. If Mr. C. is to continue to play for this considerable stake, sir, Mr. C. must have funds. Understand me! There are funds in hand at present. I ask for nothing; there are funds in hand. But for the onward play, more funds must be provided, unless Mr. C. is to throw away what Mr. C. has already ventured, which is wholly and solely a point for Mr. C. consideration. This, sir, I take the opportunity of stating openly to sir as the friend of Mr.
