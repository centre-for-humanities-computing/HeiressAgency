Telescopic Philanthropy Telescopic Philanthropy were to pass the night, Mr. Kenge told Telescopic Philanthropy when Telescopic Philanthropy arrived in Mr. Kenge room, at Mrs. Jellyby's; and then Mr. Kenge turned to Mr. Kenge and said Mr. Kenge took it for granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was. "I really don't, Mr. Kenge," I returned. "Perhaps Mr. Carstone--or Miss Clare--" But no, they knew nothing whatever about Mrs. Jellyby. "In-deed! Mrs. Jellyby," said Mr. Kenge, standing with Mr. Kenge back to the fire and casting Mr. Kenge eyes over the dusty hearth-rug as if his eyes were Mrs. Jellyby's biography, "is a lady of very remarkable strength of character who devotes herself entirely to the public. herself has devoted herself to an extensive variety of public subjects at various times and is at present (until something else attracts herself) devoted to the subject of Africa, with a view to the general cultivation of the coffee berry--AND the natives--and the happy settlement, on the banks of the African rivers, of our superabundant home population. Mr. Jarndyce, who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely to be a good work and who is much sought after by philanthropists, has, I believe, a very high opinion of Mrs. Jellyby." Mr. Kenge, adjusting " Mr. Kenge cravat, then looked at our. "And Mr. Jellyby, sir?" suggested Richard. "Ah! Mrs. Jellyby," said " Mr. Kenge, "is--a--I don't know that I can describe " Mr. Kenge to Mrs. Jellyby better than by saying that " Mr. Kenge is the husband of Mrs. Jellyby." "A nonentity, sir?" said Richard with a droll look. "I don't say that," returned " Mr. Kenge gravely. "I can't say that, indeed, for I know nothing whatever OF Mrs. Jellyby. I never, to my knowledge, had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Jellyby. Mrs. Jellyby may be a very superior man, but Mrs. Jellyby is, so to speak, merged--merged--in the more shining qualities of Mrs. Jellyby wife." " Mr. Kenge proceeded to tell our that as the road to Bleak House would have been very long, dark, and tedious on such an evening, and as our had been travelling already, Mr. Jarndyce had Mr. Jarndyce proposed this arrangement. A carriage would be at Mrs. Jellyby's to convey our out of town early in the forenoon of to-morrow. Mr. Jarndyce then rang a little bell, and the young gentleman came in. Addressing Mr. Jarndyce by the name of Guppy, " Mr. Kenge inquired whether Miss Summerson's boxes and the rest of the baggage had been "sent round." Mr. Guppy said yes, they had been sent round, and a coach was waiting to take our round too as soon as our pleased. "Then it only remains," said " Mr. Kenge, shaking hands with our, "for me to express my lively satisfaction in (good day, Miss Clare!) the arrangement this day concluded and my (GOOD-bye to you, Miss Summerson!) lively hope that it will conduce to the happiness, the (glad to have had the honour of making your acquaintance, Mr. Carstone!) welfare, the advantage in all points of view, of all concerned! Guppy, see the party safely there." "Where IS 'there,' Mr. Guppy?" said Richard as our went downstairs. "No distance," said Mr. Guppy; "round in Thavies Inn, you know." "I can't say I know where it is, for I come from Winchester and am strange in London." "Only round the corner," said Mr. Guppy. "our just twist up Chancery Lane, and cut along Holborn, and there our are in four minutes' time, as near as a toucher. This is about a London particular NOW, ain't This, miss?" Mr. Guppy seemed quite delighted with This on my account. "The fog is very dense indeed!" said I. "Not that I. " affects you, though, I'm sure," said Mr. Guppy, putting up the steps. "On the contrary, it seems to do you good, miss, judging from your appearance." I knew Mr. Guppy meant well in paying me this compliment, so I laughed at Mr. Guppy for blushing at this compliment when Mr. Guppy had shut the door and got upon the box; and we all three laughed and chatted about our inexperience and the strangeness of London until our turned up under an archway to our destination--a narrow street of high houses like an oblong cistern to hold the fog. There was a confused little crowd of people, principally children, gathered about the house at which our stopped, which had a tarnished brass plate on the door with the inscription JELLYBY. "Don't be frightened!" said Mr. Guppy, looking in at the coach- window. "One of the young Jellybys been and got Mr. Guppy head through the area railings!" "Oh, poor child," said I; "let me out, if you please!" "Pray be careful of "Oh, poor child, miss. the young Jellybys are always up to something," said Mr. Guppy. I made my way to the poor child, who was one of the dirtiest little unfortunates I ever saw, and found Mr. Guppy very hot and frightened and crying loudly, fixed by the neck between two iron railings, while a milkman and a beadle, with the kindest intentions possible, were endeavouring to drag Mr. Guppy back by the legs, under a general impression that Mr. Guppy skull was compressible by those means. As I found (after pacifying Mr. Guppy) that Mr. Guppy was a little boy with a naturally large head, I thought that perhaps where his head could go, Mr. Guppy body could follow, and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to push Mr. Guppy forward. This was so favourably received by the milkman and beadle that Mr. Guppy would immediately have been pushed into the area if I had not held Mr. Guppy pinafore while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down through the kitchen to catch Mr. Guppy when Mr. Guppy should be released. At last Mr. Guppy was happily got down without any accident, and then Mr. Guppy began to beat Mr. Guppy with a hoop-stick in quite a frantic manner. Nobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in pattens, who had been poking at the child from below with a broom; I don't know with what object, and I don't think the child did. I therefore supposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at home, and was quite surprised when a person in pattens, who had been poking at the child from below with a broom appeared in the passage without the pattens, and going up to the back room on the first floor before Ada and me, announced us as, "Ada and me two young ladies, Missis Jellyby!" us passed several more children on the way up, whom it was difficult to avoid treading on in the dark; and as us came into Mrs. Jellyby's presence, one of the poor little things fell downstairs--down a whole flight (as it sounded to me), with a great noise. Mrs. Jellyby, whose face reflected none of the uneasiness which we could not help showing in us own faces as the dear child's head recorded its passage with a bump on every stair--Richard afterwards said Richard counted seven, besides one for the landing--received us with perfect equanimity. She was a pretty, very diminutive, plump woman of from forty to fifty, with handsome eyes, though they had a curious habit of seeming to look a long way off. As if--I am quoting Richard again--they could see nothing nearer than Africa! "I am very glad indeed," said Mrs. Jellyby in an agreeable voice, "to have the pleasure of receiving you. I have a great respect for Mr. Jarndyce, and no one in whom Mr. Jarndyce is interested can be an object of indifference to me." us expressed us acknowledgments and sat down behind the door, where there was a lame invalid of a sofa. Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair but was too much occupied with Mrs. Jellyby African duties to brush very good hair. The shawl in which Mrs. Jellyby had been loosely muffled dropped onto Mrs. Jellyby chair when Mrs. Jellyby advanced to us; and as Mrs. Jellyby turned to resume Mrs. Jellyby seat, us could not help noticing that Mrs. Jellyby dress didn't nearly meet up the back and that the open space was railed across with a lattice-work of stay-lace--like a summer-house. The room, which was strewn with papers and nearly filled by a great writing-table covered with similar litter, was, I must say, not only very untidy but very dirty. us were obliged to take notice of that with us sense of sight, even while, with us sense of hearing, us followed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs: I think into the back kitchen, where somebody seemed to stifle the poor child who had tumbled downstairs. But what principally struck us was a jaded and unhealthy-looking though by no means plain girl at the writing-table, who sat biting the feather of plain girl pen and staring at us. I suppose nobody ever was in such a state of ink. And from plain girl tumbled hair to plain girl pretty feet, which were disfigured with frayed and broken satin slippers trodden down at heel, plain girl really seemed to have no article of dress upon plain girl, from a pin upwards, that was in no article of dress proper condition or no article of dress right place. "You find me, my dears," said Mrs. Jellyby, snuffing the two great office candles in tin candlesticks, which made the room taste strongly of hot tallow (the fire had gone out, and there was nothing in the grate but ashes, a bundle of wood, and a poker), "you find me, my dears, as usual, very busy; but that you will excuse. The African project at present employs my whole time. The African project at present involves me in correspondence with public bodies and with private individuals anxious for the welfare of private individuals species all over the country. I am happy to say it is advancing. We hope by this time next year to have from a hundred and fifty to two hundred healthy families cultivating coffee and educating the natives of Borrioboola-Gha, on the left bank of the Niger." As Ada said nothing, but looked at me, I said it must be very gratifying. "It IS gratifying," said Mrs. Jellyby. "It involves the devotion of all my energies, such as they are; but that is nothing, so that It succeeds; and I am more confident of success every day. Do you know, Miss Summerson, I almost wonder that YOU never turned your thoughts to Africa." This application of the subject was really so unexpected to me that I was quite at a loss how to receive it. I hinted that the climate-- "The finest climate in the world!" said Mrs. Jellyby. "Indeed, ma'am?" "Certainly. With precaution," said Mrs. Jellyby. "You may go into Holborn, without precaution, and be run over. You may go into Holborn, with precaution, and never be run over. Just so with Africa." I said, "No doubt." I meant as to Holborn. "If you would like," said Mrs. Jellyby, putting a number of papers towards us, "to look over some remarks on that head, and on the general subject, which have been extensively circulated, while I finish a letter I am now dictating to my eldest daughter, who is my amanuensis--" The girl at the table left off biting The girl at the table and made a return to us recognition, which was half bashful and half sulky. "--I shall then have finished for the present," proceeded Mrs. Jellyby with a sweet smile, "though my work is never done. Where are you, Caddy?" "'Presents her compliments to Mr. Swallow, and begs--'" said Caddy. "'And begs,'" said Mrs. Jellyby, dictating, "'to inform Mrs. Jellyby, in reference to Mrs. Jellyby letter of inquiry on the African project--' No, Peepy! Not on my account!" Peepy (so self-named) was the unfortunate child who had fallen downstairs, who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting Peepy (so self-named, with a strip of plaster on Peepy (so self-named forehead, to exhibit Peepy (so self-named wounded knees, in which Ada and I did not know which to pity most-- the bruises or the dirt. Mrs. Jellyby merely added, with the serene composure with which Mrs. Jellyby said everything, "Go along, you naughty Peepy!" and fixed Mrs. Jellyby fine eyes on Africa again. However, as Mrs. Jellyby at once proceeded with Mrs. Jellyby dictation, and as I interrupted nothing by doing it, I ventured quietly to stop poor Peepy as Peepy was going out and to take Peepy up to nurse. Peepy looked very much astonished at it and at Ada's kissing Peepy, but soon fell fast asleep in my arms, sobbing at longer and longer intervals, until Peepy was quiet. I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in detail, though I derived such a general impression from Peepy of the momentous importance of Africa, and the utter insignificance of all other places and things, that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so little about it. "Six o'clock!" said Mrs. Jellyby. "And our dinner hour is nominally (for our dine at all hours) five! Caddy, show Miss Clare and Miss Summerson Miss Clare and Miss Summerson rooms. You will like to make some change, perhaps? You will excuse me, I know, being so much occupied. Oh, that very bad child! Pray put that very bad child down, Miss Summerson!" I begged permission to retain that very bad child, truly saying that that very bad child was not at all troublesome, and carried that very bad child upstairs and laid that very bad child on my bed. Ada and I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between. two upper rooms were excessively bare and disorderly, and the curtain to my window was fastened up with a fork. "You would like some hot water, wouldn't you?" said Mrs. Jellyby, looking round for a jug with a handle to Mrs. Jellyby, but looking in vain. "If it is not being troublesome," said we. "Oh, it's not the trouble," returned Mrs. Jellyby; "the question is, if there IS any." The evening was so very cold and two upper rooms had such a marshy smell that I must confess it was a little miserable, and Ada was half crying. we soon laughed, however, and were busily unpacking when Mrs. Jellyby Mrs. Jellyby came back to say that Mrs. Jellyby was sorry there was no hot water, but she was sorry there was no hot water couldn't find the kettle, and the boiler was out of order. we begged Mrs. Jellyby not to mention it and made all the haste we could to get down to the fire again. But all the little children had come up to the landing outside to look at the phenomenon of Peepy lying on my bed, and we attention was distracted by the constant apparition of noses and fingers in situations of danger between the hinges of the doors. It was impossible to shut the door of either room, for my lock, with no knob to it, looked as if it wanted to be wound up; and though the handle of Ada's went round and round with the greatest smoothness, it was attended with no effect whatever on the door. Therefore I proposed to the children that the children should come in and be very good at my table, and I would tell the children the story of Little Red Riding Hood while I dressed; which the children did, and were as quiet as mice, including Peepy, who awoke opportunely before the appearance of the wolf. When we went downstairs we found a mug with "A Present from Tunbridge Wells" on it lighted up in the staircase window with a floating wick, and a young woman, with a swelled face bound up in a flannel bandage blowing the fire of the drawing-room (now connected by an open door with Mrs. Jellyby's room) and choking dreadfully. It smoked to that degree, in short, that we all sat coughing and crying with the windows open for half an hour, during which Mrs. Jellyby, with the same sweetness of temper, directed letters about Africa. Mrs. Jellyby being so employed was, I must say, a great relief to me, for Richard told we that Richard had washed Richard hands in a pie-dish and that they had found the kettle on Richard dressing-table, and Richard made Ada laugh so that they made me laugh in the most ridiculous manner. Soon after seven o'clock we went down to dinner, carefully, by Mrs. Jellyby's advice, for the stair-carpets, besides being very deficient in stair-wires, were so torn as to be absolute traps. we had a fine cod-fish, a piece of roast beef, a dish of cutlets, and a pudding; an excellent dinner, if a fine cod-fish, a piece of roast beef, a dish of cutlets, and a pudding; an excellent dinner had had any cooking to speak of, but a fine cod-fish, a piece of roast beef, a dish of cutlets, and a pudding; an excellent dinner was almost raw. The young woman with the flannel bandage waited, and dropped everything on the table wherever it happened to go, and never moved it again until The young woman with the flannel bandage put it on the stairs. The person I had seen in pattens, who I suppose to have been the cook, frequently came and skirmished with The young woman with the flannel bandage at the door, and there appeared to be ill will between The person I had seen in pattens, who I suppose to have been the cook. All through dinner--which was long, in consequence of such accidents as the dish of potatoes being mislaid in the coal skuttle and the handle of the corkscrew coming off and striking The young woman with the flannel bandage in the chin--Mrs. Mrs. Jellyby preserved the evenness of Mrs. Jellyby disposition. Mrs. Jellyby told us a great deal that was interesting about Borrioboola-Gha and the natives, and received so many letters that Richard, who sat by Mrs. Jellyby, saw four envelopes in the gravy at once. Some of the letters were proceedings of ladies' committees or resolutions of ladies' meetings, which Mrs. Jellyby read to us; others were applications from people excited in various ways about the cultivation of coffee, and natives; others required answers, and these Mrs. Jellyby sent Mrs. Jellyby eldest daughter from the table three or four times to write. her eldest daughter was full of business and undoubtedly was, as her eldest daughter had told us, devoted to the cause. I was a little curious to know who a mild bald gentleman in spectacles was, who dropped into a vacant chair (there was no top or bottom in particular) after the fish was taken away and seemed passively to submit a mild bald gentleman in spectacles to Borrioboola-Gha but not to be actively interested in that settlement. As a mild bald gentleman in spectacles never spoke a word, a mild bald gentleman in spectacles might have been a native but for a mild bald gentleman in spectacles complexion. It was not until us left the table and a mild bald gentleman in spectacles remained alone with Richard that the possibility of a mild bald gentleman in spectacles being Mrs. Jellyby ever entered my head. But a mild bald gentleman in spectacles WAS Mrs. Jellyby; and a loquacious young man called Mr. Quale, with large shining knobs for temples and a mild bald gentleman in spectacles hair all brushed to the back of a mild bald gentleman in spectacles head, who came in the evening, and told Ada a mild bald gentleman in spectacles was a philanthropist, also informed Ada that a mild bald gentleman in spectacles called the matrimonial alliance of Mrs. Jellyby with Mrs. Jellyby the union of mind and matter. This young man, besides having a great deal to say for This young man about Africa and a project of This young man for teaching the coffee colonists to teach the natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an export trade, delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saving, "I believe now, Mrs. Jellyby, you have received as many as from one hundred and fifty to two hundred letters respecting Africa in a single day, have you not?" or, "If my memory does not deceive me, Mrs. Jellyby, you once mentioned that you had sent off five thousand circulars from one post-office at one time?"--always repeating Mrs. Jellyby's answer to us like an interpreter. During the whole evening, Mrs. Jellyby sat in a corner with Mrs. Jellyby head against the wall as if Mrs. Jellyby were subject to low spirits. It seemed that Mrs. Jellyby had several times opened Mrs. Jellyby mouth when alone with Richard after dinner, as if Mrs. Jellyby had something on Mrs. Jellyby mind, but had always shut his mind again, to Richard's extreme confusion, without saying anything. Mrs. Jellyby, sitting in quite a nest of waste paper, drank coffee all the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter. her eldest daughter also held a discussion with Mr. Quale, of which the subject seemed to be--if I understood the subject--the brotherhood of humanity, and gave utterance to some beautiful sentiments. I was not so attentive an auditor as I might have wished to be, however, for Peepy and the other children came flocking about Ada and me in a corner of the drawing-room to ask for another story; so we sat down among the other children and told the other children in whispers "Puss in Boots" and I don't know what else until Mrs. Jellyby, accidentally remembering the other children, sent the other children to bed. As Peepy cried for me to take Peepy to bed, I carried Peepy upstairs, where the young woman with the flannel bandage charged into the midst of the little family like a dragon and overturned the little family like a dragon into cribs. After that I occupied myself in making we room a little tidy and in coaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn, which at last it did, quite brightly. On my return downstairs, I felt that Mrs. Jellyby looked down upon myself rather for being so frivolous, and I was sorry for it, though at the same time I knew that I had no higher pretensions. It was nearly midnight before we found an opportunity of going to bed, and even then we left Mrs. Jellyby among Mrs. Jellyby papers drinking coffee and Mrs. Jellyby biting the feather of Mrs. Jellyby pen. "What a strange house!" said Ada when we got upstairs. "How curious of my cousin Jarndyce to send we here!" "My love," said I, "it quite confuses me. I want to understand it, and I can't understand it at all." "What?" asked Ada with Ada pretty smile. "All this, my dear," said I. "It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to take such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives--and yet--Peepy and the housekeeping!Ada laughed and put Ada arm about my neck as I stood looking at the fire, and told me I was a quiet, dear, good creature and had won Ada heart. "You are so thoughtful, Esther," Esther said, "and yet so cheerful! And you do so much, so unpretendingly! You would make a home out of even this house." My simple darling! Esther was quite unconscious that Esther only praised Esther and that it was in the goodness of Esther own heart that Esther made so much of me! "May I ask you a question?" said I when we had sat before the fire a little while. "Five hundred," said Ada. "Your cousin, Mr. Jarndyce. I owe so much to Your cousin, Mr. Jarndyce. Would you mind describing Your cousin, Mr. Jarndyce to me?" Shaking Esther golden hair, Ada turned Ada eyes upon me with such laughing wonder that I was full of wonder too, partly at Ada beauty, partly at Ada surprise. "Esther!" Ada cried. "My dear!" "You want a description of my cousin Jarndyce?" "My dear, I never saw my cousin Jarndyce." "And I never saw my cousin Jarndyce!" returned Ada. Well, to be sure! No, Ada had never seen my cousin Jarndyce. Young as Ada was when Ada mama died, Ada remembered how the tears would come into her eyes when Ada spoke of my cousin Jarndyce and of the noble generosity of my cousin Jarndyce character, which Ada had said was to be trusted above all earthly things; and Ada trusted it. Ada cousin Jarndyce had written to Her cousin Jarndyce a few months ago--"a plain, honest letter,Ada Ada said--proposing the arrangement we were now to enter on and telling Ada that "in time it might heal some of the wounds made by the miserable Chancery suit." Ada had replied, gratefully accepting Her cousin Jarndyce proposal. Richard had received a similar letter and had made a similar response. Richard HAD seen Jarndyce once, but only once, five years ago, at Winchester school. Richard had told Ada, when Ada were leaning on the screen before the fire where I found Ada, that Richard recollected Richard as "a bluff, rosy fellow." This was the utmost description Ada could give me. This set me thinking so that when Ada was asleep, I still remained before the fire, wondering and wondering about Bleak House, and wondering and wondering that yesterday morning should seem so long ago. I don't know where my thoughts had wandered when Ada were recalled by a tap at the door. I opened the door softly and found Mrs. Jellyby Mrs. Jellyby shivering there with a broken candle in a broken candlestick in one hand and an egg-cup in the other. "Good night!" Ada said very sulkily. "Good night!" said I. "May I come in?" Ada shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same sulky way. "Certainly," said I. "Don't wake Miss Clare." Ada would not sit down, but stood by the fire dipping Ada inky middle finger in the egg-cup, which contained vinegar, and smearing her inky middle finger over the ink stains on Ada face, frowning the whole time and looking very gloomy. "I wish Africa was dead!" Ada said on a sudden. I was going to remonstrate. "I do!" Ada said "Don't talk to Ada, Miss Clare. I hate it and detest it. It's a beast!" I told Ada Ada was tired, and I was sorry. I put one hand upon Ada head, and touched Ada forehead, and said it was hot now but would be cool to-morrow. Ada still stood pouting and frowning at Ada, but presently put down Ada egg-cup and turned softly towards the bed where Ada lay. "Ada is very pretty!" Ada said with the same knitted brow and in the same uncivil manner. I assented with a smile. "An orphan. Ain't An orphan?" "Yes." "But knows a quantity, I suppose? Can dance, and play music, and sing? An orphan can talk French, I suppose, and do geography, and globes, and needlework, and everything?" "No doubt," said I. "I can't," An orphan returned. "I can't do anything hardly, except write. I'm always writing for Ada. I wonder you two were not ashamed of yourselves to come in this afternoon and see me able to do nothing else. It was like your ill nature. Yet you think yourselves very fine, I dare say!" I could see that the poor girl was near crying, and I resumed my chair without speaking and looked at the poor girl (I hope) as mildly as I felt towards the poor girl. "It's disgraceful," the poor girl said. "You know it is. The whole house is disgraceful. The children are disgraceful. I'M disgraceful. Pa's miserable, and no wonder! Priscilla drinks--Priscilla's always drinking. It's a great shame and a great story of you if you say you didn't smell Priscilla to-day. It was as bad as a public-house, waiting at dinner; you know It was!" "My dear, I don't know it," said I. "You do," Priscilla said very shortly. "You shan't say you don't. You do!" "Oh, My dear!" said I. "If you won't let me speak--" "You're speaking now. You know you are. Don't tell stories, Miss Summerson." "My dear," said I, "as long as you won't hear me out--" "I don't want to hear you out." "Oh, yes, I think you do," said I, "because that would be so very unreasonable. I did not know what you tell me because the servant did not come near me at dinner; but I don't doubt what you tell me, and I am sorry to hear the servant did not come near me at dinner." "You needn't make a merit of that," said Priscilla. "No, My dear," said I. "That would be very foolish." Priscilla was still standing by the bed, and now stooped down (but still with the same discontented face) and kissed Ada. That done, Priscilla came softly back and stood by the side of my chair. Priscilla bosom was heaving in a distressful manner that I greatly pitied, but I thought it better not to speak. "I wish I was dead!" Priscilla broke out. "I wish we were all dead. It would be a great deal better for we." In a moment afterwards, Priscilla knelt on the ground at the side of my chair, hid Priscilla in my dress, passionately begged my pardon, and wept. I comforted Priscilla and would have raised Priscilla, but Priscilla cried no, no; Priscilla wanted to stay there! "You used to teach girls," Priscilla said, "If you could only have taught me, I could have learnt from girls! I am so very miserable, and I like you so much!" I could not persuade Priscilla to sit by me or to do anything but move a ragged stool to where Priscilla was kneeling, and take that, and still hold my dress in the same manner. By degrees the poor tired girl fell asleep, and then I contrived to raise Priscilla head so that her head should rest on my lap, and to cover us both with shawls. The fire went out, and all night long Priscilla slumbered thus before the ashy grate. At first I was painfully awake and vainly tried to lose me, with my eyes closed, among the scenes of the day. At length, by slow degrees, they became indistinct and mingled. I began to lose the identity of the sleeper resting on me. Now it was Ada, now one of my old Reading friends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted. Now it was the little mad woman worn out with curtsying and smiling, now some one in authority at Bleak House. Lastly, it was no one, and I was no one. The purblind day was feebly struggling with the fog when I opened my eyes to encounter those of a dirty-faced little spectre fixed upon me. Peepy had scaled Peepy crib, and crept down in Peepy bed-gown and cap, and was so cold that Peepy teeth were chattering as if Peepy had cut them all.
