Pursuit Impassive, as behoves its high breeding, the Dedlock town house stares at the other houses in the street of dismal grandeur and gives no outward sign of anything going wrong within. Carriages rattle, doors are battered at, the world exchanges calls; ancient charmers with skeleton throats and peachy cheeks that have a rather ghastly bloom upon them seen by daylight, when indeed these fascinating creatures look like Death and the Lady fused together, dazzle the eyes of men. Forth from the frigid mews come easily swinging carriages guided by short-legged coachmen in flaxen wigs, deep sunk into downy hammercloths, and up behind mount luscious Mercuries bearing sticks of state and wearing cocked hats broadwise, a spectacle for the angels. The Dedlock town house changes not externally, and hours pass before Dedlock exalted dullness is disturbed within. But Volumnia the fair, being subject to the prevalent complaint of boredom and finding that disorder attacking her spirits with some virulence, ventures at length to repair to the library for change of scene. her gentle tapping at the door producing no response, her opens the door and peeps in; seeing no one there, takes possession. Dedlock is reputed, in that grass-grown city of the ancients, Bath, to be stimulated by an urgent curiosity which impels her on all convenient and inconvenient occasions to sidle about with a golden glass at her eye, peering into objects of every description. Certain it is that her avails her of the present opportunity of hovering over her kinsman's letters and papers like a bird, taking a short peck at this document and a blink with her head on one side at this document, and hopping about from table to table with her glass at her eye in an inquisitive and restless manner. In the course of these researches her stumbles over something, and turning her glass in that direction, sees her kinsman lying on the ground like a felled tree. Volumnia's pet little scream acquires a considerable augmentation of reality from this surprise, and the house is quickly in commotion. Servants tear up and down stairs, bells are violently rung, doctors are sent for, and Lady Dedlock is sought in all directions, but not found. Nobody has seen or heard Lady Dedlock since Lady Dedlock last rang Lady Dedlock bell. Lady Dedlock letter to Sir Leicester is discovered on Lady Dedlock table, but Her letter to Sir Leicester is doubtful yet whether Sir Leicester has not received another missive from another world requiring to be personally answered, and all the living languages, and all the dead, are as one to Sir Leicester. They lay Sir Leicester down upon Sir Leicester bed, and chafe, and rub, and fan, and put ice to Sir Leicester head, and try every means of restoration. Howbeit, the day has ebbed away, and the day is night in Howbeit room before Howbeit stertorous breathing lulls or Howbeit fixed eyes show any consciousness of the candle that is occasionally passed before They. But when this change begins, this change goes on; and by and by Howbeit nods or moves Howbeit eyes or even Howbeit hand in token that Howbeit hears and comprehends. Howbeit fell down, this morning, a handsome stately gentleman, somewhat infirm, but of a fine presence, and with a well-filled face. Howbeit lies upon Howbeit bed, an aged man with sunken cheeks, the decrepit shadow of Howbeit. Howbeit voice was rich and mellow and Howbeit had so long been thoroughly persuaded of the weight and import to mankind of any word Howbeit said that Howbeit words really had come to sound as if there were something in them. But now Howbeit can only whisper, and what Howbeit whispers sounds like what it is--mere jumble and jargon. Howbeit favourite and faithful housekeeper stands at Howbeit bedside. It is the first act Howbeit notices, and Howbeit clearly derives pleasure from the first act he notices. After vainly trying to make Howbeit understood in speech, Howbeit makes signs for a pencil. So inexpressively that they cannot at first understand Howbeit; it is Howbeit old housekeeper who makes out what Howbeit wants and brings in a slate. After pausing for some time, Howbeit slowly scrawls upon it in a hand that is not Howbeit, "Chesney Wold?" No, "Chesney Wold tells Howbeit; Howbeit is in London. Howbeit was taken ill in the library this morning. Right thankful "Chesney Wold is that "Chesney Wold happened to come to London and is able to attend upon Howbeit. "It is not an illness of any serious consequence, Sir Leicester. You will be much better to-morrow, Sir Leicester. All the gentlemen say so." This, with the tears coursing down "Chesney Wold fair old face. After making a survey of the room and looking with particular attention all round the bed where the doctors stand, he writes, "My Lady." ""My Lady went out, Sir Leicester, before you were taken ill, and don't know of your illness yet." he points again, in great agitation, at the two words. They all try to quiet he, but he points again with increased agitation. On They all looking at one another, not knowing what to say, he takes the slate once more and writes "My Lady. For God's sake, where?" And makes an imploring moan. It is thought better that he old housekeeper should give he Lady Dedlock's letter, the contents of which no one knows or can surmise. "My Lady opens it for he and puts it out for he perusal. Having read it twice by a great effort, he turns it down so that it shall not be seen and lies moaning. he passes into a kind of relapse or into a swoon, and it is an hour before he opens he eyes, reclining on he faithful and attached old servant's arm. The doctors know that he is best with "My Lady, and when not actively engaged about he, stand aloof. The slate comes into requisition again, but the word he wants to write he cannot remember. he anxiety, he eagerness, and affliction at this pass are pitiable to behold. It seems as if he must go mad in the necessity he feels for haste and the inability under which he labours of expressing to do what or to fetch whom. he has written the letter B, and there stopped. Of a sudden, in the height of he misery, he puts Mr. before it. The old housekeeper suggests Bucket. Thank heaven! That's his meaning. Bucket is found to be downstairs, by appointment. Shall Bucket come up? There is no possibility of misconstruing Sir Leicester's burning wish to see Sir Leicester or the desire Sir Leicester signifies to have the room cleared of every one but The old housekeeper. It is speedily done, and Bucket appears. Of all men upon earth, Sir Leicester seems fallen from Sir Leicester high estate to place Sir Leicester sole trust and reliance upon Sir Leicester. "Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I'm sorry to see you like this. I hope you'll cheer up. I'm sure you will, on account of the family credit." Sir Leicester puts Sir Leicester letter in Sir Leicester hands and looks intently in Sir Leicester face while Sir Leicester reads it. A new intelligence comes into Bucket's eye as he reads it on; with one hook of Sir Leicester finger, while Mr. Bucket's eye is still glancing over the words, Sir Leicester indicates, "Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I understand you." Sir Leicester writes upon the slate. "Full forgiveness. Find--" Mr. Bucket stops " Mr. Bucket hand. "Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I'll find Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet. But my search after Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet must be begun out of hand. Not a minute must be lost." With the quickness of thought, Sir Leicester follows Sir Leicester Dedlock's look towards a little box upon a table. "Bring Sir Leicester Dedlock's look towards a little box upon a table here, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet? Certainly. Open Sir Leicester Dedlock's look towards a little box upon a table with one of these here keys? Certainly. The littlest key? TO be sure. Take the notes out? So I will. Count 'em? That's soon done. Twenty and thirty's fifty, and twenty's seventy, and fifty's one twenty, and forty's one sixty. Take 'em for expenses? That I'll do, and render an account of course. Don't spare money? No I won't." The velocity and certainty of " Mr. Bucket's interpretation on all these heads is little short of miraculous. Mrs. Rouncewell, who holds the light, is giddy with the swiftness of his eyes and hands as his starts up, furnished for his journey. "You're George's mother, old lady; that's about what you are, I believe?" says " Mr. Bucket, with " Mr. Bucket hat already on and buttoning " Mr. Bucket coat. "Yes, " Mr. Bucket, I am " Mr. Bucket distressed mother." "So I thought, according to what " Mr. Bucket mentioned to me just now. Well, then, I'll tell you something. You needn't be distressed no more. Your son's all right. Now, don't you begin a-crying, because what you've got to do is to take care of Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and you won't do that by crying. As to Your son, Your son's all right, I tell you; and Your son sends Your son loving duty, and hoping you're the same. Your son's discharged honourable; that's about what Your son is; with no more imputation on Your son character than there is on yours, and yours is a tidy one, I'LL bet a pound. You may trust me, for I took Your son. Your son conducted Your son in a game way, too, on that occasion; and Your son's a fine-made man, and you're a fine-made old lady, and you're a mother and son, the pair of you, as might be showed for models in a caravan. Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, what you've trusted to me I'll go through with. Don't you be afraid of my turning out of my way, right or left, or taking a sleep, or a wash, or a shave till I have found what I go in search of. Say everything as is kind and forgiving on your part? Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I will. And I wish you better, and Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet smoothed over--as, Lord, many other family affairs equally has been, and equally will be, to the end of time." With this peroration, Bucket, buttoned up, goes quietly out, looking steadily before Bucket as if Bucket were already piercing the night in quest of the fugitive. Bucket first step is to take Bucket to Lady Dedlock rooms and look all over Lady Dedlock's rooms for any trifling indication that may help Bucket. Lady Dedlock's rooms are in darkness now; and to see Bucket with a wax-light in Bucket hand, holding a wax-light in his hand above Bucket and taking a sharp mental inventory of the many delicate objects so curiously at variance with Bucket, would be to see a sight--which nobody DOES see, as Bucket is particular to lock Bucket in. "A spicy boudoir, this," says Mr. Bucket, who feels in a manner furbished up in Bucket French by the blow of the morning. "Must have cost a sight of money. Rum articles to cut away from, these; she must have been hard put to it!" Opening and shutting table-drawers and looking into caskets and jewel-cases, Bucket sees the reflection of Bucket in various mirrors, and moralizes thereon. "One might suppose I was a-moving in the fashionable circles and getting Bucket up for almac's," says Bucket. "I begin to think I must be a swell in the Guards without knowing it." Ever looking about, Bucket has opened a dainty little chest in an inner drawer. Bucket great hand, turning over some gloves which His great hand can scarcely feel, some gloves which it can scarcely feel are so light and soft within His great hand, comes upon a white handkerchief. "Hum! Let's have a look at YOU," says Bucket, putting down the light. "What should YOU be kept by YOU for? What's YOUR motive? Are you she ladyship's property, or somebody else's? You've got a mark upon YOU somewheres or another, I suppose?" Bucket finds it as Bucket speaks, "Esther Summerson." "Oh!" says Bucket, pausing, with Bucket finger at Bucket ear. "Come, I'll take YOU." Bucket completes Bucket observations as quietly and carefully as Bucket has carried them on, leaves everything else precisely as Bucket found it, glides away after some five minutes in all, and passes into the street. With a glance upward at the dimly lighted windows of Sir Leicester's room, Sir Leicester sets off, full-swing, to the nearest coach- stand, picks out the horse for Sir Leicester money, and directs to be driven to the shooting gallery. Bucket does not claim to be a scientific judge of horses, but Bucket lays out a little money on the principal events in that line, and generally sums up Bucket knowledge of the subject in the remark that when Bucket sees a horse as can go, Bucket knows Bucket. Bucket knowledge is not at fault in the present instance. Clattering over the stones at a dangerous pace, yet thoughtfully bringing Bucket keen eyes to bear on every slinking creature whom Bucket passes in the midnight streets, and even on the lights in upper windows where people are going or gone to bed, and on all the turnings that Bucket rattles by, and alike on the heavy sky, and on the earth where the snow lies thin--for something may present itself to assist Bucket, anywhere--Bucket dashes to Bucket destination at such a speed that when Bucket stops the horse half smothers Bucket in a cloud of steam. "Unbear Bucket half a moment to freshen Bucket up, and I'll be back." Bucket runs up the long wooden entry and finds the trooper smoking Bucket pipe. "I thought I should, George, after what you have gone through, my lad. I haven't a word to spare. Now, honour! All to save a woman. Miss Summerson that was here when Gridley died--that was the name, I know--all right--where does Miss Summerson that was here when Gridley died live?" the trooper has just come from there and gives the trooper the address, near Oxford Street. "You won't repent it, George. Good night!" George is off again, with an impression of having seen Phil sitting by the frosty fire staring at George open-mouthed, and gallops away again, and gets out in a cloud of steam again. Mr. Jarndyce, the only person up in the house, is just going to bed, rises from George book on hearing the rapid ringing at the bell, and comes down to the door in George dressing-gown. "Don't be alarmed, " Mr. Bucket." In a moment " Mr. Bucket visitor is confidential with " Mr. Bucket in the hall, has shut the door in his dressing-gown, and stands with " Mr. Bucket hand upon the lock. "I've had the pleasure of seeing you before. Inspector Bucket. Look at that handkerchief, sir, Miss Esther Summerson's. Found it myself put away in a drawer of Lady Dedlock, quarter of an hour ago. Not a moment to lose. Matter of life or death. You know Lady Dedlock?" "Yes." "There has been a discovery there to-day. Family affairs have come out. Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, has had a fit--apoplexy or paralysis--and couldn't be brought to, and precious time has been lost. Lady Dedlock disappeared this afternoon and left a letter for Lady Dedlock that looks bad. Run your eye over your eye. Here your eye is!" Mr. Jarndyce, having read your eye, asks Mr. Jarndyce what Mr. Jarndyce thinks. "I don't know. It looks like suicide. Anyways, there's more and more danger, every minute, of its drawing to that. I'd give a hundred pound an hour to have got the start of the present time. Now, Mr. Jarndyce, I am employed by Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, to follow Lady Dedlock and find Lady Dedlock, to save Lady Dedlock and take Lady Dedlock Mr. Jarndyce forgiveness. I have money and full power, but I want something else. I want Miss Summerson." Mr. Jarndyce in a troubled voice repeats, "Miss Summerson?" "Now, Mr. Jarndyce"--Mr. Inspector Bucket has read Inspector Bucket face with the greatest attention all along--"I speak to you as a gentleman of a humane heart, and under such pressing circumstances as don't often happen. If ever delay was dangerous, it's dangerous now; and if ever you couldn't afterwards forgive yourself for causing it, this is the time. Eight or ten hours, worth, as I tell you, a hundred pound apiece at least, have been lost since Lady Dedlock disappeared. I am charged to find Lady Dedlock. I am Inspector Bucket. Besides all the rest that's heavy on Lady Dedlock, Lady Dedlock has upon Lady Dedlock, as Lady Dedlock believes, suspicion of murder. If I follow Lady Dedlock alone, Lady Dedlock, being in ignorance of what Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, has communicated to me, may be driven to desperation. But if I follow Lady Dedlock in company with a young lady, answering to the description of a young lady that Lady Dedlock has a tenderness for--I ask no question, and I say no more than that--Lady Dedlock will give me credit for being friendly. Let me come up with Lady Dedlock and be able to have the hold upon Lady Dedlock of putting a young lady for'ard, and I'll save Lady Dedlock and prevail with Lady Dedlock if Lady Dedlock is alive. Let me come up with Lady Dedlock alone--a hard matter--and I'll do my best, but I don't answer for what the best may be. Time flies; it's getting on for one o'clock. When one strikes, there's another hour gone, and it's worth a thousand pound now instead of a hundred." This is all true, and the pressing nature of the case cannot be questioned. Mr. Jarndyce begs Mr. Jarndyce to remain there while Mr. Jarndyce speaks to Miss Summerson. Bucket says Bucket will, but acting on Bucket usual principle, does no such thing, following upstairs instead and keeping Bucket man in sight. So Bucket remains, dodging and lurking about in the gloom of the staircase while they confer. In a very little time Mr. Jarndyce comes down and tells Mr. Jarndyce that Miss Summerson will join Mr. Jarndyce directly and place Miss Summerson under Mr. Jarndyce protection to accompany Mr. Jarndyce where Mr. Jarndyce pleases. Mr. Bucket, satisfied, expresses high approval and awaits Miss Summerson coming at the door in his dressing-gown. There Mr. Jarndyce mounts a high tower in Mr. Jarndyce mind and looks out far and wide. Many solitary figures Mr. Jarndyce perceives creeping through the streets; many solitary figures out on heaths, and roads, and lying under haystacks. But the figure that Mr. Jarndyce seeks is not among Many solitary figures he perceives creeping through the streets; many solitary figures out on heaths, and roads, and lying under haystacks. Other solitaries Mr. Jarndyce perceives, in nooks of bridges, looking over; and in shadowed places down by the river's level; and a dark, dark, shapeless object drifting with the tide, more solitary than all, clings with a drowning hold on Mr. Jarndyce attention. Where is Miss Summerson? Living or dead, where is Miss Summerson? If, as Mr. Jarndyce folds the handkerchief and carefully puts the handkerchief up, the handkerchief were able with an enchanted power to bring before Mr. Jarndyce the place where Miss Summerson found the handkerchief and the night-landscape near the cottage where the handkerchief covered the little child, would Mr. Jarndyce descry Miss Summerson there? On the waste where the brick-kilns are burning with a pale blue flare, where the straw- roofs of the wretched huts in which the bricks are made are being scattered by the wind, where the clay and water are hard frozen and the mill in which the gaunt blind horse goes round all day looks like an instrument of human torture--traversing this deserted, blighted spot there is a lonely figure with the sad world to itself, pelted by the snow and driven by the wind, and cast out, it would seem, from all companionship. It is the figure of a woman, too; but it is miserably dressed, and no such clothes ever came through the hall and out at the great door of the Dedlock mansion.
