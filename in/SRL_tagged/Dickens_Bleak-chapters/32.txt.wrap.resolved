Esther's Narrative Richard had been gone away some time when a visitor came to pass a few days with us. It was an elderly lady. It was Mrs. Woodcourt, who, having come from Wales to stay with Mrs. Bayham Badger and having written to my guardian, "by Mrs. Bayham Badger son Allan's desire," to report that Mrs. Bayham Badger had heard from him and that him was well "and sent him kind remembrances to all of us," had been invited by my guardian to make a visit to Bleak House. Mrs. Bayham Badger stayed with us nearly three weeks. Mrs. Bayham Badger took very kindly to me and was extremely confidential, so much so that sometimes Mrs. Bayham Badger almost made me uncomfortable. I had no right, I knew very well, to be uncomfortable because Mrs. Bayham Badger confided in me, and I felt it was unreasonable; still, with all I could do, I could not quite help it. Mrs. Bayham Badger was such a sharp little lady and used to sit with Mrs. Bayham Badger hands folded in each other looking so very watchful while Mrs. Bayham Badger talked to me that perhaps I found that rather irksome. Or perhaps it was Mrs. Bayham Badger being so upright and trim, though I don't think it was that, because I thought that quaintly pleasant. Nor can it have been the general expression of Mrs. Bayham Badger face, which was very sparkling and pretty for an old lady. I don't know what it was. Or at least if I do now, I thought I did not then. Or at least--but it don't matter. Of a night when I was going upstairs to bed, Mrs. Bayham Badger would invite me into Mrs. Bayham Badger room, where Mrs. Bayham Badger sat before the fire in a great chair; and, dear me, Mrs. Bayham Badger would tell me about Morgan ap-Kerrig until I was quite low- spirited! Sometimes Mrs. Bayham Badger recited a few verses from Crumlinwallinwer and the Mewlinnwillinwodd (if those are the right names, which I dare say those are not), and would become quite fiery with the sentiments those expressed. Though I never knew what those were (being in Welsh), further than that those were highly eulogistic of the lineage of Morgan ap-Kerrig. "So, Miss Summerson," Mrs. Bayham Badger would say to me with stately triumph, "this, you see, is the fortune inherited by my son. Wherever my son goes, my son can claim kindred with Morgan ap-Kerrig. my son may not have money, but my son always has what is much better--family, my dear." I had my doubts of family, my dear caring so very much for Morgan ap-Kerrig in India and China, but of course I never expressed family, my dear. I used to say it was a great thing to be so highly connected. "It IS, my dear, a great thing," Mrs. Woodcourt would reply. "It has It disadvantages; my son's choice of a wife, for instance, is limited by It, but the matrimonial choice of the royal family is limited in much the same manner." Then she would pat me on the arm and smooth my dress, as much as to assure me that she had a good opinion of me, the distance between us notwithstanding. "Poor Mr. Woodcourt, my dear," she would say, and always with some emotion, for with she lofty pedigree she had a very affectionate heart, "was descended from a great Highland family, the MacCoorts of MacCoort. He served He king and country as an officer in the Royal Highlanders, and He died on the field. my son is one of the last representatives of two old families. With the blessing of heaven He will set the last representatives of two old families up again and unite the last representatives of two old families with another old family." It was in vain for me to try to change the subject, as I used to try, only for the sake of novelty or perhaps because--but I need not be so particular. Mrs. Woodcourt never would let me change it. "My dear," Mrs. Woodcourt said one night, "you have so much sense and you look at the world in a quiet manner so superior to your time of life that it is a comfort to me to talk to you about these family matters of mine. You don't know much of my son, my dear; but you know enough of He, I dare say, to recollect He?" "Yes, ma'am. I recollect He." "Yes, my dear. Now, my dear, I think you are a judge of character, and I should like to have your opinion of character." "Oh, Mrs. Woodcourt," said I, "that is so difficult!" "Why is it so difficult, my dear?" she returned. "I don't see it me." "To give an opinion--" "On so slight an acquaintance, my dear. THAT'S true." I didn't mean that, because Mrs. Woodcourt had been at our house a good deal altogether and had become quite intimate with my guardian. I said so, and added that Mrs. Woodcourt seemed to be very clever in Mrs. Woodcourt profession--we thought--and that Mrs. Woodcourt kindness and gentleness to Miss Flite were above all praise. "You do Mrs. Woodcourt justice!" said Mrs. Woodcourt, pressing my hand. "You define Mrs. Woodcourt exactly. Allan is a dear fellow, and in Allan profession faultless. I say it, though I am Allan mother. Still, I must confess Allan is not without faults, love." "None of us are," said I. "Ah! But Allan really are faults that Allan might correct, and ought to correct," returned the sharp old lady, sharply shaking the sharp old lady head. "I am so much attached to you that I may confide in you, my dear, as a third party wholly disinterested, that Allan is fickleness a third party." I said I should have thought it hardly possible that Allan could have been otherwise than constant to Allan profession and zealous in the pursuit of it, judging from the reputation Allan had earned. "You are right again, my dear," the sharp old lady retorted, "but I don't refer to his profession, look you." "Oh!" said I. "No," said the sharp old lady. "I refer, my dear, to Allan social conduct. Allan is always paying trivial attentions to young ladies, and always has been, ever since Allan was eighteen. Now, my dear, Allan has never really cared for any one of young ladies and has never meant in doing this to do any harm or to express anything but politeness and good nature. Still, it's not right, you know; is it?" "No," said I, as the sharp old lady seemed to wait for me. "And it might lead to mistaken notions, you see, my dear." I supposed it might. "Therefore, I have told my dear many times that my dear really should be more careful, both in justice to my dear and in justice to others. And my dear has always said, 'the sharp old lady, I will be; but you know me better than anybody else does, and you know I mean no harm--in short, mean nothing.' All of which is very true, my dear, but is no justification. However, as my dear is now gone so far away and for an indefinite time, and as my dear will have good opportunities and introductions, we may consider this past and gone. And you, my dear," said the old lady, who was now all nods and smiles, "regarding your dear self, my love?" "Me, Mrs. Woodcourt?" "Not to be always selfish, talking of my son, who has gone to seek his fortune and to find a wife--when do you mean to seek YOUR fortune and to find a husband, Miss Summerson? Hey, look you! Now you blush!" I don't think I did blush--at all events, it was not important if I did--and I said YOUR fortune perfectly contented me and I had no wish to change it. "Shall I tell you what I always think of you and YOUR fortune to come for you, my love?" said Mrs. Woodcourt. "If you believe you are a good prophet," said I. "Why, then, it is that you will marry some one very rich and very worthy, much older--five and twenty years, perhaps--than yourself. And you will be an excellent wife, and much beloved, and very happy." "That is a good fortune," said I. "But why is it to be mine?" "my dear," my dear returned, "there's suitability in it--you are so busy, and so neat, and so peculiarly situated altogether that there's suitability in it, and it will come to pass. And nobody, my love, will congratulate you more sincerely on such a marriage than I shall." It was curious that this should make me uncomfortable, but I think this did. I know this did. this made me for some part of that night uncomfortable. I was so ashamed of my folly that I did not like to confess this even to Ada, and that made me more uncomfortable still. I would have given anything not to have been so much in the bright old lady's confidence if I could have possibly declined this. this gave me the most inconsistent opinions of my dear. At one time I thought my dear was a story-teller, and at another time that my dear was the pink of truth. Now I suspected that my dear was very cunning, next moment I believed my dear honest Welsh heart to be perfectly innocent and simple. And after all, what did it matter to me, and why did it matter to me? Why could not I, going up to bed with my basket of keys, stop to sit down by my dear fire and accommodate me for a little while to my dear, at least as well as to anybody else, and not trouble me about the harmless things my dear said to me? Impelled towards my dear, as I certainly was, for I was very anxious that my dear should like me and was very glad indeed that my dear did, why should I harp afterwards, with actual distress and pain, on every word my dear said and weigh it over and over again in twenty scales? Why was it so worrying to me to have my dear in our house, and confidential to me every night, when I yet felt that it was better and safer somehow that my dear should be there than anywhere else? These were perplexities and contradictions that I could not account for. At least, if I could--but I shall come to all that by and by, and it is mere idleness to go on about it now. So when Mrs. Woodcourt went away, I was sorry to lose Mrs. Woodcourt but was relieved too. And then Caddy Jellyby came down, and Caddy brought such a packet of domestic news that Caddy Jellyby gave us abundant occupation. First Caddy declared (and would at first declare nothing else) that I was the best adviser that ever was known. This, my pet said, was no news at all; and This, I said, of course, was nonsense. Then Caddy told us that Caddy was going to be married in a month and that if Ada and I would be Caddy bridesmaids, Caddy was the happiest girl in the world. To be sure, this was news indeed; and I thought us never should have done talking about news, us had so much to say to Caddy, and Caddy had so much to say to us. It seemed that Caddy's unfortunate papa had got over Caddy's unfortunate papa bankruptcy--"gone through the Gazette," was the expression Caddy used, as if the expression Caddy used were a tunnel--with the general clemency and commiseration of Caddy's unfortunate papa creditors, and had got rid of Caddy's unfortunate papa affairs in some blessed manner without succeeding in understanding some blessed manner, and had given up everything Caddy's unfortunate papa possessed (which was not worth much, I should think, to judge from the state of the furniture), and had satisfied every one concerned that Caddy's unfortunate papa could do no more, poor man. So, Caddy's unfortunate papa had been honourably dismissed to "the office" to begin the world again. What Caddy's unfortunate papa did at "the office, I never knew; Caddy said Caddy's unfortunate papa was a "custom-house and general agent," and the only thing I ever understood about that business was that when Caddy's unfortunate papa wanted money more than usual Caddy's unfortunate papa went to the docks to look for it, and hardly ever found it. As soon as Caddy papa had tranquillized Caddy's unfortunate papa mind by becoming this shorn lamb, and they had removed to a furnished lodging in Hatton Garden (where I found the children, when I afterwards went there, cutting the horse hair out of the seats of the chairs and choking the children with the horse hair), Caddy had brought about a meeting between Caddy's unfortunate papa and old Mr. Turveydrop; and poor Mr. Jellyby, being very humble and meek, had deferred to Mr. Turveydrop's deportment so submissively that the children had become excellent friends. By degrees, old Mr. Turveydrop, thus familiarized with the idea of his son's marriage, had worked up his parental feelings to the height of contemplating that event as being near at hand and had given his gracious consent to the young couple commencing housekeeping at the academy in Newman Street when the young couple commencing housekeeping at the academy in Newman Street would. "And your papa, Caddy. What did his say?" "Oh! Poor Pa," said Caddy, "only cried and said his hoped Poor Pa might get on better than his and Ma had got on. his didn't say so before his, his only said so to Ma. And his said, 'My poor girl, you have not been very well taught how to make a home for your husband, but unless you mean with all your heart to strive to do it, you had better murder your husband than marry your husband--if you really love your husband.'" "And how did you reassure his, Caddy?" "Why, it was very distressing, you know, to see Poor Pa so low and hear his say such terrible things, and I couldn't help crying Ma. But I told his that I DID mean it with all my heart and that I hoped Poor Pa would be a place for his to come and find some comfort in of an evening and that I hoped and thought I could be a better daughter to his there than at home. Then I mentioned Peepy's coming to stay with Ma, and then Poor Pa began to cry again and said the children were Indians." "Indians, Caddy?" "Yes," said Caddy, "wild Indians. And Pa said"--here Pa said"--here began to sob, poor girl, not at all like the happiest girl in the world-- "that the happiest girl in the world-- was sensible the best thing that could happen to them was them being all tomahawked together." Ada suggested that it was comfortable to know that Caddy Jellyby did not mean these destructive sentiments. "No, of course I know Poor Pa wouldn't like the happiest girl in the world-- family to be weltering in his family blood," said Caddy, "but the happiest girl in the world-- means that his family are very unfortunate in being Ma's children and that the happiest girl in the world-- is very unfortunate in being Ma's husband; and I am sure that's true, though it seems unnatural to say so." I asked Caddy if Caddy Jellyby knew that Caddy Jellyby wedding-day was fixed. "Oh! You know what Ma is, Esther," Esther returned. "It's impossible to say whether Esther knows it or not. Esther has been told it often enough; and when Esther IS told it, Esther only gives me a placid look, as if I was I don't know what--a steeple in the distance," said Caddy with a sudden idea; "and then Esther shakes Esther and says 'Oh, Caddy, Caddy, what a tease you are!' and goes on with the Borrioboola letters." "And about your wardrobe, Caddy?" said I. For Esther was under no restraint with us. "Well, my dear Esther," Esther returned, drying Esther eyes, "I must do the best I can and trust to his never to have an unkind remembrance of my coming so shabbily to his. If the question concerned an outfit for Borrioboola, Ma would know all about it and would be quite excited. Being what it is, Ma neither knows nor cares." Caddy was not at all deficient in natural affection for Caddy mother, but mentioned this with tears as an undeniable fact, which I am afraid this was. us were sorry for My poor girl and found so much to admire in the good disposition which had survived under such discouragement that us both at once (I mean Ada and I) proposed a little scheme that made Ma perfectly joyful. This was Ma staying with us for three weeks, my staying with Ma for one, and our all three contriving and cutting out, and repairing, and sewing, and saving, and doing the very best us could think of to make the most of Ma stock. My guardian being as pleased with the idea as Caddy was, us took Caddy home next day to arrange the matter and brought Caddy out again in triumph with Caddy boxes and all the purchases that could be squeezed out of a ten-pound note, which Caddy Jellyby had found in the docks I suppose, but which Caddy Jellyby at all events gave Caddy. What My guardian would not have given Caddy if us had encouraged Caddy Jellyby, it would be difficult to say, but us thought it right to compound for no more than Caddy wedding-dress and bonnet. Caddy Jellyby agreed to this compromise, and if Caddy had ever been happy in Caddy life, Caddy was happy when us sat down to work. Caddy was clumsy enough with Caddy needle, poor girl, and pricked Caddy fingers as much as Caddy had been used to ink her needle, poor girl. Caddy could not help reddening a little now and then, partly with the smart and partly with vexation at being able to do no better, but Caddy soon got over that and began to improve rapidly. So day after day Caddy, and my darling, and my little maid Charley, and a milliner out of the town, and I, sat hard at work, as pleasantly as possible. Over and above this, Caddy was very anxious "to learn housekeeping," as Caddy said. Now, mercy upon us! The idea of Caddy learning housekeeping of a person of my vast experience was such a joke that I laughed, and coloured up, and fell into a comical confusion when Caddy proposed it. However, I said, "Caddy, I am sure you are very welcome to learn anything that you can learn of ME, my dear," and I showed Caddy all my books and methods and all my fidgety ways. You would have supposed that I was showing Caddy some wonderful inventions, by Caddy study of some wonderful inventions; and if you had seen Caddy, whenever I jingled my housekeeping keys, get up and attend me, certainly you might have thought that there never was a greater imposter than I with a blinder follower than Caddy Jellyby. So what with working and housekeeping, and lessons to Charley, and backgammon in the evening with My guardian, and duets with Ada, the three weeks slipped fast away. Then I went home with Caddy to see what could be done there, and Ada and Charley remained behind to take care of My guardian. When I say I went home with Caddy, I mean to the furnished lodging in Hatton Garden. We went to Newman Street two or three times, where preparations were in progress too--a good many, I observed, for enhancing the comforts of old Mr. Turveydrop, and a few for putting the newly married couple away cheaply at the top of the house--but We great point was to make the furnished lodging decent for the wedding-breakfast and to imbue Caddy Jellyby beforehand with some faint sense of the occasion. The latter was the more difficult thing of the two because Mrs. Jellyby and an unwholesome boy occupied the front sitting-room (the back one was a mere closet), and the back one was littered down with waste- paper and Borrioboolan documents, as an untidy stable might be littered with straw. Caddy Jellyby sat there all day drinking strong coffee, dictating, and holding Borrioboolan interviews by appointment. The unwholesome boy, who seemed to Caddy Jellyby to be going into a decline, took his meals out of the house. When Caddy Jellyby came home, Caddy Jellyby usually groaned and went down into the kitchen. There Caddy Jellyby got something to eat if the servant would give the servant anything, and then, feeling that Caddy Jellyby was in the way, went out and walked about Hatton Garden in the wet. The poor children scrambled up and tumbled down the house as The poor children had always been accustomed to do. The production of these devoted little sacrifices in any presentable condition being quite out of the question at a week's notice, I proposed to Caddy that we should make The poor children as happy as we could on Caddy marriage morning in the attic where they all slept, and should confine we greatest efforts to Caddy mama and Caddy mama's room, and a clean breakfast. In truth Caddy Jellyby required a good deal of attention, the lattice-work up Caddy Jellyby back having widened considerably since I first knew Caddy Jellyby and Caddy Jellyby hair looking like the mane of a dustman's horse. Thinking that the display of Caddy's wardrobe would be the best means of approaching the subject, I invited Caddy Jellyby to come and look at the subject spread out on Caddy's bed in the evening after an unwholesome boy was gone. "My dear Miss Summerson," said My dear Miss Summerson, rising from My dear Miss Summerson desk with My dear Miss Summerson usual sweetness of temper, "these are really ridiculous preparations, though your assisting "these is a proof of your kindness. There is something so inexpressibly absurd to me in the idea of Caddy being married! Oh, Caddy, you silly, silly, silly puss!" My dear Miss Summerson came upstairs with us notwithstanding and looked at the clothes in My dear Miss Summerson customary far-off manner. They suggested one distinct idea to My dear Miss Summerson, for My dear Miss Summerson said with My dear Miss Summerson placid smile, and shaking My dear Miss Summerson head, "My good Miss Summerson, at half the cost, this weak child might have been equipped for Africa!" On us going downstairs again, Caddy Jellyby asked me whether this troublesome business was really to take place next Wednesday. And on my replying yes, Caddy Jellyby said, "Will my room be required, My dear Miss Summerson? For it's quite impossible that I can put my papers away." I took the liberty of saying that my room would certainly be wanted and that I thought us must put my papers away somewhere. "Well, My dear Miss Summerson," said Caddy Jellyby, "you know best, I dare say. But by obliging me to employ a boy, Caddy has embarrassed me to that extent, overwhelmed as I am with public business, that I don't know which way to turn. We have a Ramification meeting, too, on Wednesday afternoon, and the inconvenience is very serious." "It is not likely to occur again," said I, smiling. "Caddy will be married but once, probably." "That's true," Mrs. Jellyby replied; "that's true, my dear. I suppose We must make the best of it!" The next question was how Caddy Jellyby should be dressed on the occasion. I thought it very curious to see Caddy Jellyby looking on serenely from Caddy Jellyby writing-table while Caddy and I discussed it, occasionally shaking Caddy Jellyby head at We with a half-reproachful smile like a superior spirit who could just bear with We trifling. The state in which Caddy Jellyby dresses were, and the extraordinary confusion in which Caddy Jellyby kept her dresses, added not a little to We difficulty; but at length We devised something not very unlike what a common-place mother might wear on such an occasion. The abstracted manner in which Caddy Jellyby would deliver Caddy Jellyby up to having this attire tried on by the dressmaker, and the sweetness with which Caddy Jellyby would then observe to me how sorry Caddy Jellyby was that I had not turned my thoughts to Africa, were consistent with the rest of Caddy Jellyby behaviour. The lodging was rather confined as to space, but I fancied that if Caddy Jellyby's household had been the only lodgers in Saint Paul's or Saint Peter's, the sole advantage Mrs. Jellyby's household had been the only lodgers in Saint Paul's or Saint Peter would have found in the size of the building would have been the building affording a great deal of room to be dirty in. I believe that nothing belonging to the family which it had been possible to break was unbroken at the time of those preparations for Caddy's marriage, that nothing which nothing belonging to the family which it had been possible to break was had been possible to spoil in any way was unspoilt, and that no domestic object which was capable of collecting dirt, from a dear child's knee to the door-plate, was without as much dirt as could well accumulate upon it. Poor Mr. Jellyby, who very seldom spoke and almost always sat when he was at home with he head against the wall, became interested when he saw that Caddy and I were attempting to establish some order among all this waste and ruin and took off he coat to help. But such wonderful things came tumbling out of the closets when the closets were opened--bits of mouldy pie, sour bottles, Caddy Jellyby's caps, letters, tea, forks, odd boots and shoes of children, firewood, wafers, saucepan-lids, damp sugar in odds and ends of paper bags, footstools, blacklead brushes, bread, Caddy Jellyby's bonnets, books with butter sticking to the binding, guttered candle ends put out by being turned upside down in broken candlesticks, nutshells, heads and tails of shrimps, dinner-mats, gloves, coffee- grounds, umbrellas--that he looked frightened, and left off again. But he came regularly every evening and sat without his coat, with his head against the wallthe wall, as though he would have helped us if he had known how. "Poor Pa!" said Caddy to Caddy on the night before the great day, when us really had got things a little to rights. "It seems unkind to leave he, Esther. But what could I do if I stayed! Since I first knew you, I have tidied and tidied over and over again, but it's useless. Ma and Africa, together, upset the whole house directly. us never have a servant who don't drink. Ma's ruinous to everything." Caddy Jellyby could not hear what Caddy Jellyby said, but Caddy Jellyby seemed very low indeed and shed tears, I thought. "My heart aches for Caddy Jellyby; that My heart does!" sobbed Caddy. "I can't help thinking to-night, Esther, how dearly I hope to be happy with Prince, and how dearly Poor Pa hoped, I dare say, to be happy with Ma. What a disappointed life!" "My dear Caddy!" said Caddy Jellyby, looking slowly round from the wail. It was the first time, I think, I ever heard Caddy Jellyby say three words together. "Yes, Poor Pa!" cried Caddy, going to Caddy Jellyby and embracing Caddy Jellyby affectionately. "Caddy," said Caddy Jellyby. "Never have--" "Not Prince, Pa?" faltered Caddy. "Not have Prince?" "Yes, my dear," said Caddy Jellyby. "Have Caddy Jellyby, certainly. But, never have--" I mentioned in my account of our first visit in Thavies Inn that Richard described Caddy Jellyby as frequently opening Caddy Jellyby mouth after dinner without saying anything. It was a habit of his. his opened his now a great many times and shook his head in a melancholy manner. "What do you wish me not to have? Don't have what, Poor Pa?" asked Caddy, coaxing Caddy, with Poor Pa arms round Caddy neck. "Never have a mission, my dear child." Caddy Jellyby groaned and laid his head against the wall again, and this was the only time I ever heard Caddy Jellyby make any approach to expressing Caddy Jellyby sentiments on the Borrioboolan question. I suppose Caddy Jellyby had been more talkative and lively once, but Caddy Jellyby seemed to have been completely exhausted long before I knew Caddy Jellyby. I thought Caddy Jellyby never would have left off serenely looking over Caddy Jellyby papers and drinking coffee that night. It was twelve o'clock before we could obtain possession of the room, and the clearance the room required then was so discouraging that Caddy, who was almost tired out, sat down in the middle of the dust and cried. But Caddy Jellyby soon cheered up, and we did wonders with it before we went to bed. In the morning it looked, by the aid of a few flowers and a quantity of soap and water and a little arrangement, quite gay. The plain breakfast made a cheerful show, and Caddy was perfectly charming. But when my darling came, I thought--and I think now-- that I never had seen such a dear face as my beautiful pet's. we made a little feast for the children upstairs, and we put Peepy at the head of the table, and we showed the children upstairs Caddy in Caddy Jellyby bridal dress, and the children upstairs clapped the children upstairs hands and hurrahed, and Caddy cried to think that Caddy Jellyby was going away from the children upstairs and hugged the children upstairs over and over again until we brought Prince up to fetch Caddy Jellyby away--when, I am sorry to say, Peepy bit Prince. Then there was old Mr. Turveydrop downstairs, in a state of deportment not to be expressed, benignly blessing Caddy and giving my guardian to understand that old Mr. Turveydrop son's happiness was old Mr. Turveydrop own parental work and that old Mr. Turveydrop sacrificed personal considerations to ensure it. "My dear sir," said Mr. Turveydrop, "these young people will live with My dear sir; my house is large enough for "these young people accommodation, and "these young people shall not want the shelter of my roof. I could have wished--you will understand the allusion, Mr. Jarndyce, for you remember my illustrious patron the Prince Regent --I could have wished that my son had married into a family where there was more deportment, but the will of heaven be done!Mr. Quale were of the party--Mr. Pardiggle, an obstinate-looking man with a large waistcoat and stubbly hair, who was always talking in a loud bass voice about my son mite, or Mrs. Pardiggle's mite, or their five boys' mites. Mr. Quale, with Mr. Quale hair brushed back as usual and Mr. Quale knobs of temples shining very much, was also there, not in the character of a disappointed lover, but as the accepted of a young--at least, an unmarried--lady, a Miss Wisk, who was also there. Miss Wisk's mission, my guardian said, was to show the world that woman's mission was man's mission and that the only genuine mission of both man and woman was to be always moving declaratory resolutions about things in general at public meetings. The guests were few, but were, as one might expect at Caddy Jellyby's, all devoted to public objects only. Besides those I have mentioned, there was an extremely dirty lady with her bonnet all awry and the ticketed price of her dress still sticking on it, whose neglected home, Caddy told me, was like a filthy wilderness, but whose church was like a fancy fair. A very contentious gentleman, who said it was his mission to be everybody's brother but who appeared to be on terms of coolness with the whole of his large family, completed the party. A party, having less in common with such an occasion, could hardly have been got together by any ingenuity. Such a mean mission as the domestic mission was the very last thing to be endured among them; indeed, Miss Wisk informed us, with great indignation, before us sat down to breakfast, that the idea of woman's mission lying chiefly in the narrow sphere of home was an outrageous slander on the part of her tyrant, man. One other singularity was that nobody with a mission--except Mr. Quale, whose mission, as I think I have formerly said, was to be in ecstasies with everybody's mission-- cared at all for anybody's mission. Mrs. Pardiggle being as clear that the only one infallible course was Mrs. Pardiggle course of pouncing upon the poor and applying benevolence to the poor like a strait-waistcoat; as Miss Wisk was that the only practical thing for the world was the emancipation of woman from the thraldom of woman . Mrs. Jellyby, all the while, sat smiling at the limited vision that could see anything but Borrioboola-Gha. But I am anticipating now the purport of our conversation on the ride home instead of first marrying Caddy. We all went to church, and Caddy Jellyby gave Caddy Jellyby away. Of the air with which old Mr. Turveydrop, with Caddy Jellyby hat under Caddy Jellyby left arm (the inside presented at the clergyman like a cannon) and Caddy Jellyby eyes creasing themselves up into Caddy Jellyby wig, stood stiff and high-shouldered behind us bridesmaids during the ceremony, and afterwards saluted our, I could never say enough to do it justice. Miss Wisk, whom I cannot report as prepossessing in appearance, and whose manner was grim, listened to the proceedings, as part of woman's wrongs, with a disdainful face. Caddy Jellyby, with Caddy Jellyby calm smile and Caddy Jellyby bright eyes, looked the least concerned of all the company. our duly came back to breakfast, and Caddy Jellyby sat at the head of the table and Caddy Jellyby. Caddy had previously stolen upstairs to hug the children again and tell the children that Caddy name was Turveydrop. But this piece of information, instead of being an agreeable surprise to Peepy, threw Caddy on Caddy back in such transports of kicking grief that I could do nothing on being sent for but accede to the proposal that Caddy should be admitted to the breakfast table. So Caddy came down and sat in my lap; and Mrs. Jellyby, after saying, in reference to the state of Caddy pinafore, "Oh, you naughty Peepy, what a shocking little pig you are!" was not at all discomposed. Caddy was very good except that Caddy brought down Noah with Caddy (out of an ark I had given Caddy before we went to church) and WOULD dip Caddy head first into the wine-glasses and then put Caddy in his mouth. My guardian, with Caddy sweet temper and Caddy quick perception and Caddy amiable face, made something agreeable even out of the ungenial company. None of My guardian, with his sweet temper and his quick perception and his amiable face seemed able to talk about anything but Caddy, or her, own one subject, and none of My guardian, with his sweet temper and his quick perception and his amiable face seemed able to talk about even that as part of a world in which there was anything else; but my guardian turned it all to the merry encouragement of Caddy and the honour of the occasion, and brought we through The plain breakfast nobly. What we should have done without my guardian, I am afraid to think, for all the company despising the bride and bridegroom and old Mr. Turveydrop--and old Mr. Thurveydrop, in virtue of my guardian deportment, considering my guardian vastly superior to all the company--it was a very unpromising case. At last the time came when poor Caddy was to go and when all poor Caddy property was packed on the hired coach and pair that was to take poor Caddy and poor Caddy husband to Gravesend. It affected we to see poor Caddy clinging, then, to poor Caddy deplorable home and hanging on poor Caddy mother's neck with the greatest tenderness. "I am very sorry I couldn't go on writing from dictation, Ma," sobbed Caddy. "I hope you forgive me now." "Oh, Caddy, Caddy!" said Caddy Jellyby. "I have told you over and over again that I have engaged a boy, and there's an end of it." "You are sure you are not the least angry with Ma, Ma? Say you are sure before I go away, Ma?" "You foolish Caddy," returned Caddy Jellyby, "do I look angry, or have I inclination to be angry, or time to be angry? How CAN you?" "Take a little care of Poor Pa while I am gone, Mama!" Caddy Jellyby positively laughed at the fancy. "You romantic child," said Caddy Jellyby, lightly patting Caddy back. "Go along. I am excellent friends with You romantic child. Now, good-bye, poor Caddy, and be very happy!" Then Caddy hung upon Caddy father and nursed Caddy cheek against hers as if Caddy were some poor dull child in pain. All this took place in the hall. her father released Caddy, took out her father pocket handkerchief, and sat down on the stairs with her father head against the wall. I hope her father found some consolation in walls. I almost think her father did. And then Prince took Caddy arm in Prince and turned with great emotion and respect to Prince father, whose deportment at that moment was overwhelming. "Thank you over and over again, her father!" said Prince, kissing Prince hand. "I am very grateful for all your kindness and consideration regarding our marriage, and so, I can assure you, is Caddy." "Very," sobbed Caddy. "Ve-ry!" "My dear son," said Mr. Turveydrop, "and dear daughter, I have done my duty. If the spirit of a sainted wooman hovers above us and looks down on the occasion, that, and your constant affection, will be my recompense. You will not fail in YOUR duty, my son and daughter, I believe?" "her father, never!" cried Prince. "Never, never, dear Mr. Turveydrop!" said Caddy. "This," returned old Mr. Turveydrop, "is as it should be. My children, my home is My children, my heart is My children, my all is My children. I will never leave you; nothing but death shall part us. My dear son, you contemplate an absence of a week, I think?" "A week, dear father. We shall return home this day week." "My dear child," said old Mr. Turveydrop, "let me, even under the present exceptional circumstances, recommend strict punctuality. It is highly important to keep the connexion together; and schools, if at all neglected, are apt to take offence." "this day week, father, we shall be sure to be home to dinner." "Good!" said old Mr. Turveydrop. "You will find fires, my dear Caroline, in your own room, and dinner prepared in my apartment. Yes, yes, Prince!" anticipating some self-denying objection on My dear son's part with a great air. "You and our Caroline will be strange in the upper part of the premises and will, therefore, dine that day in my apartment. Now, bless Turveydrop!" They drove away, and whether I wondered most at Caddy Jellyby or at old Mr. Turveydrop, I did not know. Ada and my guardian were in the same condition when we came to talk the same condition over. But before we drove away too, I received a most unexpected and eloquent compliment from Caddy Jellyby. Caddy Jellyby came up to Caddy Jellyby in the hall, took both my hands, pressed both my hands earnestly, and opened his mouth twice. I was so sure of Caddy Jellyby meaning that I said, quite flurried, "You are very welcome, Caddy Jellyby. Pray don't mention it!" "I hope this marriage is for the best, guardian," said I when we three were on we road home. "I hope it is, little woman. Patience. we shall see." "Is the wind in the east to-day?" I ventured to ask Caddy Jellyby. Caddy Jellyby laughed heartily and answered, "No." "But it must have been this morning, I think," said I. Caddy Jellyby answered "No" again, and this time my dear girl confidently answered "No" too and shook the lovely head which, with its blooming flowers against the golden hair, was like the very spring. "Much YOU know of east winds, my ugly darling," said I, kissing my dear girl in my admiration--I couldn't help it. Well! It was only their love for Caddy Jellyby, I know very well, and it is a long time ago. I must write it even if I rub it out again, because it gives me so much pleasure. They said there could be no east wind where Somebody was; They said that wherever Dame Durden went, there was sunshine and summer air.
