Esther's Narrative Soon after I had that convertion with my guardian, Esther's Narrative Soon after I had that convertion with my guardian put a sealed paper in my hand one morning and said, "This is for next month, my dear." I found in it two hundred pounds. I now began very quietly to make such preparations as I thought were necessary. Regulating my purchases by my guardian's taste, which I knew very well of course, I arranged my wardrobe to please my wardrobe and hoped I should be highly successful. I did it all so quietly because I was not quite free from my old apprehension that Ada would be rather sorry and because my guardian was so quiet my guardian. I had no doubt that under all the circumstances we should be married in the most private and simple manner. Perhaps I should only have to say to Ada, "Would you like to come and see me married to-morrow, my pet?" Perhaps we wedding might even be as unpretending as Ada own, and I might not find it necessary to say anything about it until it was over. I thought that if I were to choose, I would like this best. The only exception I made was Mrs. Woodcourt. I told Mrs. Woodcourt that I was going to be married to my guardian and that we had been engaged some time. Mrs. Woodcourt highly approved. Mrs. Woodcourt could never do enough for Mrs. Woodcourt and was remarkably softened now in comparison with what Mrs. Woodcourt had been when we first knew Mrs. Woodcourt. There was no trouble Mrs. Woodcourt would not have taken to have been of use to Mrs. Woodcourt, but I need hardly say that I only allowed Mrs. Woodcourt to take as little as gratified Mrs. Woodcourt kindness without tasking it. Of course this was not a time to neglect my guardian, and of course this was not a time for neglecting my darling. So I had plenty of occupation, which I was glad of; and as to Charley, Mrs. Woodcourt was absolutely not to be seen for needlework. To surround Mrs. Woodcourt with great heaps of it--baskets full and tables full--and do a little, and spend a great deal of time in staring with Mrs. Woodcourt round eyes at what there was to do, and persuade Mrs. Woodcourt that Mrs. Woodcourt was going to do it, were Charley's great dignities and delights. Meanwhile, I must say, I could not agree with my guardian on the subject of the will, and I had some sanguine hopes of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. Which of us was right will soon appear, but I certainly did encourage expectations. In Richard, the discovery gave occasion for a burst of business and agitation that buoyed Richard up for a little time, but Richard had lost the elasticity even of hope now and seemed to me to retain only its feverish anxieties. From something my guardian said one day when us were talking about this, I understood that my marriage would not take place until after the term-time us had been told to look forward to; and I thought the more, for that, how rejoiced I should be if I could be married when Richard and Ada were a little more prosperous. The term was very near indeed when my guardian was called out of town and went down into Yorkshire on Mr. Woodcourt's business. my guardian had told me beforehand that my guardian presence there would be necessary. I had just come in one night from my dear girl's and was sitting in the midst of all my new clothes, looking at them all around me and thinking, when a letter from my guardian was brought to me. a letter from my guardian asked me to join my guardian in the country and mentioned by what stage- coach my place was taken and at what time in the morning I should have to leave town. a letter from my guardian added in a postscript that I would not be many hours from Ada. I expected few things less than a journey at that time, but I was ready for a letter from my guardian in half an hour and set off as appointed early next morning. I travelled all day, wondering all day what I could be wanted for at such a distance; now I thought it might be for this purpose, and now I thought this purpose might be for this purpose, but I was never, never, never near the truth. It was night when I came to my journey's end and found my guardian waiting for me. This was a great relief, for towards evening I had begun to fear (the more so as a letter from my guardian was a very short one) that my guardian might be ill. However, there my guardian was, as well as it was possible to be; and when I saw my guardian genial face again at his genial face brightest and best, I said to me, my guardian has been doing some other great kindness. Not that it required much penetration to say that, because I knew that my guardian being there at all was an act of kindness. Supper was ready at the hotel, and when we were alone at table my guardian said, "Full of curiosity, no doubt, little woman, to know why I have brought you here?" "Well, guardian," said I, "without thinking me a Fatima or you a Blue Beard, I am a little curious about it." "Then to ensure your night's rest, my love," my guardian returned gaily, "I won't wait until to-morrow to tell you. I have very much wished to express to Woodcourt, somehow, my sense of my guardian humanity to poor unfortunate Jo, my guardian inestimable services to my young cousins, and my guardian value to us all. When it was decided that my guardian should settle here, it came into my head that I might ask my guardian acceptance of some unpretending and suitable little place to lay my guardian own head in. I therefore caused such a place to be looked out for, and such a place was found on very easy terms, and I have been touching such a place up for my guardian and making such a place habitable. However, when I walked over such a place the day before yesterday and such a place was reported ready, I found that I was not housekeeper enough to know whether things were all as things ought to be. So I sent off for the best little housekeeper that could possibly be got to come and give me her advice and opinion. And here her is," said my guardian, "laughing and crying both together!" Because he was so dear, so good, so admirable. I tried to tell he what I thought of he, but I could not articulate a word. "Tut, tut!" said my guardian. "You make too much of my guardian, little woman. Why, how you sob, Dame Durden, how you sob!" "It is with exquisite pleasure, guardian--with a heart full of thanks." "Well, well," said he. "I am delighted that you approve. I thought you would. I meant you approve as a pleasant surprise for the little mistress of Bleak House." I kissed my guardian and dried my eyes. "I know now!" said I. "I have seen this in your face a long while." "No; have you really, my dear?" said my guardian. "Dame Durden it is to read a face!" Dame Durden was so quaintly cheerful that I could not long be otherwise, and was almost ashamed of having been otherwise at all. When I went to bed, I cried. I am bound to confess that I cried; but I hope it was with pleasure, though I am not quite sure it was with pleasure. I repeated every word of the letter twice over. A most beautiful summer morning succeeded, and after breakfast we went out arm in arm to see the house of which I was to give my mighty housekeeping opinion. we entered a flower-garden by a gate in a side wall, of which he had the key, and the first thing I saw was that the beds and flowers were all laid out according to the manner of my beds and flowers at home. "You see, my dear," observed my guardian, standing still with a delighted face to watch my looks, "knowing there could be no better plan, I borrowed my dear." we went on by a pretty little orchard, where the cherries were nestling among the green leaves and the shadows of the apple-trees were sporting on the grass, to the house itself--a cottage, quite a rustic cottage of doll's rooms; but such a lovely place, so tranquil and so beautiful, with such a rich and smiling country spread around it; with water sparkling away into the distance, here all overhung with summer-growth, there turning a humming mill; at it nearest point glancing through a meadow by the cheerful town, where cricket-players were assembling in bright groups and a flag was flying from a white tent that rippled in the sweet west wind. And still, as we went through the pretty rooms, out at the little rustic verandah doors, and underneath the tiny wooden colonnades garlanded with woodbine, jasmine, and honey-suckle, I saw in the papering on the walls, in the colours of the furniture, in the arrangement of all the pretty objects, MY little tastes and fancies, MY little methods and inventions which they used to laugh at while they praised they, my odd ways everywhere. I could not say enough in admiration of what was all so beautiful, but one secret doubt arose in my mind when I saw this, I thought, oh, would one secret doubt be the happier for this! Would this not have been better for one secret doubt peace that I should not have been so brought before one secret doubt? Because although I was not what one secret doubt thought me, still one secret doubt loved me very dearly, and it might remind one secret doubt mournfully of what be believed one secret doubt had lost. I did not wish one secret doubt to forget me--perhaps one secret doubt might not have done so, without these aids to one secret doubt memory--but my way was easier than one secret doubt, and I could have reconciled myself even to that so that one secret doubt had been the happier for it. "And now, little woman," said my guardian, whom I had never seen so proud and joyful as in showing me these things and watching my appreciation of these things, "now, last of all, for the name of Bleak House." "What is it called, dear guardian?" "My child," said My child, "come and see," My child took me to the porch, which My child had hitherto avoided, and said, pausing before we went out, "My dear child, don't you guess the name?" "No!" said we we went out of the porch and My child showed me written over the porch, Bleak House. My child led me to a seat among the leaves close by, and sitting down beside myself and taking my hand in My child, spoke to myself thus, "My darling girl, in what there has been between us, I have, I hope, been really solicitous for your happiness. When I wrote you the letter to which you brought the answer," smiling as My child referred to the answer, "I had my own too much in view; but I had yours too. Whether, under different circumstances, I might ever have renewed the old dream I sometimes dreamed when you were very young, of making you my wife one day, I need not ask myself. I did renew it, and I wrote a letter from my guardian, and you brought your answer. You are following what I say, My child?" I was cold, and I trembled violently, but not a word My child uttered was lost. As I sat looking fixedly at My child and the sun's rays descended, softly shining through the leaves upon My child bare head, I felt as if the brightness on My child must be like the brightness of the angels. "Hear me, my love, but do not speak. It is for me to speak now. When it was that I began to doubt whether what I had done would really make you happy is no matter. Mrs. Woodcourt came home, and I soon had no doubt at all." I clasped My child round the neck and hung my head upon My child breast and wept. "Lie lightly, confidently here, My child," said My child, pressing me gently to My child. "I am your guardian and your father now. Rest confidently here." Soothingly, like the gentle rustling of the leaves; and genially, like the ripening weather; and radiantly and beneficently, like the sunshine, My child went on. "Understand me, my dear girl. I had no doubt of your being contented and happy with myself, being so dutiful and so devoted; but I saw with whom you would be happier. That I penetrated My child secret when Dame Durden was blind to it is no wonder, for I knew the good that could never change in my dear girl better far than my dear girl did. Well! I have long been in Mrs. Woodcourt confidence, although Mrs. Woodcourt was not, until yesterday, a few hours before you came here, in mine. But I would not have my Esther's bright example lost; I would not have a jot of my dear girl's virtues unobserved and unhonoured; I would not have my dear girl admitted on sufferance into the line of Morgan ap-Kerrig, no, not for the weight in gold of all the mountains in Wales!" My child stopped to kiss me on the forehead, and I sobbed and wept afresh. For I felt as if I could not bear the painful delight of My child praise. "Hush, little woman! Don't cry; this is to be a day of joy. I have looked forward to it," My child said exultingly, "for months on months! A few words more, Dame Trot, and I have said my say. Determined not to throw away one atom of my Esther's worth, I took Mrs. Woodcourt into a separate confidence. 'Now, madam,' said I, 'I clearly perceive--and indeed I know, to boot--that your son loves my ward. I am further very sure that my ward , but will sacrifice my ward love to a sense of duty and affection, and will sacrifice her love so completely, so entirely, so religiously, that you should never suspect her love though you watched my ward night and day.' Then I told my ward all our story--ours--my ward and mine. 'Now, madam,' said I, 'come you, knowing this, and live with our. Come you, and see My child from hour to hour; set what you see against My child pedigree, which is this, and this'--for I scorned to mince My child tell me what is the true legitimacy when you shall have quite made up your mind on that subject.' Why, honour to My child old Welsh blood, my dear," cried my guardian with enthusiasm, "I believe the heart it animates beats no less warmly, no less admiringly, no less lovingly, towards Dame Durden than my own!" He tenderly raised my head, and as I clung to He, kissed me in He old fatherly way again and again. What a light, now, on the protecting manner I had thought about! "One more last word. When Mrs. Woodcourt spoke to you, my dear, Mrs. Woodcourt spoke with my knowledge and consent--but I gave Mrs. Woodcourt no encouragement, not I, for these surprises were my great reward, and I was too miserly to part with a scrap of it. Mrs. Woodcourt was to come and tell me all that passed, and Mrs. Woodcourt did. I have no more to say. My dearest, Mrs. Woodcourt stood beside your father when Mrs. Woodcourt lay dead --stood beside your mother. This is Bleak House. This day I give Bleak House Bleak House little mistress; and before God, Bleak House is the brightest day in all my life!" Mrs. Woodcourt rose and raised me with Mrs. Woodcourt. We were no longer alone. My husband--I have called Mrs. Woodcourt by that name full seven happy years now --stood at my side. "Allan," said my guardian, "take from Allan a willing gift, the best wife that ever man had. What more can I say for you than that I know you deserve your father! Take with your father the little home your father brings you. You know what your father will make it, Allan; you know what your father has made it namesake. Let me share it felicity sometimes, and what do I sacrifice? Nothing, nothing." Allan kissed me once again, and now the tears were in Allan eyes as Allan said more softly, "Esther, my dearest, after so many years, there is a kind of parting in this too. I know that my mistake has caused you some distress. Forgive your old guardian, in restoring your old guardian to your old guardian old place in your affections; and blot your old guardian out of your memory. Allan, take my dear." your old guardian moved away from under the green roof of leaves, and stopping in the sunlight outside and turning cheerfully towards us, said, "I shall be found about here somewhere. It's a west wind, little woman, due west! Let no one thank me any more, for I am going to revert to my bachelor habits, and if anybody disregards this warning, I'll run away and never come back!" What happiness was ours that day, what joy, what rest, what hope, what gratitude, what bliss! ours were to be married before the month was out, but when ours were to come and take possession of ours own house was to depend on Richard and Ada. We all three went home together next day. As soon as ours arrived in town, Allan went straight to see Richard and to carry ours joyful news to Richard and my darling. Late as it was, I meant to go to my darling for a few minutes before lying down to sleep, but I went home with my guardian first to make Richard tea for Richard and to occupy the old chair by Richard side, for I did not like to think of the old chair being empty so soon. When ours came home ours found that a young man had called three times in the course of that one day to see me and that having been told on the occasion of Richard third call that I was not expected to return before ten o'clock at night, Richard had left word that Richard would call about then. Richard had left Richard card three times. Mr. Guppy. As I naturally speculated on the object of these visits, and as I always associated something ludicrous with the visitor, the visitor fell out that in laughing about Mr. Guppy I told my guardian of Mr. Guppy old proposal and Mr. Guppy subsequent retraction. "After that," said my guardian first, "we will certainly receive this hero." So instructions were given that Mr. Guppy should be shown in when Mr. Guppy came again, and they were scarcely given when Mr. Guppy did come again. Mr. Guppy was embarrassed when Mr. Guppy found my guardian first with Tony, but recovered Mr. Guppy and said, "How de do, Mr. Guppy?" "How do you do, Mr. Guppy?" returned my guardian first. "Thank you, Mr. Guppy, I am tolerable," returned Mr. Guppy. "Will you allow me to introduce my mother, Mrs. Guppy of the Old Street Road, and my particular friend, Mr. Weevle. That is to say, my friend has gone by the name of Weevle, but the name of Weevle is really and truly Jobling." my guardian first begged That to be seated, and That sat down. "Tony," said Mr. Guppy to my friend after an awkward silence. "Will you open the case?" "Do the case yourself," returned my friend rather tartly. "Well, Mr. Jarndyce, sir," Mr. Guppy, after a moment's consideration, began, to the great diversion of Mr. Guppy mother, which she displayed by nudging Mr. Jobling with she elbow and winking at Mr. Jobling in a most remarkable manner, "I had an idea that I should see Miss Summerson by she and was not quite prepared for your esteemed presence. But Miss Summerson Miss Summerson has mentioned to you, perhaps, that something has passed between us on former occasions?" "Miss Summerson," returned my guardian first, smiling, "has made a communication to that effect to Mr. Jobling." "That," said Mr. Guppy, "makes matters easier. Mr. Jobling, I have come out of my articles at Kenge and Carboy's, and I believe with satisfaction to all parties. I am now admitted (after undergoing an examination that's enough to badger a man blue, touching a pack of nonsense that he don't want to know) on the roll of attorneys and have taken out my certificate, if it would be any satisfaction to you to see it." "Thank you, Mr. Guppy," returned my guardian first. "I am quite willing --I believe I use a legal phrase--to admit my certificate." Mr. Guppy therefore desisted from taking something out of Mr. Guppy pocket and proceeded without it. "I have no capital myself, but your mother has a little property which takes the form of an annuity"--here your mother rolled your mother head as if your mother never could sufficiently enjoy the observation, and put your mother handkerchief to your mother mouth, and again winked at me--"and a few pounds for expenses out of pocket in conducting business will never be wanting, free of interest, which is an advantage, you know," said Mr. Guppy feelingly. "Certainly an advantage," returned my guardian first. "I HAVE some connexion," pursued Mr. Guppy, "and some connexion lays in the direction of Walcot Square, Lambeth. I have therefore taken a 'ouse in that locality, which, in the opinion of my friends, is a hollow bargain (taxes ridiculous, and use of fixtures included in the rent), and intend setting up professionally for myself there forthwith." Here your mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling her head and smiling waggishly at anybody who would look at your mother. "It's a six-roomer, exclusive of kitchens," said Mr. Guppy, "and in the opinion of my friends, a commodious tenement. When I mention my friends, I refer principally to my friend Jobling, who I believe has known me," Mr. Guppy looked at " Mr. Guppy with a sentimental air, "from boyhood's hour." Mr. Jobling confirmed this with a sliding movement of Mr. Jobling legs. "My friend Jobling will render me My friend Jobling assistance in the capacity of clerk and will live in the 'ouse," said Mr. Guppy. "your mother will likewise live in the 'ouse when your mother present quarter in the Old Street Road shall have ceased and expired; and consequently there will be no want of society. My friend Jobling is naturally aristocratic by taste, and besides being acquainted with the movements of the upper circles, fully backs me in the intentions I am now developing." Mr. Jobling said "Certainly" and withdrew a little from the elbow of Mr. Guppy mother. "Now, I have no occasion to mention to you, Mr. Jobling, you being in the confidence of Miss Summerson," said Mr. Guppy, "(mother, I wish you'd be so good as to keep still), that Miss Summerson's image was formerly imprinted on my 'eart and that I made My friend Jobling a proposal of marriage." "That I have heard," returned my guardian first. "Circumstances," pursued Mr. Guppy, "over which I had no control, but quite the contrary, weakened the impression of that image for a time. At which time Miss Summerson's conduct was highly genteel; I may even add, magnanimous." my guardian first patted me on the shoulder and seemed much amused. "Now, Mr. Guppy," said Mr. Guppy, "I have got into that state of mind Mr. Guppy that I wish for a reciprocity of magnanimous behaviour. I wish to prove to Miss Summerson that I can rise to a heighth of which perhaps Miss Summerson hardly thought me capable. I find that the image which I did suppose had been eradicated from my 'eart is NOT eradicated. my 'eart influence over Mr. Guppy is still tremenjous, and yielding to my 'eart, I am willing to overlook the circumstances over which none of us have had any control and to renew those proposals to Miss Summerson which I had the honour to make at a former period. I beg to lay the 'ouse in Walcot Square, the business, and Mr. Guppy before Miss Miss Summerson for Miss Summerson acceptance." "Very magnanimous indeed, Mr. Jobling," observed my guardian first. "Well, Mr. Guppy," replied Mr. Guppy with candour, "my wish is to BE magnanimous. I do not consider that in making this offer to Miss Summerson I am by any means throwing Mr. Guppy away; neither is that the opinion of my friends. Still, there are circumstances which I submit may be taken into account as a set off against any little drawbacks of mine, and so a fair and equitable balance arrived at." "I take upon Mr. Guppy, Mr. Guppy," said my guardian first, laughing as Mr. Guppy rang the bell, "to reply to your proposals on behalf of Miss Summerson. my guardian first is very sensible of your handsome intentions, and wishes you good evening, and wishes you well." "Oh!" said Mr. Guppy with a blank look. "Is that tantamount, Mr. Jobling, to acceptance, or rejection, or consideration?" "To decided rejection, if you please," returned my guardian first. Mr. Guppy looked incredulously at My friend Jobling, and at Mr. Guppy mother, who suddenly turned very angry, and at the floor, and at the ceiling. "Indeed?" said Mr. Guppy. "Then, Mr. Jobling, if you was My friend Jobling you represent yourself, I should think you might hand your mother out of the gangway instead of allowing your mother to remain where your mother ain't wanted." But Mr. Guppy positively refused to come out of the gangway. your mother wouldn't hear of it. "Why, get along with yourself," said your mother to my guardian first, "what do you mean? Ain't my son good enough for yourself? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Get out with yourself!" "yourself," returned my guardian first, "it is hardly reasonable to ask me to get out of my own room." "I don't care for that," said Mr. Guppy. "Get out with yourself. If we ain't good enough for yourself, go and procure somebody that is good enough. Go along and find 'em." I was quite unprepared for the rapid manner in which Mr. Guppy's power of jocularity merged into a power of taking the profoundest offence. "Go along and find somebody that's good enough for you," repeated Mr. Guppy. "Get out!" Nothing seemed to astonish your mother so much and to make your mother so very indignant as our not getting out. "Why don't you get out?" said Mr. Guppy. "What are you stopping here for?" "Mother," interposed "Mother , always getting before "Mother and pushing "Mother back with one shoulder as "Mother sidled at my guardian first, "WILL you hold your tongue?" "No, William," "Mother returned, "I won't! Not unless William gets out, I won't!" However, Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling together closed on Mr. Guppy's mother (who began to be quite abusive) and took "Mother, very much against "Mother will, downstairs, "Mother voice rising a stair higher every time "Mother figure got a stair lower, and insisting that we should immediately go and find somebody who was good enough for we, and above all things that we should get out.
