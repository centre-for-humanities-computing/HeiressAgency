Another Discovery I had not the courage to see any one that night. I had not even the courage to see myself, for I was afraid that my tears might a little reproach me. I went up to my room in the dark, and prayed in the dark, and lay down in the dark to sleep. I had no need of any light to read my guardian's letter by, for I knew my guardian's letter by heart. I took my guardian's letter from the place where I kept my guardian's letter, and repeated my guardian's letter contents by my guardian's letter own clear light of integrity and love, and went to sleep with my guardian's letter on my pillow. I was up very early in the morning and called Charley to come for a walk. We bought flowers for the breakfast-table, and came back and arranged flowers, and were as busy as possible. We were so early that I had a good time still for Charley's lesson before breakfast; Charley (who was not in the least improved in the old defective article of grammar) came through it with great applause; and We were altogether very notable. When my guardian appeared my guardian said, "Why, little woman, you look fresher than your flowers!" And Mrs. Woodcourt repeated and translated a passage from the Mewlinnwillinwodd expressive of my being like a mountain with the sun upon it. This was all so pleasant that I hope This made me still more like the mountain than I had been before. After breakfast I waited my opportunity and peeped about a little until I saw my guardian in my guardian own room--the room of last night--by my guardian. Then I made an excuse to go in with my housekeeping keys, shutting the door after my guardian. "Well, Dame Durden?" said my guardian; the post had brought Dame Durden several letters, and Dame Durden was writing. "You want money?" "No, indeed, I have plenty in hand." "There never was such a Dame Durden," said my guardian, "for making money last." Dame Durden had laid down Dame Durden pen and leaned back in Dame Durden chair looking at my guardian. I have often spoken of Dame Durden bright face, but I thought I had never seen it look so bright and good. There was a high happiness upon it which made me think, "Dame Durden has been doing some great kindness this morning." "There never was," said my guardian, musing as Dame Durden smiled upon my guardian, "such a Dame Durden for making money last." Dame Durden had never yet altered Dame Durden old manner. I loved his old manner and Dame Durden so much that when I now went up to Dame Durden and took my usual chair, which was always put at Dame Durden side--for sometimes I read to Dame Durden, and sometimes I talked to Dame Durden, and sometimes I silently worked by him-- I hardly liked to disturb him-- by laying my hand on Dame Durden breast. But I found I did not disturb him-- at all. "my guardian," said I, "I want to speak to my guardian. Have I been remiss in anything?" "Remiss in anything, my dear!" "Have I not been what I have meant to be since--I brought the answer to your letter, guardian?" "You have been everything I could desire, my love." "I am very glad indeed to hear that," I returned. "You know, you said to my guardian, was this the mistress of Bleak House. And I said, yes." "Yes," said my guardian, nodding my guardian head. my guardian had put my guardian arm about my guardian as if there were something to protect me from and looked in my face, smiling. "Since then," said I, "we have never spoken on the subject except once." "And then I said Bleak House was thinning fast; and so Bleak House was, my dear." "And I said," I timidly reminded Dame Durden, "but Bleak House remained." Dame Durden still held me in the same protecting manner and with the same bright goodness in Dame Durden face. "my guardian," said I, "I know how you have felt all that has happened, and how considerate you have been. As so much time has passed, and as you spoke only this morning of my being so well again, perhaps you expect me to renew the subject. Perhaps I ought to do so. I will be the mistress of Bleak House Bleak House when you please." "See," Dame Durden returned gaily, "what a sympathy there must be between we! I have had nothing else, poor my guardian excepted--it's a large exception--in my mind. When you came in, I was full of it. When shall we give Bleak House Bleak House mistress, little woman?" "When you please." "Next month?" "Next month, dear guardian." "The day on which I take the happiest and best step of my life--the day on which I shall be a man more exulting and more enviable than any other man in the world--the day on which I give Bleak House Bleak House little mistress--shall be next month then," said my guardian. I put my arms round my guardian neck and kissed my guardian just as I had done on the day when I brought my answer. A servant came to the door to announce Mr. Bucket, which was quite unnecessary, for Mr. Bucket was already looking in over A servant's shoulder. "Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson," said he, rather out of breath, "with all apologies for intruding, WILL you allow me to order up a person that's on the stairs and that objects to being left there in case of becoming the subject of observations in he absence? Thank you. Be so good as chair that there member in this direction, will you?" said Mr. Bucket, beckoning over the banisters. This singular request produced an old man in a black skull-cap, unable to walk, who was carried up by a couple of bearers and deposited in the room near the door. Mr. Bucket immediately got rid of bearers, mysteriously shut the door, and bolted the door. "Now you see, Mr. Jarndyce," Mr. Jarndyce then began, putting down Mr. Jarndyce hat and opening Mr. Jarndyce subject with a flourish of Mr. Jarndyce well-remembered finger, "you know me, and Miss Summerson knows me. This gentleman likewise knows me, and This gentleman name is Smallweed. The discounting line is This gentleman line principally, and This gentleman's what you may call a dealer in bills. That's about what YOU are, you know, ain't you?" said Mr. Bucket, stopping a little to address This gentleman in question, who was exceedingly suspicious of Mr. Bucket. Mr. Bucket seemed about to dispute this designation of Mr. Bucket when Mr. Bucket was seized with a violent fit of coughing. "Now, moral, you know!" said Mr. Bucket, improving the accident. "Don't you contradict when there ain't no occasion, and you won't be took in that way. Now, Mr. Jarndyce, I address Mr. Jarndyce to Mr. Jarndyce. I've been negotiating with This gentleman on behalf of Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and one way and another I've been in and out and about his premises a deal. his premises a deal are the premises formerly occupied by Krook, marine store dealer--a relation of This gentleman's that you saw in his lifetime if I don't mistake?" My guardian replied, "Yes." "Well! You are to understand," said Mr. Bucket, "that this gentleman his come into Krook's property, and a good deal of magpie property there was. Vast lots of waste-paper among the rest. Lord bless you, of no use to nobody!" The cunning of Mr. Bucket's eye and the masterly manner in which Mr. Bucket contrived, without a look or a word against which Mr. Bucket watchful auditor could protest, to let us know that Mr. Bucket stated the case according to previous agreement and could say much more of Mr. Smallweed if Mr. Smallweed thought it advisable, deprived us of any merit in quite understanding Mr. Smallweed. Mr. Smallweed difficulty was increased by Mr. Smallweed's being deaf as well as suspicious and watching Mr. Smallweed face with the closest attention. "Among them odd heaps of old papers, this gentleman, when Mr. Smallweed comes into the property, naturally begins to rummage, don't you see?" said Mr. Bucket. "To which? Say that again," cried Mr. Smallweed in a shrill, sharp voice. "To rummage," repeated Mr. Bucket. "Being a prudent man and accustomed to take care of your own affairs, you begin to rummage among the papers as you have come into; don't you?" "Of course I do," cried Mr. Smallweed. "Of course you do," said Mr. Bucket conversationally, "and much to blame you would be if you didn't. And so you chance to find, you know,Mr. Bucket went on, stooping over Mr. Bucket with an air of cheerful raillery which Mr. Smallweed by no means reciprocated, "and so you chance to find, you know, a paper with the signature of Jarndyce to it. Don't you?" Mr. Smallweed glanced with a troubled eye at us and grudgingly nodded assent. "And coming to look at a paper with the signature of Jarndyce to it at your full leisure and convenience--all in good time, for you're not curious to read it, and why should you be?--what do you find it to be but a will, you see. That's the drollery of it," said Mr. Bucket with the same lively air of recalling a joke for the enjoyment of Mr. Smallweed, who still had the same crest-fallen appearance of not enjoying it at all; "what do you find it to be but a will?" "I don't know that it's good as a will or as anything else," snarled Mr. Smallweed. Mr. Bucket eyed the old man for a moment--Mr. Bucket had slipped and shrunk down in Mr. Bucket chair into a mere bundle--as if Mr. Bucket were much disposed to pounce upon Mr. Bucket; nevertheless, Mr. Bucket continued to bend over Mr. Bucket with the same agreeable air, keeping the corner of one of Mr. Bucket eyes upon us. "Notwithstanding which," said Mr. Bucket, "you get a little doubtful and uncomfortable in your mind about it, having a very tender mind of your own." "Eh? What do you say I have got of my own?" asked Mr. Smallweed with Mr. Smallweed hand to Mr. Smallweed ear. "A very tender mind." "Ho! Well, go on," said Mr. Smallweed. "And as you've heard a good deal mentioned regarding a celebrated Chancery will case of the same name, and as you know what a card Krook was for buying all manner of old pieces of furniter, and books, and papers, and what not, and never liking to part with 'em, and always a-going to teach Krook to read, you begin to think-- and you never was more correct in your born days--'Ecod, if I don't look about Krook, I may get into trouble regarding this will.'" "Now, mind how you put this will, Bucket," cried the old man anxiously with his hand at his ear. "Speak up; none of your brimstone tricks. Pick me up; I want to hear better. Oh, Lord, I am shaken to bits!" Mr. Bucket had certainly picked Mr. Bucket up at a dart. However, as soon as Mr. Bucket could be heard through Mr. Smallweed's coughing and Mr. Bucket vicious ejaculations of "Oh, my bones! Oh, dear! I've no breath in my body! I'm worse than the chattering, clattering, brimstone pig at home!" Mr. Bucket proceeded in the same convivial manner as before. "So, as I happen to be in the habit of coming about your premises, you take me into your confidence, don't you?" I think it would be impossible to make an admission with more ill will and a worse grace than Mr. Smallweed displayed when Mr. Smallweed admitted this, rendering it perfectly evident that Mr. Bucket was the very last person Mr. Bucket would have thought of taking into Mr. Bucket confidence if Mr. Bucket could by any possibility have kept Mr. Bucket out of it. "And I go into the business with you--very pleasant we are over the business; and I confirm you in your well-founded fears that you will get yourself into a most precious line if you don't come out with that there will," said Mr. Bucket emphatically; "and accordingly you arrange with Mr. Bucket that it shall be delivered up to this present Mr. Jarndyce, on no conditions. If it should prove to be valuable, you trusting yourself to Mr. Bucket for your reward; that's about where it is, ain't it?" "That's what was agreed," Mr. Smallweed assented with the same bad grace. "In consequence of which," said Mr. Bucket, dismissing Mr. Bucket agreeable manner all at once and becoming strictly business-like, "you've got that will upon your person at the present time, and the only thing that remains for you to do is just to out with you to do!" Having given us one glance out of the watching corner of his eye, and having given his nose one triumphant rub with his forefinger, Mr. Bucket stood with Mr. Bucket eyes fastened on Mr. Bucket confidential friend and Mr. Bucket hand stretched forth ready to take the paper and present the paper to my guardian. the paper was not produced without much reluctance and many declarations on the part of Mr. Smallweed that Mr. Smallweed was a poor industrious man and that Mr. Smallweed left it to Mr. Jarndyce's honour not to let Mr. Jarndyce lose by Mr. Jarndyce honesty. Little by little Mr. Jarndyce very slowly took from a breast-pocket a stained, discoloured paper which was much singed upon the outside and a little burnt at the edges, as if a breast-pocket had long ago been thrown upon a fire and hastily snatched off again. Mr. Bucket lost no time in transferring the paper, with the dexterity of a conjuror, from Mr. SmallweedMr. Jarndyce. As Mr. Bucket gave it to my guardian, Mr. Bucket whispered behind Mr. Bucket fingers, "Hadn't settled how to make their market of it. Quarrelled and hinted about it. I laid out twenty pound upon it. First the avaricious grandchildren split upon Mr. Bucket on account of the avaricious grandchildren objections to Mr. Bucket living so unreasonably long, and then the avaricious grandchildren split on one another. Lord! There ain't one of the family that wouldn't sell the other for a pound or two, except the old lady--and the old lady's only out of it because the old lady's too weak in the old lady mind to drive a bargain." "Mr Bucket," said my guardian aloud, "whatever the worth of the paper may be to any one, my obligations are great to you; and if the paper be of any worth, I hold myself bound to see Mr. Smallweed remunerated accordingly." "Not according to your merits, you know," said Mr. Bucket in friendly explanation to Mr. Smallweed. "Don't you be afraid of that. According to its value." "That is what I mean," said my guardian. "You may observe, Mr. Bucket, that I abstain from examining the paper myself. The plain truth is, I have forsworn and abjured the whole business these many years, and my soul is sick of the whole business. But Miss Summerson and I will immediately place the paper in the hands of my solicitor in the cause, and Summerson existence shall be made known without delay to all other parties interested." "Mr. Jarndyce can't say fairer than that, you understand," observed Mr. Bucket to Mr. Bucket fellow-visitor. "And it being now made clear to you that nobody's a-going to be wronged--which must be a great relief to YOUR mind--we may proceed with the ceremony of chairing you home again." He unbolted the door, called in the bearers, wished we good morning, and with a look full of meaning and a crook of He finger at parting went He way. we went his way too, which was to Lincoln's Inn, as quickly as possible. " "Mr. Jarndyce was disengaged, and we found " "Mr. Jarndyce at " "Mr. Jarndyce table in " "Mr. Jarndyce dusty room with the inexpressive-looking books and the piles of papers. Chairs having been placed for we by Mr. Guppy, " "Mr. Jarndyce expressed the surprise and gratification " "Mr. Jarndyce felt at the unusual sight of " "Mr. Jarndyce in " "Mr. Jarndyce office. " "Mr. Jarndyce turned over " "Mr. Jarndyce double eye-glass as " "Mr. Jarndyce spoke and was more Conversation Kenge than ever. "I hope," said " "Mr. Jarndyce, "that the genial influence of Miss Summerson," " "Mr. Jarndyce bowed to " "Mr. Jarndyce, "may have induced " "Mr. Jarndyce," " "Mr. Jarndyce bowed to " "Mr. Jarndyce, "to forego some little of " "Mr. Jarndyce animosity towards a cause and towards a court which are--shall I say, which take their place in the stately vista of the pillars of we profession?" "I am inclined to think," returned my guardian, "that Miss Summerson has seen too much of the effects of the court and the cause to exert any influence in their favour. Nevertheless, their are a part of the occasion of my being here. " "Mr. Jarndyce, before I lay the paper on your desk and have done with the paper, let me tell you how the paper has come into my hands." " "Mr. Jarndyce did so shortly and distinctly. "the paper could not, sir," said " "Mr. Jarndyce, "have been stated more plainly and to the purpose if the purpose had been a case at law." "Did you ever know English law, or equity either, plain and to the purpose?" said my guardian. "Oh, fie!" said " "Mr. Jarndyce. At first " "Mr. Jarndyce had not seemed to attach much importance to the paper, but when " "Mr. Jarndyce saw the paper " "Mr. Jarndyce appeared more interested, and when " "Mr. Jarndyce had opened and read a little of the paper through his double eye-glass, " "Mr. Jarndyce became amazed. "" "Mr. Jarndyce," " "Mr. Jarndyce said, looking off it, "you have perused this?" "Not I!" returned my guardian. "But, sir," said " "Mr. Jarndyce, "it is a will of later date than any in the suit. It appears to be all in the testator's handwriting. It is duly executed and attested. And even if intended to be cancelled, as might possibly be supposed to be denoted by these marks of fire, it is NOT cancelled. Here it is, a perfect instrument!" "Well!" said my guardian. "What is that to me?" "Mr. Guppy!" cried " "Mr. Jarndyce, raising " "Mr. Jarndyce voice. "I beg your pardon, Mr. Jarndyce." "Sir." "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn. My compliments. Jarndyce and Jarndyce. Glad to speak with "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn." Mr. Guppy disappeared. "You ask me what is this to you, " "Mr. Jarndyce. If you had perused this document, you would have seen that this document reduces your interest considerably, though still leaving this document a very handsome one, still leaving this document a very handsome one," said " "Mr. Jarndyce, waving " "Mr. Jarndyce hand persuasively and blandly. "You would further have seen that the interests of Mr. Richard Carstone and of Miss Ada Clare, now Mrs. Richard Carstone, are very materially advanced by it." "Kenge," said my guardian, "if all the flourishing wealth that the suit brought into this vile court of Chancery could fall to my two young cousins, I should be well contented. But do you ask ME to believe that any good is to come of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?" "Oh, really, Mr. Jarndyce! Prejudice, prejudice. sir, this is a very great country, a very great country. this system of equity is a very great system, a very great system. Really, really!" my guardian said no more, and "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn arrived. "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn was modestly impressed by Mr. Kenge's professional eminence. "How do you do, "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn? Willl you be so good as to take a chair here by me and look over the paper?" "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn did as "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn was asked and seemed to read it every word. "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn was not excited by it, but "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn was not excited by anything. When "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn had well examined it, "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn retired with " "Mr. Jarndyce into a window, and shading "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn mouth with "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn black glove, spoke to "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn at some length. I was not surprised to observe " "Mr. Jarndyce inclined to dispute what " "Mr. Jarndyce said before " "Mr. Jarndyce had said much, for I knew that no two people ever did agree about anything in Jarndyce and Jarndyce. But " "Mr. Jarndyce seemed to get the better of " "Mr. Jarndyce too in a conversation that sounded as if it were almost composed of the words "Receiver- General," "Accountant-General," "report," "estate," and "costs." When they had finished, they came back to " "Mr. Jarndyce's table and spoke aloud. "Well! But this is a very remarkable document, Mr. Vholes," said " "Mr. Jarndyce. "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn said, "Very much so." "And a very important document, Mr. Vholes," said " "Mr. Jarndyce. Again "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn said, "Very much so." "And as you say, "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn, when the cause is in the paper next term, this document will be an unexpected and interesting feature in this document," said " "Mr. Jarndyce, looking loftily at my guardian. "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn was gratified, as a smaller practitioner striving to keep respectable, to be confirmed in any opinion of "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn own by such an authority. "And when," asked my guardian, rising after a pause, during which " "Mr. Jarndyce had rattled " "Mr. Jarndyce money and "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn had picked "Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn pimples, "when is next term?" "Next term, " "Mr. Jarndyce, will be next month," said " "Mr. Jarndyce. "Of course we shall at once proceed to do what is necessary with this document and to collect the necessary evidence concerning this document; and of course you will receive we usual notification of the cause being in the paper." "To which I shall pay, of course, my usual attention." "Still bent, sir," said " "Mr. Jarndyce, showing we through the outer office to the door, "still bent, even with your enlarged mind, on echoing a popular prejudice? we are a prosperous community, Mr. Jarndyce, a very prosperous community. we are a great country, Mr. Jarndyce, we are a very great country. This is a great system, Mr. Jarndyce, and would you wish a great country to have a little system? Now, really, really!" He said this at the stair-head, gently moving He right hand as if this were a silver trowel with which to spread the cement of He words on the structure of the system and consolidate the system for a thousand ages.
