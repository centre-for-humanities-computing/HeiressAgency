Esther's Narrative It matters little now how much I thought of my living mother who had told me evermore to consider Esther's Narrative dead. I could not venture to approach Esther's Narrative or to communicate with Esther's Narrative in writing, for my sense of the peril in which Esther's Narrative life was passed was only to be equalled by my fears of increasing my sense of the peril in which her life was passed. Knowing that my mere existence as a living creature was an unforeseen danger in Esther's Narrative way, I could not always conquer that terror of myself which had seized me when I first knew the secret. At no time did I dare to utter Esther's Narrative name. I felt as if I did not even dare to hear her name. If the conversation anywhere, when I was present, took that direction, as it sometimes naturally did, I tried not to hear: I mentally counted, repeated something that I knew, or went out of the room. I am conscious now that I often did these things when there can have been no danger of Esther's Narrative being spoken of, but I did these things in the dread I had of hearing anything that might lead to Esther's Narrative betrayal, and to her betrayal through myself. It matters little now how often I recalled the tones of my mother's voice, wondered whether I should ever hear It again as I so longed to do, and thought how strange and desolate It was that It should be so new to myself. It matters little that I watched for every public mention of my mother's name; that I passed and repassed the door of my mother house in town, loving it, but afraid to look at it; that I once sat in the theatre when my mother was there and saw me, and when we were so wide asunder before the great company of all degrees that any link or confidence between we seemed a dream. It is all, all over. My lot has been so blest that I can relate little of myself which is not a story of goodness and generosity in others. I may well pass that little and go on. When we were settled at home again, Ada and I had many conversations with my guardian of which Richard was the theme. My dear girl was deeply grieved that Richard should do their kind cousin so much wrong, but My dear girl was so faithful to Richard that My dear girl could not bear to blame Richard even for that. my guardian of which was assured of my guardian of which, and never coupled my guardian of which name with a word of reproof. "Rick is mistaken, my dear," Rick would say to My dear girl. "Well, well! we have all been mistaken over and over again. we must trust to you and time to set Rick right." we knew afterwards what we suspected then, that Rick did not trust to time until Rick had often tried to open Richard's eyes. That Rick had written to Rick, gone to Rick, talked with Rick, tried every gentle and persuasive art Rick kindness could devise. Richard Richard was deaf and blind to all. If Richard were wrong, Richard would make amends when the Chancery suit was over. If Richard were groping in the dark, Richard could not do better than do Richard utmost to clear away those clouds in which so much was confused and obscured. Suspicion and misunderstanding were the fault of the Chancery suit? Then let Richard work the Chancery suit out and come through the Chancery suit to Richard right mind. This was Richard unvarying reply. Jarndyce and Jarndyce had obtained such possession of Jarndyce whole nature that it was impossible to place any consideration before Jarndyce which Jarndyce did not, with a distorted kind of reason, make a new argument in favour of Jarndyce doing what Jarndyce did. "So that it is even more mischievous," said my guardian once to me, "to remonstrate with the poor dear fellow than to leave my guardian alone." I took one of these opportunities of mentioning my doubts of Mr. Skimpole as a good adviser for Richard. "Adviser!" returned my guardian, laughing, "My dear, who would advise with Skimpole?" "Encourager would perhaps have been a better word," said I. "Encourager!" returned my guardian again. "Who could be encouraged by Skimpole?" "Not Richard?" I asked. "No," Richard replied. "Such an unworldly, uncalculating, gossamer creature is a relief to Richard and an amusement. But as to advising or encouraging or occupying a serious station towards anybody or anything, it is simply not to be thought of in such a child as Skimpole." "Pray, cousin John," said Ada, who had just joined us and now looked over my shoulder, "what made Richard such a child?" "What made him such a child?" inquired my guardian, rubbing Richard head, a little at a loss. "Yes, cousin John." "Why," Richard slowly replied, roughening his head more and more, "Richard is all sentiment, and--and susceptibility, and--and sensibility, and-- and imagination. And these qualities are not regulated in Richard, somehow. I suppose the people who admired Richard for these qualities in Richard youth attached too much importance to these qualities and too little to any training that would have balanced and adjusted these qualities, and so Richard became what Richard is. Hey?" said my guardian, stopping short and looking at us hopefully. "What do you think, you two?" Ada, glancing at me, said " Ada thought it was a pity Richard should be an expense to Richard. "So it is, so it is," returned my guardian hurriedly. "That must not be. us must arrange that. I must prevent that. That will never do." And I said I thought it was to be regretted that Richard had ever introduced Richard to Mr. Vholes for a present of five pounds. "Did Richard?" said my guardian with a passing shade of vexation on Richard face. "But there you have Richard. There you have Richard! There is nothing mercenary in that with Richard. Richard has no idea of the value of money. Richard introduces Rick, and then Richard is good friends with Mr. Vholes and borrows five pounds of Mr. Vholes. Richard means nothing by it and thinks nothing of it. Richard told you Richard, I'll be bound, my dear?" "Oh, yes!" said I. "Exactly!" cried my guardian, quite triumphant. "There you have Richard! If Richard had meant any harm by it or was conscious of any harm in it, Richard wouldn't tell it. Richard tells it as Richard does it in mere simplicity. But you shall see Richard in Richard own home, and then you'll understand Richard better. We must pay a visit to Harold Skimpole and caution Richard on these points. Lord bless you, my dears, an infant, an infant!" In pursuance of this plan, We went into London on an early day and presented We at Harold Skimpole's door. Harold Skimpole lived in a place called the Polygon, in Somers Town, where there were at that time a number of poor Spanish refugees walking about in cloaks, smoking little paper cigars. Whether Harold Skimpole was a better tenant than one might have supposed, in consequence of Harold Skimpole friend Somebody always paying his friend rent at last, or whether his friend inaptitude for business rendered it particularly difficult to turn his friend out, I don't know; but his friend had occupied the same house some years. It was in a state of dilapidation quite equal to our expectation. Two or three of the area railings were gone, the water-butt was broken, the knocker was loose, the bell-handle had been pulled off a long time to judge from the rusty state of the wire, and dirty footprints on the steps were the only signs of the knocker being inhabited. A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry answered A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry knock by opening the door a very little way and stopping up the gap with her figure. As her knew Mr. Jarndyce (indeed Ada and I both thought that her evidently associated Mr. Jarndyce with the receipt of her wages), her immediately relented and allowed A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry to pass in. The lock of the door being in a disabled condition, her then applied her to securing The lock of the door with the chain, which was not in good action either, and said would A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry go upstairs? A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry went upstairs to the first floor, still seeing no other furniture than the dirty footprints. Mr. Jarndyce without further ceremony entered a room there, and A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry followed. It was dingy enough and not at all clean, but furnished with an odd kind of shabby luxury, with a large footstool, a sofa, and plenty of cushions, an easy-chair, and plenty of pillows, a piano, books, drawing materials, music, newspapers, and a few sketches and pictures. A broken pane of glass in one of the dirty windows was papered and wafered over, but there was a little plate of hothouse nectarines on the table, and there was another of grapes, and another of sponge-cakes, and there was a bottle of light wine. Harold Skimpole reclined upon the sofa in a dressing-gown, drinking some fragrant coffee from an old china cup--it was then about mid-day--and looking at a collection of wallflowers in the balcony. Harold Skimpole was not in the least disconcerted by A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry appearance, but rose and received A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry in Harold Skimpole usual airy manner. "Here I am, you see!" Harold Skimpole said when A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry were seated, not without some little difficulty, the greater part of the chairs being broken. "Here I am! This is my frugal breakfast. Some men want legs of beef and mutton for breakfast; I don't. Give me my peach, my cup of coffee, and my claret; I am content. I don't want my peach, my cup of coffee, and my claret for my peach, my cup of coffee, and my claret, but my peach, my cup of coffee, and my claret remind me of the sun. There's nothing solar about legs of beef and mutton. Mere animal satisfaction!" "This is A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry friend's consulting-room (or would be, if our friend ever prescribed), our friend sanctum, our friend studio," said my guardian to A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry. "Yes," said Harold Skimpole, turning Harold Skimpole bright face about, "this is the bird's cage. This is where the bird lives and sings. They pluck Harold Skimpole feathers now and then and clip Harold Skimpole wings, but Harold Skimpole sings, Harold Skimpole sings!" Harold Skimpole handed A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry the grapes, repeating in Harold Skimpole radiant way, "Harold Skimpole sings! Not an ambitious note, but still Harold Skimpole sings." "These are very fine," said my guardian. "A present?" "No," Harold Skimpole answered. "No! Some amiable gardener sells Some amiable gardener. Harold Skimpole man wanted to know, when His man brought Some amiable gardener last evening, whether His man should wait for the money. 'Really, my friend,' I said, 'I think not--if your time is of any value to you.' I suppose it was, for His man went away." my guardian looked at A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry with a smile, as though my guardian asked A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry, "Is it possible to be worldly with this baby?" "This is a day," said Harold Skimpole, gaily taking a little claret in a tumbler, "that will ever be remembered here. A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry shall call it Saint Clare and Saint Summerson day. You must see my daughters. I have a blue-eyed daughter who is my Beauty daughter, I have a Sentiment daughter, and I have a Comedy daughter. You must see them all. them all'll be enchanted." He was going to summon them all when my guardian interposed and asked He to pause a moment, as He wished to say a word to He first. "My dear Jarndyce," He cheerfully replied, going back to He sofa, "as many moments as you please. Time is no object here. A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry never know what o'clock it is, and A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry never care. Not the way to get on in life, you'll tell me? Certainly. But A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry DON'T get on in life. A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry don't pretend to do it." my guardian looked at A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry again, plainly saying, "You hear my guardian?" "Now, Harold," my guardian began, "the word I have to say relates to Rick." "The dearest friend I have!" returned Harold Skimpole cordially. "I suppose Harold Skimpole ought not to be my dearest friend, as Harold Skimpole is not on terms with my dearest friend. But Harold Skimpole is, I can't help it; Harold Skimpole is full of youthful poetry, and I love Harold Skimpole. If you don't like it, I can't help it. I love Harold Skimpole." The engaging frankness with which Harold Skimpole made this declaration really had a disinterested appearance and captivated my guardian, if not, for the moment, Ada too. "You are welcome to love Harold Skimpole as much as you like," returned Mr. Jarndyce, "but we must save Harold Skimpole pocket, Harold." "Oh!" said Harold Skimpole. "Harold Skimpole pocket? Now you are coming to what I don't understand." Taking a little more claret and dipping one of the cakes in it, Harold Skimpole shook Harold Skimpole and smiled at Ada and me with an ingenuous foreboding that Harold Skimpole never could be made to understand. "If you go with Harold Skimpole here or there," said my guardian plainly, "you must not let Harold Skimpole pay for both." "My dear Jarndyce," returned Mr. Skimpole, Harold Skimpole genial face irradiated by the comicality of this idea, "what am I to do? If Harold Skimpole takes me anywhere, I must go. And how can I pay? I never have any money. If I had any money, I don't know anything about any money. Suppose I say to a man, how much? Suppose a man says to a man seven and sixpence? I know nothing about seven and sixpence. It is impossible for me to pursue the subject with any consideration for a man. I don't go about asking busy people what seven and sixpence is in Moorish--which I don't understand. Why should I go about asking busy people what seven and sixpence is in Money--which I don't understand?" "Well," said my guardian, by no means displeased with this artless reply, "if you come to any kind of journeying with Rick, you must borrow the money of a man (never breathing the least allusion to that circumstance), and leave the calculation to Rick." "My dear Jarndyce," returned Harold Skimpole, "I will do anything to give you pleasure, but it seems an idle form--a superstition. Besides, I give you my word, Miss Clare and my dear Miss Summerson, I thought Mr. Carstone was immensely rich. I thought Mr. Carstone had only to make over something, or to sign a bond, or a draft, or a cheque, or a bill, or to put something on a file somewhere, to bring down a shower of money." "Indeed it is not so, sir," said Ada. "sir is poor." "No, really?" returned Harold Skimpole with sir bright smile. "You surprise me. "And not being the richer for trusting in a rotten reed," said my guardian, laying my guardian hand emphatically on the sleeve of Harold Skimpole's dressing-gown, "be you very careful not to encourage my guardian in that reliance, Harold." "My dear good friend," returned Harold Skimpole, "and my dear Miss Simmerson, and my dear Miss Clare, how can I do that? It's business, and I don't know business. It is my guardian who encourages me. my guardian emerges from great feats of business, presents the brightest prospects before me as the brightest prospects result, and calls upon me to admire the brightest prospects. I do admire the brightest prospects--as bright prospects. But I know no more about the brightest prospects, and I tell my guardian so." The helpless kind of candour with which he presented this before us, the light-hearted manner in which he was amused by he innocence, the fantastic way in which he took he under he own protection and argued about that curious person, combined with the delightful ease of everything he said exactly to make out my guardian's case. The more I saw of he, The more unlikely it seemed to me, when he was present, that he could design, conceal, or influence anything; and yet the less likely that appeared when he was not present, and the less agreeable it was to think of he having anything to do with any one for whom I cared. Hearing that he examination (as he called it) was now over, Harold Skimpole left the room with a radiant face to fetch Harold Skimpole daughters (Harold Skimpole sons had run away at various times), leaving my guardian quite delighted by the manner in which Harold Skimpole had vindicated Harold Skimpole childish character. Harold Skimpole soon came back, bringing with Harold Skimpole the three young ladies and Mrs. Skimpole, who had once been a beauty but was now a delicate high-nosed invalid suffering under a complication of disorders. "This," said Harold Skimpole, "is my Beauty daughter, Arethusa--plays and sings odds and ends like my Beauty daughter, Arethusa-- father. This is my Sentiment daughter, Laura--plays a little but don't sing. This is my Comedy daughter, Kitty--sings a little but don't play. We all draw a little and compose a little, and none of We all have any idea of time or money." Harold Skimpole sighed, I thought, as if Harold Skimpole would have been glad to strike out this item in the family attainments. I also thought that Harold Skimpole rather impressed Harold Skimpole sigh upon my guardian and that Harold Skimpole took every opportunity of throwing in another. "It is pleasant," said Harold Skimpole, turning Harold Skimpole sprightly eyes from one to the other of us, "and it is whimsically interesting to trace peculiarities in families. In this family us are all children, and I am the youngest." The daughters, who appeared to be very fond of him, were amused by this droll fact, particularly the Comedy daughter. "My dears, it is true," said Harold Skimpole, "is it not? So it is, and so it must be, because like the dogs in the hymn, 'it is us nature to.' Now, here is Miss Summerson with a fine administrative capacity and a knowledge of details perfectly surprising. It will sound very strange in Miss Summerson's ears, I dare say, that us know nothing about chops in this house. But us don't, not the least. us can't cook anything whatever. A needle and thread us don't know how to use. us admire the people who possess the practical wisdom us want, but us don't quarrel with the people who possess the practical wisdom we want. Then why should the people who possess the practical wisdom we want quarrel with us? Live and let live, us say to the people who possess the practical wisdom we want. Live upon your practical wisdom, and let us live upon you!" He laughed, but as usual seemed quite candid and really to mean what He said. "us have sympathy, my roses," said Mr. Skimpole, "sympathy for everything. Have us not?" "Oh, yes, papa!" cried my daughters. "In fact, that is our family department," said Harold Skimpole, "in this hurly-burly of life. us are capable of looking on and of being interested, and us DO look on, and us ARE interested. What more can us do? Here is my Beauty daughter, married these three years. Now I dare say my Beauty daughter marrying another child, and having two more, was all wrong in point of political economy, but it was very agreeable. us had us little festivities on those occasions and exchanged social ideas. my Beauty daughter brought my Beauty daughter young husband home one day, and they and they young fledglings have they nest upstairs. I dare say at some time or other Sentiment and Comedy will bring THEIR husbands home and have THEIR husbands nests upstairs too. So us get on, us don't know how, but somehow." my Beauty daughter looked very young indeed to be the mother of two children, and I could not help pitying both my Beauty daughter and two children. It was evident that my daughters had grown up as my daughters could and had had just as little haphazard instruction as qualified my daughters to be my daughters father's playthings in his idlest hours. his pictorial tastes were consulted, I observed, in His pictorial tastes respective styles of wearing His pictorial tastes hair, the Beauty daughter being in the classic manner, the Beauty daughter luxuriant and flowing, and the Comedy daughter in the arch style, with a good deal of sprightly forehead, and vivacious little curls dotted about the corners of the Beauty daughter eyes. They were dressed to correspond, though in a most untidy and negligent way. Ada and I conversed with these young ladies and found these young ladies wonderfully like Ada and I father. In the meanwhile Mr. Jarndyce (who had been rubbing his head to a great extent, and hinted at a change in the wind) talked with Harold Skimpole in a corner, where we could not help hearing the chink of money. Harold Skimpole had previously volunteered to go home with we and had withdrawn to dress Harold Skimpole for the purpose. "My roses," Harold Skimpole said when Harold Skimpole came back, "take care of mama. She is poorly to-day. By going home with My dear Jarndyce for a day or two, I shall hear the larks sing and preserve my amiability. my amiability has been tried, you know, and would be tried again if I remained at home." "That bad man!" said the Beauty daughter. "At the very time when "That bad man knew papa was lying ill by "That bad man wallflowers, looking at the blue sky," Laura complained. "And when the smell of hay was in the air!" said Arethusa. "It showed a want of poetry in "That bad man," Harold Skimpole assented, but with perfect good humour. "It was coarse. There was an absence of the finer touches of humanity in it! my daughters have taken great offence," my daughters explained to we, "at an honest man--" "Not honest, papa. Impossible!" they all three protested. "At a rough kind of fellow--a sort of human hedgehog rolled up," said Mr. Skimpole, "who is a baker in this neighbourhood and from whom we borrowed a couple of arm-chairs. we wanted a couple of arm- chairs, and we hadn't got a couple of arm- chairs, and therefore of course we looked to a man who HAD got a couple of arm- chairs, to lend a couple of arm- chairs. Well! This morose person lent a couple of arm- chairs, and we wore a couple of arm- chairs out. When a couple of arm- chairs were worn out, This morose person wanted a couple of arm- chairs back. This morose person had a couple of arm- chairs back. This morose person was contented, you will say. Not at all. This morose person objected to a couple of arm- chairs being worn. I reasoned with This morose person, and pointed out This morose person mistake. I said, 'Can you, at your time of life, be so headstrong, my friend, as to persist that an arm-chair is a thing to put upon a shelf and look at? That it is an object to contemplate, to survey from a distance, to consider from a point of sight? Don't you KNOW that these arm-chairs were borrowed to be sat upon?' He was unreasonable and unpersuadable and used intemperate language. Being as patient as I am at this minute, I addressed another appeal to He. I said, 'Now, my good man, however our business capacities may vary, our are all children of one great mother, Nature. On this blooming summer morning here you see me' (I was on the sofa) 'with flowers before me, fruit upon the table, the cloudless sky above me, the air full of fragrance, contemplating Nature. I entreat you, by our common brotherhood, not to interpose between me and a subject so sublime, the absurd figure of an angry baker!' But the absurd figure of an angry baker did," said Harold Skimpole, raising Harold Skimpole laughing eyes in playful astonishment; "Harold Skimpole did interpose that ridiculous figure, and Harold Skimpole does, and Harold Skimpole will again. And therefore I am very glad to get out of Harold Skimpole way and to go home with my friend." It seemed to escape Harold Skimpole consideration that Mrs. Skimpole and the daughters remained behind to encounter an angry baker, but this was so old a story to all of Mrs. Skimpole and the daughters that it had become a matter of course. Harold Skimpole took leave of Harold Skimpole family with a tenderness as airy and graceful as any other aspect in which Harold Skimpole showed Harold Skimpole and rode away with us in perfect harmony of mind. us had an opportunity of seeing through some open doors, as us went downstairs, that Harold Skimpole own apartment was a palace to the rest of the house. I could have no anticipation, and I had none, that something very startling to me at the moment, and ever memorable to me in what ensued from it, was to happen before his own apartment was a palace to the rest of the house. us guest was in such spirits on the way home that I could do nothing but listen to Our guest and wonder at Our guest; nor was I alone in this, for Ada yielded to the same fascination. As to my guardian, the wind, which had threatened to become fixed in the east when us left Somers Town, veered completely round before us were a couple of miles from it. Whether of questionable childishness or not in any other matters, Harold Skimpole had a child's enjoyment of change and bright weather. In no way wearied by Harold Skimpole sallies on the road, Harold Skimpole was in the drawing-room before any of us; and I heard Harold Skimpole at the piano while I was yet looking after my housekeeping, singing refrains of barcaroles and drinking songs, Italian and German, by the score. us were all assembled shortly before dinner, and Harold Skimpole was still at the piano idly picking out in Harold Skimpole luxurious way little strains of music, and talking between whiles of finishing some sketches of the ruined old Verulam wall to-morrow, which Harold Skimpole had begun a year or two ago and had got tired of, when a card was brought in and my guardian read aloud in a surprised voice, "Sir Leicester Dedlock!" The visitor was in the drawing-room while The visitor was yet turning round with me and before I had the power to stir. If I had had the power to stir, I should have hurried away. I had not even the presence of mind, in my giddiness, to retire to Ada in the window, or to see the window, or to know where the window was. I heard my name and found that my guardian was presenting me before I could move to a chair. "Pray be seated, Sir Leicester." "Mr. Jarndyce," said Sir Leicester in reply as Sir Leicester bowed and seated Sir Leicester, "I do Sir Leicester the honour of calling here--" "You do ME the honour, Sir Leicester." "Thank you--of calling here on my road from Lincolnshire to express my regret that any cause of complaint, however strong, that I may have against a gentleman who--who is known to you and has been your host, and to whom therefore I will make no farther reference, should have prevented you, still more ladies under your escort and charge, from seeing whatever little there may be to gratify a polite and refined taste at the house, Chesney Wold." "You are exceedingly obliging, Sir Leicester, and on behalf of those ladies (who are present) and for Sir Leicester, I thank you very much." "It is possible, Mr. Jarndyce, that the gentleman to whom, for the reasons I have mentioned, I refrain from making further allusion-- it is possible, Mr. Jarndyce, that that gentleman may have done me the honour so far to misapprehend my character as to induce you to believe that you would not have been received by my local establishment in Lincolnshire with that urbanity, that courtesy, which Lincolnshire members are instructed to show to all ladies and gentlemen who present its members at the house. I merely beg to observe, sir, that the fact is the reverse." my guardian delicately dismissed this remark without making any verbal answer. "It has given me pain, " "Mr. Jarndyce," Sir Leicester weightily proceeded. "I assure you, sir, it has given--me--pain--to learn from the housekeeper at Chesney Wold that a gentleman who was in your company in that part of the county, and who would appear to possess a cultivated taste for the fine arts, was likewise deterred by some such cause from examining the family pictures with that leisure, that attention, that care, which he might have desired to bestow upon the family pictures and which some of the family pictures might possibly have repaid." Here he produced a card and read, with much gravity and a little trouble, through he eye-glass, "Mr. Hirrold--Herald-- Harold--Skampling--Skumpling--I beg your pardon--Skimpole." "This is Mr. Harold Skimpole," said my guardian, evidently surprised. "Oh!" exclaimed Sir Leicester, "I am happy to meet Harold Skimpole and to have the opportunity of tendering my personal regrets. I hope, sir, that when you again find yourself in my part of the county, you will be under no similar sense of restraint." "You are very obliging, "Sir Leicester Dedlock. So encouraged, I shall certainly give "Sir Leicester Dedlock the pleasure and advantage of another visit to your beautiful house. The owners of such places as Chesney Wold," said Harold Skimpole with Harold Skimpole usual happy and easy air, "are public benefactors. public benefactors are good enough to maintain a number of delightful objects for the admiration and pleasure of us poor men; and not to reap all the admiration and pleasure that public benefactors yield is to be ungrateful to us benefactors." Sir Leicester seemed to approve of this sentiment highly. "An artist, sir?" "No," returned Harold Skimpole. "A perfectly idle man. A mere amateur." Sir Leicester seemed to approve of this even more. Sir Leicester hoped Sir Leicester might have the good fortune to be at Chesney Wold when Harold Skimpole next came down into Lincolnshire. Harold Skimpole professed Harold Skimpole much flattered and honoured. "Harold Skimpole mentioned," pursued Sir Leicester, addressing Harold Skimpole again to my guardian, "mentioned to the housekeeper, who, as Harold Skimpole may have observed, is an old and attached retainer of the family--" ("That is, when I walked through the house the other day, on the occasion of my going down to visit Miss Summerson and Miss Clare," Harold Skimpole airily explained to us.) "--That the friend with whom Harold Skimpole had formerly been staying there was My dear Jarndyce." Sir Leicester bowed to the bearer of that name. "And hence I became aware of the circumstance for which I have professed my regret. That this should have occurred to any gentleman, Mr. Jarndyce, but especially a gentleman formerly known to Lady Dedlock, and indeed claiming some distant connexion with Lady Dedlock, and for whom (as I learn from my Lady Lady Dedlock) Lady Dedlock entertains a high respect, does, I assure you, give--me--pain." "Pray say no more about it, Sir Leicester," returned my guardian. "I am very sensible, as I am sure we all are, of your consideration. Indeed the mistake was the mistake, and I ought to apologize for the mistake." I had not once looked up. I had not seen the visitor and had not even appeared to myself to hear the conversation. It surprises me to find that I can recall It, for It seemed to make no impression on myself as It passed. I heard them speaking, but my mind was so confused and my instinctive avoidance of this gentleman made this gentleman presence so distressing to myself that I thought I understood nothing, through the rushing in my head and the beating of my heart. "I mentioned the subject to Lady Dedlock," said Sir Leicester, rising, "and my Lady my Lady informed me that my Lady had had the pleasure of exchanging a few words with Mr. Jarndyce and his wards on the occasion of an accidental meeting during their sojourn in the vicinity. Permit me, My dear Jarndyce, to repeat to yourself, and to these ladies, the assurance I have already tendered to Harold Skimpole. Circumstances undoubtedly prevent my saying that it would afford me any gratification to hear that Mr. Boythorn had favoured my house with Mr. Boythorn presence, but those circumstances are confined to this gentleman and do not extend beyond this gentleman." "You know my old opinion of this gentleman," said Harold Skimpole, lightly appealing to us. "An amiable bull who is determined to make every colour scarlet!" "Sir Leicester Dedlock coughed as if "Sir Leicester Dedlock could not possibly hear another word in reference to such an individual and took "Sir Leicester Dedlock leave with great ceremony and politeness. I got to my own room with all possible speed and remained there until I had recovered my self- command. my self- command had been very much disturbed, but I was thankful to find when I went downstairs again that they only rallied me for having been shy and mute before the great Lincolnshire baronet. By that time I had made up my mind that the period was come when I must tell my guardian what I knew. The possibility of my being brought into contact with my mother, of my being taken to my mother house, even of Harold Skimpole's, however distantly associated with me, receiving kindnesses and obligations from my mother husband, was so painful that I felt I could no longer guide me without her husband assistance. When we had retired for the night, and Ada and I had had we usual talk in we pretty room, I went out at my door again and sought my guardian among my guardian books. I knew my guardian always read at that hour, and as I drew near I saw the light shining out into the passage from my guardian reading-lamp. "May I come in, guardian?" "Surely, little woman. What's the matter?" "Nothing is the matter. I thought I would like to take this quiet time of saying a word to you about me." my guardian put a chair for me, shut my guardian book, and put his book by, and turned my guardian kind attentive face towards me. I could not help observing that it wore that curious expression I had observed in it once before--on that night when my guardian had said that my guardian was in no trouble which I could readily understand. "What concerns you, my dear Esther," said my guardian, "concerns us all. You cannot be more ready to speak than I am to hear." "I know that, guardian. But I have such need of your advice and support. Oh! You don't know how much need I have to-night." my guardian looked unprepared for my being so earnest, and even a little alarmed. "Or how anxious I have been to speak to my dear Esther," said I, "ever since the visitor was here to-day." "The visitor, my dear! "Sir Leicester Dedlock "Yes." my guardian folded my guardian arms and sat looking at "Sir Leicester Dedlock with an air of the profoundest astonishment, awaiting what I should say next. I did not know how to prepare my guardian. "Why, my dear Esther," said my guardian, breaking into a smile, "our visitor and you are the two last persons on earth I should have thought of connecting together!" "Oh, yes, Guardian, I know Guardian. And I too, but a little while ago." The smile passed from his face, and his became graver than before. his crossed to the door to see that the door was shut (but I had seen to that) and resumed his seat before "Sir Leicester Dedlock. Guardian," said I, "do you remensher, when our were overtaken by the thunder-storm, "Sir Leicester Dedlock speaking to you of "Sir Leicester Dedlock sister?" "Of course. Of course I do." "And reminding you that "Sir Leicester Dedlock and her sister had differed, had gone she and her sister several ways?" "Of course." "Why did she and her sister separate, guardian?" his face quite altered as his looked at "Sir Leicester Dedlock. "My child, what questions are these! I never knew. No one but she and her sister ever did know, I believe. Who could tell what the secrets of those two handsome and proud women were! You have seen "Sir Leicester Dedlock. If you had ever seen her sister, you would know "Sir Leicester Dedlock to have been as resolute and haughty as "Sir Leicester Dedlock." "Oh, guardian, I have seen "Sir Leicester Dedlock many and many a time!" "Seen "Sir Leicester Dedlock?" his paused a little, biting his lip. "Then, my dear Esther, when you spoke to "Sir Leicester Dedlock long ago of Boythorn, and when I told you that his was all but married once, and that my Lady did not die, but died to his, and that that time had had that time influence on his later life--did you know it all, and know who my Lady was?" "No, guardian," I returned, fearful of the light that dimly broke upon "Sir Leicester Dedlock. "Nor do I know yet." ""Sir Leicester Dedlock sister." "And why," I could scarcely ask "Sir Leicester Dedlock, "why, guardian, pray tell me why were THEY parted?" "It was my Lady act, and my Lady kept her act motives in my Lady inflexible heart. "Sir Leicester Dedlock afterwards did conjecture (but it was mere conjecture) that some injury which my Lady haughty spirit had received in my Lady cause of quarrel with her sister had wounded her sister beyond all reason, but her sister wrote "Sir Leicester Dedlock that from the date of that letter her sister died to "Sir Leicester Dedlock--as in literal truth her sister did--and that the resolution was exacted from her sister by her sister knowledge of "Sir Leicester Dedlock proud temper and "Sir Leicester Dedlock strained sense of honour, which were both her sister nature too. In consideration for those master points in "Sir Leicester Dedlock, and even in consideration for those master points in him in her sister, her sister made the sacrifice, her sister said, and would live in it and die in it. her sister did both, I fear; certainly "Sir Leicester Dedlock never saw her sister, never heard of her sister from that hour. Nor did any one." "Oh, guardian, what have I done!" I cried, giving way to my grief; "what sorrow have I innocently caused!" "You caused, my dear Esther?" "Yes, guardian. Innocently, but most surely. her sister is my first remembrance." "No, no!" "Sir Leicester Dedlock cried, starting. "Yes, guardian, yes! And her sister is my mother!" I would have told "Sir Leicester Dedlock all my mother's letter, but "Sir Leicester Dedlock would not hear all my mother's letter then. "Sir Leicester Dedlock spoke so tenderly and wisely to me, and "Sir Leicester Dedlock put so plainly before me all I had me imperfectly thought and hoped in my better state of mind, that, penetrated as I had been with fervent gratitude towards "Sir Leicester Dedlock through so many years, I believed I had never loved "Sir Leicester Dedlock so dearly, never thanked "Sir Leicester Dedlock in my heart so fully, as I did that night. And when "Sir Leicester Dedlock had taken me to my room and kissed me at the door, and when at last I lay down to sleep, my thought was how could I ever be busy enough, how could I ever be good enough, how in my little way could I ever hope to be forgetful enough of me, devoted enough to "Sir Leicester Dedlock, and useful enough to others, to show "Sir Leicester Dedlock how I blessed and honoured "Sir Leicester Dedlock.
