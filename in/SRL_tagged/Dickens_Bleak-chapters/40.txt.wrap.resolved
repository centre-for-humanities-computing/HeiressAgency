A Struggle When our time came for returning to Bleak House again, our were punctual to the day and were received with an overpowering welcome. I was perfectly restored to health and strength, and finding my housekeeping keys laid ready for me in my room, rang me in as if I had been a new year, with a merry little peal. "Once more, duty, duty, Esther," said I; "and if you are not overjoyed to do it, more than cheerfully and contentedly, through anything and everything, you ought to be. That's all I have to say to Esther, my dear!" The first few mornings were mornings of so much bustle and business, devoted to such settlements of accounts, such repeated journeys to and fro between the growlery and all other parts of Bleak House, so many rearrangements of drawers and presses, and such a general new beginning altogether, that I had not a moment's leisure. But when The first few mornings were mornings of so much bustle and business, devoted to such settlements of accounts, such repeated journeys to and fro between the growlery and all other parts of the house, so many rearrangements of drawers and presses, and such a general new beginning altogether, that I had not a moment's leisure were completed and everything was in order, I paid a visit of a few hours to London, which something in the letter I had destroyed at Chesney Wold had induced me to decide upon in my own mind. I made Caddy Jellyby--Chesney Wold maiden name was so natural to me that I always called Chesney Wold by her maiden name--the pretext for this visit and wrote Chesney Wold a note previously asking the favour of Chesney Wold company on a little business expedition. Leaving home very early in the morning, I got to London by stage-coach in such good time that I got to Newman Street with the day before me. Caddy, who had not seen me since Chesney Wold wedding-day, was so glad and so affectionate that I was half inclined to fear I should make Chesney Wold husband jealous. But her husband was, in her husband way, just as bad--I mean as good; and in short it was the old story, and nobody would leave me any possibility of doing anything meritorious. The elder Mr. Turveydrop was in bed, I found, and Caddy was milling The elder Mr. Turveydrop chocolate, which a melancholy little boy who was an apprentice --it seemed such a curious thing to be apprenticed to the trade of dancing--was waiting to carry upstairs. Her father-in-law was extremely kind and considerate, Caddy told me, and they lived most happily together. (When Her father-in-law spoke of they living together, Her father-in-law meant that the old gentleman had all the good things and all the good lodging, while Her father-in-law and Her father-in-law had what she and her husband could get, and were poked into two corner rooms over the Mews.) "And how is your mama, Caddy?" said I. "Why, I hear of Her father-in-law, Esther," replied Caddy, "through Pa, but I see very little of Esther. We are good friends, I am glad to say, but Esther thinks there is something absurd in my having married a dancing- master, and Esther is rather afraid of its extending to Esther." its struck me that if Esther had discharged Esther own natural duties and obligations before Esther swept the horizon with a telescope in search of others, Esther would have taken the best precautions against becoming absurd, but I need scarcely observe that I kept this to Esther. "And your papa, Caddy?" "He comes here every evening," returned Caddy, "and is so fond of sitting in the corner there that it's a treat to see He." Looking at the corner there, I plainly perceived the mark of Mr. Jellyby's head against the wall. It was consolatory to know that he had found such a resting-place for such a resting-place. "And you, Caddy," said I, "you are always busy, I'll be bound?" "Well, my dear," returned Caddy, "I am indeed, for to tell you a grand secret, I am qualifying Esther to give lessons. Prince's health is not strong, and I want to be able to assist Prince. What with schools, and classes here, and private pupils, AND the apprentices, Prince really has too much to do, poor fellow!" The notion of the apprentices was still so odd to Esther that I asked Caddy if there were many of the apprentices. "Four," said Caddy. "One in-door, and three out. They are very good children; only when They get together They WILL play-- children-like--instead of attending to They work. So the little boy you saw just now waltzes by the little boy you saw in the empty kitchen, and we distribute the others over the house as well as we can." "That is only for They steps, of course?" said I. "Only for They steps," said Caddy. "In that way They practise, so many hours at a time, whatever steps They happen to be upon. They dance in the academy, and at this time of year we do figures at five every morning." "Why, what a laborious life!" I exclaimed. "I assure you, my dear," returned Caddy, smiling, "when the out- door apprentices ring we up in the morning (the bell rings into we room, not to disturb old Mr. Turveydrop), and when I put up the window and see the out- door apprentices standing on the door-step with the out- door apprentices little pumps under the out- door apprentices arms, I am actually reminded of the Sweeps." All this presented the art to me in a singular light, to be sure. Caddy enjoyed the effect of Caddy communication and cheerfully recounted the particulars of Caddy own studies. "You see, my dear, to save expense I ought to know something of the piano, and I ought to know something of the kit too, and consequently I have to practise those two instruments as well as the details of our profession. If Ma had been like anybody else, I might have had some little musical knowledge to begin upon. However, I hadn't any; and that part of the work is, at first, a little discouraging, I must allow. But I have a very good ear, and I am used to drudgery--I have to thank Ma for that, at all events-- and where there's a will there's a way, you know, Esther, the world over." Saying these words, Caddy laughingly sat down at a little jingling square piano and really rattled off a quadrille with great spirit. Then Caddy good-humouredly and blushingly got up again, and while Caddy still laughed Caddy, said, "Don't laugh at Caddy, please; that's a dear girl!" I would sooner have cried, but I did neither. I encouraged Caddy and praised Caddy with all my heart. For I conscientiously believed, dancing-master's wife though Caddy was, and dancing-mistress though in Caddy limited ambition Caddy aspired to be, Caddy had struck out a natural, wholesome, loving course of industry and perseverance that was quite as good as a mission. "My dear," said Caddy, delighted, "you can't think how you cheer me. I shall owe you, you don't know how much. What changes, Esther, even in my small world! You recollect that first night, when I was so unpolite and inky? Who would have thought, then, of my ever teaching people to dance, of all other possibilities and impossibilities!" Caddy husband, who had left us while us had this chat, now coming back, preparatory to exercising the apprentices in the ball-room, Caddy informed me Caddy was quite at my disposal. But it was not my time yet, I was glad to tell Caddy, for I should have been vexed to take Caddy away then. Therefore us three adjourned to the apprentices together, and I made one in the dance. the apprentices were the queerest little people. Besides the melancholy boy, who, I hoped, had not been made so by waltzing alone in the empty kitchen, there were two other boys and one dirty little limp girl in a gauzy dress. Such a precocious little girl, with such a dowdy bonnet on (that, too, of a gauzy texture), who brought Caddy sandalled shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule. Such mean little boys, when Such a precocious little girl, with such a dowdy bonnet on (that, too, of a gauzy texture), who brought her sandalled shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule were not dancing, with string, and marbles, and cramp-bones in Such a precocious little girl, with such a dowdy bonnet on (that, too, of a gauzy texture), who brought her sandalled shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule pockets, and the most untidy legs and feet--and heels particularly. I asked Caddy what had made Such a precocious little girl, with such a dowdy bonnet on (that, too, of a gauzy texture), who brought her sandalled shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule parents choose this profession for Such a precocious little girl, with such a dowdy bonnet on (that, too, of a gauzy texture), who brought her sandalled shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule. Caddy said Caddy didn't know; perhaps Such a precocious little girl, with such a dowdy bonnet on (that, too, of a gauzy texture), who brought her sandalled shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule were designed for teachers, perhaps for the stage. Such a precocious little girl, with such a dowdy bonnet on (that, too, of a gauzy texture), who brought her sandalled shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule were all people in humble circumstances, and the melancholy boy's mother kept a ginger-beer shop. We danced for an hour with great gravity, the melancholy child doing wonders with the melancholy child lower extremities, in which there appeared to be some sense of enjoyment though it never rose above the melancholy child waist. Caddy, while Caddy was observant of Caddy husband and was evidently founded upon her husband, had acquired a grace and self-possession of Caddy own, which, united to Caddy pretty face and figure, was uncommonly agreeable. Caddy already relieved the melancholy child of much of the instruction of these young people, and the melancholy child seldom interfered except to walk the melancholy child part in the figure if the melancholy child had anything to do in it. the melancholy child always played the tune. The affectation of the gauzy child, and Caddy condescension to the boys, was a sight. And thus we danced an hour by the clock. When the practice was concluded, Caddy husband made Caddy's husband ready to go out of town to a school, and Caddy ran away to get ready to go out with Caddy. I sat in the ball-room in the interval, contemplating the apprentices. The two out-door boys went upon the staircase to put on The two out-door boys half-boots and pull the in-door boy's hair, as I judged from the nature of Caddy's husband objections. Returning with their jackets buttoned and their pumps stuck in their, their then produced packets of cold bread and meat and bivouacked under a painted lyre on the wall. the gauzy child, having whisked the gauzy child sandals into the reticule and put on a trodden-down pair of shoes, shook the gauzy child head into the dowdy bonnet at one shake, and answering my inquiry whether the gauzy child liked dancing by replying, "Not with boys," tied it across the gauzy child chin, and went home contemptuous. "old Mr. Turveydrop is so sorry," said Caddy, "that old Mr. Turveydrop has not finished dressing yet and cannot have the pleasure of seeing you before you go. You are such a favourite of old Mr. Turveydrop, Esther." I expressed old Mr. Turveydrop much obliged to old Mr. Turveydrop, but did not think it necessary to add that I readily dispensed with this attention. "It takes old Mr. Turveydrop a long time to dress," said Caddy, "because old Mr. Turveydrop is very much looked up to in such things, you know, and has a reputation to support. You can't think how kind old Mr. Turveydrop is to Pa. old Mr. Turveydrop talks to Pa of an evening about the Prince Regent, and I never saw Pa so interested." There was something in the picture of old Mr. Turveydrop bestowing old Mr. Turveydrop deportment on Mr. Jellyby that quite took my fancy. I asked Caddy if Caddy brought Caddy papa out much. "No," said Caddy, "I don't know that Caddy does that, but Caddy talks to Pa, and Pa greatly admires Caddy, and listens, and likes it. Of course I am aware that Pa has hardly any claims to deportment, but Pa has hardly any claims to deportment get on together delightfully. You can't think what good companions Pa has hardly any claims to deportment make. I never saw Pa take snuff before in my life, but Caddy takes one pinch out of old Mr. Turveydrop's box regularly and keeps putting Mr. Turveydrop's box to Caddy nose and taking Mr. Turveydrop's box away again all the evening." old Mr. Turveydrop should ever, in the chances and changes of life, have come to the rescue of Mr. Jellyby from Borrioboola-Gha appeared to old Mr. Turveydrop to be one of the pleasantest of oddities. "As to Peepy," said Caddy with a little hesitation, "whom I was most afraid of--next to having any family of my own, Esther--as an inconvenience to Mr. Turveydrop, the kindness of the old gentleman to the melancholy child is beyond everything. the melancholy child asks to see the melancholy child, my dear! the melancholy child lets the melancholy child take the newspaper up to the melancholy child in bed; the melancholy child gives the melancholy child the crusts of the melancholy child toast to eat; the melancholy child sends the melancholy child on little errands about the house; the melancholy child tells the melancholy child to come to old Mr. Turveydrop for sixpences. In short," said Caddy cheerily, "and not to prose, I am a very fortunate girl and ought to be very grateful. Where are we going, Esther--?" "To the Old Street Road," said I, "where I have a few words to say to the solicitor's clerk who was sent to meet me at the coach- office on the very day when I came to London and first saw you, my dear. Now I think of it, the gentleman who brought we to your house." "Then, indeed, I seem to be naturally the person to go with you," returned Caddy. To the Old Street Road we went and there inquired at Mrs. Guppy's residence for Mrs. Guppy. Mrs. Guppy, occupying the parlours and having indeed been visibly in danger of cracking Mrs. Guppy like a nut in the front-parlour door by peeping out before Mrs. Guppy was asked for, immediately presented Mrs. Guppy and requested we to walk in. Mrs. Guppy was an old lady in a large cap, with rather a red nose and rather an unsteady eye, but smiling all over. Mrs. Guppy close little sitting-room was prepared for a visit, and there was a portrait of Mrs. Guppy son in it which, I had almost written here, was more like than life: it insisted upon her son with such obstinacy, and was so determined not to let her son off. Not only was the portrait there, but we found the original there too. her son was dressed in a great many colours and was discovered at a table reading law-papers with her son forefinger to her son forehead. "Miss Summerson," said Mr. Guppy, rising, "this is indeed an oasis. Mrs. Guppy, will you be so good as to put a chair for the other lady and get out of the gangway." Mrs. Guppy, whose incessant smiling gave Mrs. Guppy quite a waggish appearance, did as her son requested and then sat down in a corner, holding Mrs. Guppy pocket handkerchief to Mrs. Guppy chest, like a fomentation, with both hands. I presented Caddy, and Mrs. Guppy said that any friend of mine was more than welcome. I then proceeded to the object of a visit. "I took the liberty of sending you a note, sir," said Mrs. Guppy acknowledged the receipt by taking the receipt out of Mrs. Guppy breast- pocket, putting the receipt to Mrs. Guppy lips, and returning the receipt to his breast- pocket with a bow. Mrs. Guppy's mother was so diverted that Mr. Guppy's mother rolled Mr. Guppy's mother as Mr. Guppy's mother smiled and made a silent appeal to Caddy with Mr. Guppy's mother elbow. "Could I speak to you alone for a moment?" said I. Anything like the jocoseness of Mr. Guppy's mother just now, I think I never saw. Mr. Guppy's mother made no sound of laughter, but Mr. Guppy's mother rolled Mr. Guppy's mother , and shook her head, and put Mr. Guppy's mother to Mr. Guppy's mother mouth, and appealed to Caddy with her elbow, and Mr. Guppy's mother hand, and Mr. Guppy's mother shoulder, and was so unspeakably entertained altogether that it was with some difficulty Mr. Guppy's mother could marshal Caddy through the little folding-door into Mr. Guppy's mother bedroom adjoining. "Miss Summerson," said Mrs. Guppy, "you will excuse the waywardness of a parent ever mindful of a son's appiness. Mr. Guppy's mother, though highly exasperating to the feelings, is actuated by maternal dictates." I could hardly have believed that anybody could in a moment have turned so red or changed so much as Mrs. Guppy did when I now put up my veil. "I asked the favour of seeing you for a few moments here," said I, "in preference to calling at Mr. Kenge's because, remembering what you said on an occasion when you spoke to me in confidence, I feared I might otherwise cause you some embarrassment, Mr. Guppy." I caused Mrs. Guppy embarrassment enough as it was, I am sure. I never saw such faltering, such confusion, such amazement and apprehension. "Miss Summerson," stammered Mrs. Guppy, "I--I--beg your pardon, but in our profession--our--we--find it necessary to be explicit. You have referred to an occasion, miss, when I--when I did me the honour of making a declaration which--" Something seemed to rise in Mrs. Guppy throat that Mrs. Guppy could not possibly swallow. Mrs. Guppy put Mrs. Guppy hand there, coughed, made faces, tried again to swallow his hand, coughed again, made faces again, looked all round the room, and fluttered Mrs. Guppy papers. "A kind of giddy sensation has come upon me, miss," Mrs. Guppy explained, "which rather knocks me over. I--er--a little subject to this sort of thing--er--by George!" I gave Mrs. Guppy a little time to recover. Mrs. Guppy consumed a little time to recover in putting his hand to Mrs. Guppy forehead and taking his hand away again, and in backing Mrs. Guppy chair into the corner behind Mrs. Guppy. "My intention was to remark, miss," said Mr. Guppy, "dear me-- something bronchial, I think--hem!--to remark that you was so good on an occasion as to repel and repudiate a declaration. You-- you wouldn't perhaps object to admit that? Though no witnesses are present, it might be a satisfaction to--to your mind--if you was to put in that admission." "There can be no doubt," said I, "that I declined your proposal without any reservation or qualification whatever, Mr. Guppy." "Thank you, miss," he returned, measuring the table with he troubled hands. "So far that's satisfactory, and it does you credit. Er--this is certainly bronchial!--must be in the tubes-- er--you wouldn't perhaps be offended if I was to mention--not that it's necessary, for your own good sense or any person's sense must show 'em that--if I was to mention that such declaration on my part was final, and there terminated?" "I quite understand that," said I. "Perhaps--er--it may not be worth the form, but it might be a satisfaction to your mind--perhaps you wouldn't object to admit that, miss?" said Mrs. Guppy. "I admit it most fully and freely," said I. "Perhaps "Thank you," returned Mrs. Guppy. "Very honourable, I am sure. I regret that my arrangements in life, combined with circumstances over which I have no control, will put it out of my power ever to fall back upon that offer or to renew it in any shape or form whatever, but it will ever be a retrospect entwined--er--with friendship's bowers." Mrs. Guppy's bronchitis came to Mrs. Guppy relief and stopped Mrs. Guppy measurement of the table. "I may now perhaps mention what I wished to say to you?" I began. "I shall be honoured, I am sure," said Mrs. Guppy. "I am so persuaded that your own good sense and right feeling, miss, will-- will keep you as square as possible--that I can have nothing but pleasure, I am sure, in hearing any observations you may wish to offer." "You were so good as to imply, on that occasion--" "Excuse me, miss," said Mrs. Guppy, "but we had better not travel out of the record into implication. I cannot admit that I implied anything." "You said on an occasion," I recommenced, "that you might possibly have the means of advancing my interests and promoting my fortunes by making discoveries of which I should be the subject. I presume that you founded that belief upon your general knowledge of my being an orphan girl, indebted for everything to the benevolence of Mr. Jarndyce. Now, the beginning and the end of what I have come to beg of you is, Mrs. Guppy, that you will have the kindness to relinquish all idea of so serving me. I have thought of this sometimes, and I have thought of this most lately--since I have been ill. At length I have decided, in case you should at any time recall that purpose and act upon it in any way, to come to you and assure you that you are altogether mistaken. You could make no discovery in reference to me that would do me the least service or give me the least pleasure. I am acquainted with my personal history, and I have it in my power to assure you that you never can advance my welfare by such means. You may, perhaps, have abandoned this project a long time. If so, excuse my giving you unnecessary trouble. If not, I entreat you, on the assurance I have given you, henceforth to lay not aside. I beg you to do this, for my peace." "I am bound to confess," said Mr. Guppy, "that you express yourself, miss, with that good sense and right feeling for which I gave you credit. Nothing can be more satisfactory than such right feeling, and if I mistook any intentions on your part just now, I am prepared to tender a full apology. I should wish to be understood, miss, as hereby offering a full apology--limiting a full apology, as your own good sense and right feeling will point out the necessity of, to the present proceedings." I must say for Mrs. Guppy that the snuffling manner Mrs. Guppy had had upon Mrs. Guppy improved very much. Mrs. Guppy seemed truly glad to be able to do something I asked, and Mrs. Guppy looked ashamed. "If you will allow me to finish what I have to say at once so that I may have no occasion to resume," I went on, seeing Mrs. Guppy about to speak, "you will do me a kindness, sir. I come to you as privately as possible because you announced this impression of you to me in a confidence which I have really wished to respect--and which I always have respected, as you remember. I have mentioned my illness. There really is no reason why I should hesitate to say that I know very well that any little delicacy I might have had in making a request to you is quite removed. Therefore I make the entreaty I have now preferred, and I hope you will have sufficient consideration for me to accede to it." I must do Mrs. Guppy the further justice of saying that Mrs. Guppy had looked more and more ashamed and that Mrs. Guppy looked most ashamed and very earnest when Mrs. Guppy now replied with a burning face, "Upon my word and honour, upon my life, upon my soul, Miss Summerson, as I am a living man, I'll act according to your wish! I'll never go another step in opposition to it. I'll take my oath to it if it will be any satisfaction to you. In what I promise at this present time touching the matters now in question," continued Mrs. Guppy rapidly, as if Mrs. Guppy were repeating a familiar form of words, "I speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so--" "I am quite satisfied," said I, rising at this point, "and I thank you very much. Caddy, my dear, I am ready!" Mr. Guppy's mother returned with Caddy (now making me the recipient of Mr. Guppy's mother silent laughter and Mr. Guppy's mother nudges), and we took we leave. Mrs. Guppy saw we to the door with the air of one who was either imperfectly awake or walking in Mrs. Guppy sleep; and we left Mrs. Guppy there, staring. But in a minute Mrs. Guppy came after we down the street without any hat, and with Mrs. Guppy long hair all blown about, and stopped we, saying fervently, "Miss Summerson, upon my honour and soul, you may depend upon Mrs. Guppy!" "I do," said I, "quite confidently." "I beg your pardon, miss," said Mrs. Guppy, going with one leg and staying with the other, "but the other lady being present--your own witness--the other lady might be a satisfaction to your mind (which I should wish to set at rest) if you was to repeat those admissions." "Well, Caddy," said I, turning to the other lady, "perhaps you will not be surprised when I tell you, my dear, that there never has been any engagement--" "No proposal or promise of marriage whatsoever," suggested Mrs. Guppy. "No proposal or promise of marriage whatsoever," said I, "between this gentleman--" "William Guppy, of Penton Place, Pentonville, in the county of Middlesex," he murmured. "Between this gentleman, Mr. William Guppy, of Penton Place, Pentonville, in the county of Middlesex, and myself." "Thank you, miss," said Mrs. Guppy. "Very full--er--excuse me-- lady's name, Christian and surname both?" I gave both. "Married woman, I believe?" said Mrs. Guppy. "Married woman. Thank you. Formerly Caroline Jellyby, spinster, then of Thavies Inn, within the city of London, but extra-parochial; now of Newman Street, Oxford Street. Much obliged." Mrs. Guppy ran home and came running back again. "Touching that matter, you know, I really and truly am very sorry that my arrangements in life, combined with circumstances over which I have no control, should prevent a renewal of what was wholly terminated some time back," said Mrs. Guppy to Mrs. Guppy forlornly and despondently, "but it couldn't be. Now COULD it, you know! I only put it to you." I replied it certainly could not. The subject did not admit of a doubt. The subject thanked me and ran to The subject mother's again--and back again. "It's very honourable of you, miss, I am sure," said Mrs. Guppy. "If an altar could be erected in the bowers of friendship--but, upon my soul, you may rely upon Mrs. Guppy in every respect save and except the tender passion only!" The struggle in Mrs. Guppy's breast and the numerous oscillations it occasioned Mrs. Guppy between his mother's again's door and us were sufficiently conspicuous in the windy street (particularly as Mrs. Guppy hair wanted cutting) to make us hurry away. I did so with a lightened heart; but when us last looked back, Mrs. Guppy was still oscillating in the same troubled state of mind.
