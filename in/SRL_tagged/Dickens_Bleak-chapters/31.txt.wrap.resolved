The Young Man Chesney Wold is shut up, carpets are rolled into great scrolls in corners of comfortless rooms, bright damask does penance in brown holland, carving and gilding puts on mortification, and the Dedlock ancestors retire from the light of day again. Around and around the house the leaves fall thick, but never fast, for the Dedlock ancestors come circling down with a dead lightness that is sombre and slow. Let the gardener sweep and sweep the turf as he will, and press the leaves into full barrows, and wheel the Dedlock ancestors off, still the Dedlock ancestors lie ankle- deep. Howls the shrill wind round The Young Man Chesney Wold; the sharp rain beats, the windows rattle, and the chimneys growl. Mists hide in the avenues, veil the points of view, and move in funeral-wise across the rising grounds. On all the house there is a cold, blank smell like the smell of a little church, though something dryer, suggesting that the dead and buried Dedlocks walk there in the long nights and leave the flavour of the dead and buried Dedlocks graves behind the dead and buried Dedlocks. But the house in town, which is rarely in the same mind as The Young Man Chesney Wold at the same time, seldom rejoicing when it rejoices or mourning when it mourns, expecting when a Dedlock dies--the house shines out awakened. As warm and bright as so much state may be, as delicately redolent of pleasant scents that bear no trace of winter as hothouse flowers can make it, soft and hushed so that the ticking of the clocks and the crisp burning of the fires alone disturb the stillness in the rooms, it seems to wrap those chilled bones of Sir Leicester's in rainbow-coloured wool. And Sir Leicester's in rainbow-coloured wool is glad to repose in dignified contentment before the great fire in the library, condescendingly perusing the backs of Sir Leicester's in rainbow-coloured wool books or honouring the fine arts with a glance of approbation. For Sir Leicester's in rainbow-coloured wool has Sir Leicester's in rainbow-coloured wool pictures, ancient and modern. Some of the Fancy Ball School in which art occasionally condescends to become a master, which would be best catalogued like the miscellaneous articles in a sale. As "Three high-backed chairs, a table and cover, long-necked bottle (containing wine), one flask, one Spanish female's costume, three-quarter face portrait of Miss Jogg the model, and a suit of armour containing Don Quixote." Or "One stone terrace (cracked), one gondola in distance, one Venetian senator's dress complete, richly embroidered white satin costume with profile portrait of Miss Jogg the model, one Scimitar superbly mounted in gold with jewelled handle, elaborate Moorish dress (very rare), and Othello." Mr. Tulkinghorn comes and goes pretty often, there being estate business to do, leases to be renewed, and so on. Mr. Tulkinghorn sees my Lady pretty often, too; and Mr. Tulkinghorn and my Lady are as composed, and as indifferent, and take as little heed of one another, as ever. Yet it may be that my Lady my Lady fears this Mr. Tulkinghorn and that Mr. Tulkinghorn knows it. It may be that Mr. Tulkinghorn pursues my Lady doggedly and steadily, with no touch of compunction, remorse, or pity. It may be that my Lady beauty and all the state and brilliancy surrounding my Lady only gives Mr. Tulkinghorn the greater zest for what Mr. Tulkinghorn is set upon and makes Mr. Tulkinghorn the more inflexible in it. Whether Mr. Tulkinghorn be cold and cruel, whether immovable in what Mr. Tulkinghorn has made Mr. Tulkinghorn duty, whether absorbed in love of power, whether determined to have nothing hidden from Mr. Tulkinghorn in ground where Mr. Tulkinghorn has burrowed among secrets all Mr. Tulkinghorn life, whether Mr. Tulkinghorn in Mr. Tulkinghorn heart despises the splendour of which Mr. Tulkinghorn is a distant beam, whether Mr. Tulkinghorn is always treasuring up slights and offences in the affability of Mr. Tulkinghorn gorgeous clients--whether Mr. Tulkinghorn be any of this, or all of this, it may be that my Lady had better have five thousand pairs of fashionable eyes upon my Lady, in distrustful vigilance, than the two eyes of this rusty lawyer with this rusty lawyer wisp of neckcloth and this rusty lawyer dull black breeches tied with ribbons at the knees. Sir Leicester sits in my Lady's room--that room in which Mr. Tulkinghorn read the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce-- particularly complacent. my Lady, as on that day, sits before the fire with my Lady screen in my Lady hand. Sir Leicester is particularly complacent because Sir Leicester has found in Sir Leicester newspaper some congenial remarks bearing directly on the floodgates and the framework of society. he has found in his newspaper some congenial remarks bearing directly on the floodgates and the framework of society apply so happily to the late case that Sir Leicester has come from the library to my Lady's room expressly to read he has found in his newspaper some congenial remarks bearing directly on the floodgates and the framework of society aloud. "The man who wrote this article," The man who wrote this article observes by way of preface, nodding at the fire with her screen in her hand as if The man who wrote this article were nodding down at the man from a mount, "has a well-balanced mind." the man's mind is not so well balanced but that the man bores my Lady, who, after a languid effort to listen, or rather a languid resignation of my Lady to a show of listening, becomes distraught and falls into a contemplation of the fire with her screen in her hand as if the fire with her screen in her hand were my Lady fire at Chesney Wold, and my Lady had never left the fire with her screen in her hand. Sir Leicester, quite unconscious, reads on through the man double eye-glass, occasionally stopping to remove his double eye-glass and express approval, as "Very true indeed," "Very properly put," "I have frequently made the same remark my Lady," invariably losing the man place after each observation, and going up and down the column to find the column again. Sir Leicester is reading with infinite gravity and state when the door opens, and the Mercury in powder makes this strange announcement, "The young man, my Lady, of the name of Guppy." Sir Leicester pauses, stares, repeats in a killing voice, "The young man of the name of GuppyGuppy?" Looking round, Sir Leicester beholds the young man of the name of GuppyGuppy, much discomfited and not presenting a very impressive letter of introduction in Sir Leicester manner and appearance. "Pray," says Sir Leicester to the Mercury in powder, "what do you mean by announcing with this abruptness a young man of the name of GuppyGuppy?" "I beg your pardon, Sir Leicester, but my Lady said my Lady would see a young man of the name of Guppy whenever a young man of the name of Guppy called. I was not aware that you were here, Sir Leicester." With this apology, the Mercury in powder directs a scornful and indignant look at Mr. Guppy which plainly says, "What do you come calling here for and getting my Lady into a row?" "It's quite right. I gave a young man of the name of Guppy those directions," says my Ladymy Lady. "Let a young man of the name of Guppy wait." "By no means, my Ladymy Lady. Since a young man of the name of Guppy has your orders to come, I will not interrupt you." Sir Leicester in a young man of the name of Guppy gallantry retires, rather declining to accept a bow from a young man of the name of Guppy as Sir Leicester in his gallantry retires goes out and majestically supposing Sir Leicester in his gallantry retires to be some shoemaker of intrusive appearance. my Lady looks imperiously at my Lady visitor when the servant has left the room, casting my Lady eyes over the servant from head to foot. my Lady suffers the servant to stand by the door and asks the servant what the servant wants. "That your ladyship would have the kindness to oblige me with a little conversation," returns Mr. Guppy, embarrassed. "You are, of course, the person who has written me so many letters?" "Several, your ladyship. Several before your ladyship condescended to favour me with an answer." "And could you not take the same means of rendering a Conversation unnecessary? Can you not still?" Mr. Guppy screws Mr. Guppy mouth into a silent "No!" and shakes head to foot. "You have been strangely importunate. If it should appear, after all, that what you have to say does not concern me--and I don't know how it can, and don't expect that it will--you will allow me to cut you short with but little ceremony. Say what you have to say, if you please." My Lady, with a careless toss of her screen, turns her towards the fire again, sitting almost with her back to the young man of the name of Mr. Guppy. "With your ladyship's permission, then," says the young man of the name of Guppy, "I will now enter on my business. Hem! I am, as I told your ladyship in my first letter, in the law. Being in the law, I have learnt the habit of not committing myself in writing, and therefore I did not mention to your ladyship the name of the firm with which I am connected and in which my standing--and I may add income--is tolerably good. I may now state to your ladyship, in confidence, that the name of the firm with which I am connected is Kenge and Carboy, of Lincoln's Inn, which may not be altogether unknown to your ladyship in connexion with the case in Chancery of Jarndyce and Jarndyce." My Lady's figure begins to be expressive of some attention. My Lady's figure has ceased to toss the screen and holds the screen as if My Lady's figure were listening. "Now, I may say to your ladyship at once," says Mr. Guppy, a little emboldened, "it is no matter arising out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce that made me so desirous to speak to your ladyship, which conduct I have no doubt did appear, and does appear, obtrusive--in fact, almost blackguardly." After waiting for a moment to receive some assurance to the contrary, and not receiving any, Mr. Guppy proceeds, "If it had been Jarndyce and Jarndyce, I should have gone at once to your ladyship's solicitor, Mr. Tulkinghorn, of the Fields. I have the pleasure of being acquainted with Mr. Tulkinghorn--at least we move when we meet one another--and if it had been any business of that sort, I should have gone to Mr. Tulkinghorn." my Lady turns a little round and says, "You had better sit down." "Thank your ladyship." Mr. Guppy does so. "Now, your ladyship"-- Mr. Guppy refers to a little slip of paper on which your ladyship"-- Mr. Guppy has made small notes of your ladyship"-- Mr. Guppy line of argument and which seems to involve your ladyship"-- Mr. Guppy in the densest obscurity whenever your ladyship"-- Mr. Guppy looks at it--"I--Oh, yes!--I place your ladyship"-- Mr. Guppy entirely in your ladyship's hands. If your ladyship was to make any complaint to Kenge and Carboy or to Mr. Tulkinghorn of the present visit, I should be placed in a very disagreeable situation. That, I openly admit. Consequently, I rely upon your ladyship's honour." My Lady, with a disdainful gesture of the hand that holds the screen, assures him of him being worth no complaint from Lady. "Thank your ladyship," says Mr. Guppy; "quite satisfactory. Now-- I--dash it!--The fact is that I put down a head or two here of the order of the points I thought of touching upon, and they're written short, and I can't quite make out what they mean. If your ladyship will excuse me taking your ladyship to the window half a moment, I--" Mr. Guppy, going to the window, tumbles into a pair of love-birds, to whom your ladyship says in your ladyship confusion, "I beg your pardon, I am sure." This does not tend to the greater legibility of your ladyship notes. your ladyship murmurs, growing warm and red and holding the slip of paper now close to your ladyship eyes, now a long way off, "C.S. What's C.S. for? Oh! C.S.! Oh, I know! Yes, to be sure!" And comes back enlightened. "I am not aware," says Mr. Guppy, standing midway between my Lady and his chair, "whether your ladyship ever happened to hear of, or to see, a young lady of the name of Miss Esther Summerson." his eyes look at his full. "I saw a young lady of that name not long ago. This past autumn." "Now, did a young lady of that name strike your ladyship that a young lady of that name was like anybody?" asks Mr. Guppy, crossing Mr. Guppy arms, holding Mr. Guppy head on one side, and scratching the corner of Mr. Guppy mouth with Mr. Guppy memoranda. my Lady removes my Lady eyes from Mr. Guppy no more. "No." "Not like your ladyship's family?" "No." "I think your ladyship," says Mr. Guppy, "can hardly remember Miss Summerson's face?" "I remember my Lady very well. What has this to do with me?" "your ladyship, I do assure you that having Miss Summerson's image imprinted on my 'eart--which I mention in confidence--I found, when I had the honour of going over your ladyship's mansion of Chesney Wold while on a short out in the county of Lincolnshire with a friend, such a resemblance between Miss Esther Summerson and your ladyship's own portrait that it completely knocked me over, so much so that I didn't at the moment even know what it WAS that knocked me over. And now I have the honour of beholding your ladyship near (I have often, since that, taken the liberty of looking at your ladyship in your carriage in the park, when I dare say you was not aware of me, but I never saw your ladyship so near), it's really more surprising than I thought your ladyship." Young man of the name of Mr. Guppy! There have been times, when ladies lived in strongholds and had unscrupulous attendants within call, when that poor life of yours would NOT have been worth a minute's purchase, with those beautiful eyes looking at you as those beautiful eyes look at this moment. my Lady, slowly using my Lady little hand-screen as a fan, asks my Lady again what my Lady supposes that my Lady taste for likenesses has to do with my Lady. "your ladyship," replies Mr. Guppy, again referring to Mr. Guppy paper, "I am coming to that. Dash these notes! Oh! 'Mrs. Chadband.' Yes." Mr. Guppy draws Mr. Guppy chair a little forward and seats Mr. Guppy again. my Lady reclines in his chair composedly, though with a trifle less of graceful ease than usual perhaps, and never falters in my Lady steady gaze. "A--stop a minute, though!" Mr. Guppy refers again. "E.S. twice? Oh, yes! Yes, I see my way now, right on." Rolling up the slip of paper as an instrument to point Mr. Guppy speech with, Mr. Guppy proceeds. "your ladyship, there is a mystery about Miss Esther Summerson's birth and bringing up. I am informed of that fact because--which I mention in confidence--I know that fact in the way of my profession at Kenge and Carboy's. Now, as I have already mentioned to your ladyship, Miss Summerson's image is imprinted on my 'eart. If I could clear a mystery about Miss Esther Summerson's birth for my Lady, or prove my Lady to be well related, or find that having the honour to be a remote branch of your ladyship's family my Lady had a right to be made a party in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, why, I might make a sort of a claim upon Miss Summerson to look with an eye of more dedicated favour on my proposals than my Lady has exactly done as yet. In fact, as yet my Lady hasn't favoured them at all." A kind of angry smile just dawns upon my Lady's face. "Now, it's a very singular circumstance, your ladyship," says Mr. Guppy, "though one of those circumstances that do fall in the way of us professional men--which I may call Mr. Guppy, for though not admitted, yet I have had a present of my articles made to Mr. Guppy by Kenge and Carboy, on my mother's advancing from the principal of my Lady little income the money for the stamp, which comes heavy--that I have encountered the person who lived as servant with the lady who brought Miss Summerson up before Mr. Jarndyce took charge of my Lady. my Lady was a Miss Barbary, your ladyship." Is the dead colour on my Ladymy Lady's face reflected from the screen which has a green silk ground and which my Lady holds in my Lady raised hand as if my Lady had forgotten it, or is it a dreadful paleness that has fallen on my Lady? "Did your ladyship," says Mr. Guppy, "ever happen to hear of Miss Barbary?" "I don't know. I think so. Yes." "Was Miss Barbary at all connected with your ladyship's family?" my Ladymy Lady's lips move, but they utter nothing. my Lady shakes my Lady head. "NOT connected?" says Mr. Guppy. "Oh! Not to your ladyship's knowledge, perhaps? Ah! But might be? Yes." After each of these interrogatories, my Lady has inclined her head. "Very good! Now, Miss Barbary was extremely close--seems to have been extraordinarily close for a female, females being generally (in common life at least) rather given to conversation--and my witness never had an idea whether my Lady possessed a single relative. On one occasion, and only one, my Lady seems to have been confidential to my witness on a single point, and my Lady then told my Lady that the little girl's real name was not Esther Summerson, but Esther Hawdon." "My God!" Mr. Guppy stares. Lady Dedlock sits before Mr. Guppy looking Mr. Guppy through, with the same dark shade upon Lady Dedlock face, in the same attitude even to the holding of the screen, with My Lady's lips a little apart, my Lady brow a little contracted, but for the moment dead. Mr. Guppy sees my Lady consciousness return, sees a tremor pass across my Lady frame like a ripple over water, sees My Lady's lips shake, sees my Lady compose them by a great effort, sees my Lady force herself back to the knowledge of Mr. Guppy presence and of what Mr. Guppy has said. All this, so quickly, that my Lady exclamation and my Lady dead condition seem to have passed away like the features of those long-preserved dead bodies sometimes opened up in tombs, which, struck by the air like lightning, vanish in a breath. "Your ladyship is acquainted with the name of Hawdon?" "I have heard Your ladyship before." "Name of any collateral or remote branch of Your ladyship's family?" "No." "Now, Your ladyship," says Mr. Guppy, "I come to the last point of the case, so far as I have got the last point of the case up. It's going on, and I shall gather the last point of the case up closer and closer as the last point of the case goes on. Your ladyship must know--if Your ladyship don't happen, by any chance, to know already--that there was found dead at the house of a person named Krook, near Chancery Lane, some time ago, a law-writer in great distress. Upon which law-writer there was an inquest, and which law-writer was an anonymous character, law-writer name being unknown. But, Your ladyship, I have discovered very lately that his name was Hawdon." "And what is THAT to me?" "Aye, your ladyship, that's the question! Now, Your ladyship, a queer thing happened after that man's death. A lady started up, a disguised lady, your ladyship, who went to look at the scene of action and went to look at A lady grave. A lady hired a crossing- sweeping boy to show it A lady. If Your ladyship would wish to have the boy produced in corroboration of this statement, I can lay my hand upon Your ladyship at any time." a crossing- sweeping boy is nothing to my Lady, and my Lady does NOT wish to have a crossing- sweeping boy produced. "Oh, I assure Your ladyship it's a very queer start indeed," says Mr. Guppy. "If you was to hear Mr. Guppy tell about the rings that sparkled on my Lady fingers when my Lady took my Lady glove off, you'd think it quite romantic." There are diamonds glittering on the hand that holds the screen. my Lady my Lady trifles with the screen and makes the screen glitter more, again with that expression which in other times might have been so dangerous to the young man of the name of Mr. Guppy. "It was supposed, your ladyship, that the young man of the name of Guppy left no rag or scrap behind the young man of the name of Guppy by which the young man of the name of Guppy could be possibly identified. But the young man of the name of Guppy did. the young man of the name of Guppy left a bundle of old letters." the screen still goes, as before. All this time her eyes never once release the young man of the name of Guppy. "They were taken and secreted. And to-morrow night, Your ladyship, They will come into my possession." "Still I ask you, what is this to my Lady?" "Your ladyship, I conclude with that." Mr. Guppy rises. "If you think there's enough in this chain of circumstances put together-- in the undoubted strong likeness of A lady to your ladyship, which is a positive fact for a jury; in A lady having been brought up by Miss Barbary; in Miss Barbary stating Miss Summerson's real name to be Hawdon; in Your ladyship's knowing both these names VERY WELL; and in Hawdon's dying as he did--to give Your ladyship a family interest in going further into the case, I will bring these papers here. I don't know what these papers are, except that these papers are old letters: I have never had these papers in my possession yet. I will bring these papers here as soon as I get these papers and go over these papers for the first time with Your ladyship. I have told Your ladyship my object. I have told Your ladyship that I should be placed in a very disagreeable situation if any complaint was made, and all is in strict confidence." Is this the full purpose of the young man of the name of Guppy, or has the young man of the name of Guppy any other? Do the young man of the name of Guppy words disclose the length, breadth, depth, of the young man of the name of Guppy object and suspicion in coming here; or if not, what do not hide? the young man of the name of Guppy is a match for my Lady my Lady there. my Lady may look at the young man of the name of Guppy, but the young man of the name of Guppy can look at the table and keep that witness-box face of the young man of the name of Guppy from telling anything. "You may bring the letters," says my Ladymy Lady, "if you choose." "Your ladyship is not very encouraging, upon my word and honour," says Mr. Guppy, a little injured. "You may bring the letters," my Lady repeats in the same tone, "if you --please." "It shall the young man of the name of Guppy done. I wish Your ladyship good day." On a table near my Lady is a rich bauble of a casket, barred and clasped like an old strong-chest. my Lady, looking at the young man of the name of Guppy still, takes it to my Lady and unlocks it. "Oh! I assure Your ladyship I am not actuated by any motives of that sort," says Mr. Guppy, "and I couldn't accept anything of the kind. I wish Your ladyship good day, and am much obliged to you all the same." So the young man makes the young man bow and goes downstairs, where the supercilious Mercury does not consider the young man called upon to leave the young man Olympus by the hall-fire to let the young man out. As Sir Leicester basks in Sir Leicester library and dozes over Sir Leicester newspaper, is there no influence in the house to startle Sir Leicester, not to say to make the very trees at Chesney Wold fling up the very trees at Chesney Wold knotted arms, the very portraits frown, the very armour stir? No. Words, sobs, and cries are but air, and air is so shut in and shut out throughout the house in town that sounds need be uttered trumpet-tongued indeed by my Lady my Lady in my Lady chamber to carry any faint vibration to Sir Leicester's ears; and yet this cry is in the house, going upward from a wild figure on this cry knees. "O my child, my child! Not dead in the first hours of my Lady life, as my cruel sister told me, but sternly nurtured by my Lady, after my Lady had renounced me and my name! O my child, O my child!"
