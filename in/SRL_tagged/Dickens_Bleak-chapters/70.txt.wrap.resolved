The Close of Esther's Narrative Full seven happy years I have been the mistress of Bleak House. The few words that I have to add to what I have written are soon penned; then I and the unknown friend to whom I write will part for ever. Not without much dear remembrance on my side. Not without some, I hope, on his or hers. his or gave my darling into my arms, and through many weeks I never left my darling. The little child who was to have done so much was born before the turf was planted on The little child who was to have done so much father's grave. It was a boy; and I, my husband, and my guardian gave a boy a boy father's name. The help that my dear counted on did come to my dear, though it came, in the eternal wisdom, for another purpose. Though to bless and restore a boy mother, not a boy father, was the errand of this baby, the errand of this baby power was mighty to do the errand of this baby. When I saw the strength of the weak little hand and how the errand of this baby touch could heal my darling's heart and raised hope within my dear, I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of God. They throve, and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country garden and walk there with my dear girl infant in my dear girl arms. I was married then. I was the happiest of the happy. It was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked Ada when Ada would come home. "Both houses are your home, my dear," said my dear, "but the older Bleak House claims priority. When you and my boy are strong enough to do the older Bleak House claims priority, come and take possession of your home." Ada called my boy "Ada dearest cousin, John." But my boy said, no, it must be guardian now. my boy was her guardian henceforth, and my boy's; and my boy had an old association with the name. So my dear girl called my boy guardian, and has called my boy guardian ever since. The children know my boy by no other name. I say The children; I have two little daughters. It is difficult to believe that Charley (round-eyed still, and not at all grammatical) is married to a miller in our neighbourhood; yet so it is; and even now, looking up from my desk as I write early in the morning at my summer window, I see the very mill beginning to go round. I hope a miller in our neighbourhood will not spoil Charley; but a miller in our neighbourhood is very fond of Charley, and Charley is rather vain of such a match, for a miller in our neighbourhood is well to do and was in great request. So far as my small maid is concerned, I might suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the very mill did half an hour ago, since little Emma, Charley's sister, is exactly what Charley used to be. As to Tom, Charley's brother, I am really afraid to say what Tom did at school in ciphering, but I think it was decimals. Tom is apprenticed to a miller in our neighbourhood, whatever it was, and is a good bashful fellow, always falling in love with somebody and being ashamed of it. Caddy Jellyby passed Caddy Jellyby very last holidays with us and was a dearer creature than ever, perpetually dancing in and out of the house with the children as if Caddy Jellyby had never given a dancing-lesson in Caddy Jellyby life. Caddy Jellyby keeps Caddy Jellyby own little carriage now instead of hiring one, and lives full two miles further westward than Newman Street. Caddy Jellyby works very hard, Caddy Jellyby husband (an excellent one) being lame and able to do very little. Still, Caddy Jellyby is more than contented and does all Caddy Jellyby has to do with all Caddy Jellyby heart. Caddy Jellyby spends Caddy Jellyby evenings at Caddy Jellyby new house with Caddy Jellyby head against the wall as Caddy Jellyby used to do in Caddy Jellyby old one. I have heard that Caddy Jellyby was understood to suffer great mortification from Caddy Jellyby daughter's ignoble marriage and pursuits, but I hope Caddy Jellyby got over it in time. Caddy Jellyby has been disappointed in Borrioboola-Gha, which turned out a failure in consequence of the king of Borrioboola wanting to sell everybody--who survived the climate--for rum, but Caddy Jellyby has taken up with the rights of women to sit in Parliament, and Caddy tells me it is a mission involving more correspondence than the old one. I had almost forgotten Caddy's poor little girl. Caddy's poor little girl is not such a mite now, but Caddy's poor little girl is deaf and dumb. I believe there never was a better mother than Caddy, who learns, in Caddy's poor little girl scanty intervals of leisure, innumerable deaf and dumb arts to soften the affliction of Caddy's poor little girl child. As if I were never to have done with Caddy, I am reminded here of Peepy and old Mr. Turveydrop. Peepy is in the Custom House, and doing extremely well. Old Mr. Turveydrop, very apoplectic, still exhibits Peepy deportment about town, still enjoys Peepy in the old manner, is still believed in in the old way. Peepy is constant in Peepy patronage of Peepy and is understood to have bequeathed Peepy a favourite French clock in Peepy dressing-room--which is not Peepy property. With the first money we saved at home, we added to we pretty house by throwing out a little growlery expressly for my guardian, which we inaugurated with great splendour the next time Peepy came down to see we. I try to write all this lightly, because my heart is full in drawing to an end, but when I write of Peepy, my tears will have their way. I never look at Peepy but I hear we poor dear Richard calling Peepy a good man. To Ada and Ada pretty boy, Peepy is the fondest father; to our poor dear Richard Peepy is what Peepy has ever been, and what name can I give to that? Peepy is my husband's best and dearest friend, Peepy is our children's darling, Peepy is the object of our deepest love and veneration. Yet while I feel towards Peepy as if Peepy were a superior being, I am so familiar with Peepy and so easy with Peepy that I almost wonder at our poor dear Richard. I have never lost my old names, nor has Peepy lost Peepy; nor do I ever, when Peepy is with our, sit in any other place than in my old chair at Peepy side, Dame Trot, Dame Durden, Little Woman--all just the same as ever; and I answer, "Yes, dear guardian!" just the same. I have never known the wind to be in the east for a single moment since the day when Peepy took me to the porch to read the name. I remarked to Peepy once that the wind seemed never in the east now, and Peepy said, no, truly; the wind had finally departed from that quarter on that very day. I think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever. The sorrow that has been in my darling girl face--for it is not there now--seems to have purified even it innocent expression and to have given it a diviner quality. Sometimes when I raise my eyes and see my darling girl in the black dress that my darling girl still wears, teaching my Richard, I feel--it is difficult to express--as if it were so good to know that my darling girl remembers my darling girl dear Esther in my darling girl prayers. I call my Richard my Richardmy Richard! But my Richard says that my Richard has two mamas, and I am one. We are not rich in the bank, but We have always prospered, and We have quite enough. I never walk out with my husband but I hear the people bless my husband. I never go into a house of any degree but I hear my husband praises or see the people in my eyes. I never lie down at night but I know that in the course of that day my husband has alleviated pain and soothed some fellow-creature in the time of need. I know that from the beds of those who were past recovery, thanks have often, often gone up, in the last hour, for my husband patient ministration. Is not this to be rich? the people even praise me as the doctor's wife. the people even like me as I go about, and make so much of my Richard that I am quite abashed. I owe it all to my husband, my love, my pride! the people like me for my husband sake, as I do everything I do in life for his sake. A night or two ago, after bustling about preparing for my darling and my guardian and little Richard, who are coming to-morrow, I was sitting out in the porch of all places, that dearly memorable porch, when Allan came home. So Allan said, "My precious little woman, what are you doing here?" And I said, "The moon is shining so brightly, Allan, and the night is so delicious, that I have been sitting here thinking." "What have you been thinking about, my dear?" said Allan then. "How curious you are!" said I. "I am almost ashamed to tell you, but I will. I have been thinking about my old looks--such as they were." "And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?" said Allan. "I have been thinking that I thought it was impossible that you COULD have loved me any better, even if I had retained THEM." "'Such as THEM were'?" said Allan, laughing. "Such as THEM were, of course." "My dear Dame Durden," said Allan, drawing my arm through Allan, "do you ever look in the glass?" "You know I do; you see me do my arm." "And don't you know that you are prettier than you ever were?" "I did not know that; I am not certain that I know it now. But I know that my dearest little pets are very pretty, and that my darling is very beautiful, and that my husband is very handsome, and that my guardian has the brightest and most benevolent face that ever was seen, and that they can very well do without much beauty in me--even supposing--."
