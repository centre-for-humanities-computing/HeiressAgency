The Appointed Time It is night in Lincoln's Inn--perplexed and troublous valley of the shadow of the law, where suitors generally find but little day--and fat candles are snuffed out in offices, and clerks have rattled down the crazy wooden stairs and dispersed.
The bell that rings at nine o'clock has ceased The bell that rings at nine o'clock doleful clangour about nothing; the gates are shut; and the night-porter, a solemn warder with a mighty power of sleep, keeps guard in his lodge.
From tiers of staircase windows clogged lamps like the eyes of Equity, bleared Argus with a fathomless pocket for every eye and an eye upon it, dimly blink at the stars.
In dirty upper casements, here and there, hazy little patches of candlelight reveal where some wise draughtsman and conveyancer yet toils for the entanglement of real estate in meshes of sheep-skin, in the average ratio of about a dozen of sheep to an acre of land.
Over which bee-like industry these benefactors of their species linger yet, though office-hours be past, that their may give, for every day, some good account at last.
In the neighbouring court, where the Lord Chancellor of the rag and bottle shop dwells, there is a general tendency towards beer and supper.
Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins, whose respective sons, engaged with a circle of acquaintance in the game of hide and seek, have been lying in ambush about the by-ways of Chancery Lane for some hours and scouring the plain of the same thoroughfare to the confusion of passengers--Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins have but now exchanged congratulations on the children being abed, and Piper and Mrs. Perkins still linger on a door-step over a few parting words.
Mr. Krook and his lodger, and the fact of Mr. Krook's being "continually in liquor," and the testamentary prospects of the young man are, as usual, the staple of Mr. Krook and his lodger, and the fact of Mr. Krook's being "continually in liquor," and the testamentary prospects of the young man conversation.
But Mr. Krook and his lodger, and the fact of Mr. Krook's being "continually in liquor," and the testamentary prospects of the young man have something to say, likewise, of the Harmonic Meeting at the Sol's Arms, where the sound of the piano through the partly opened windows jingles out into the court, and where Little Swills, after keeping the lovers of harmony in a roar like a very Yorick, may now be heard taking the gruff line in a concerted piece and sentimentally adjuring his friends and patrons to "Listen, listen, listen, tew the wa-ter fall!"
Piper and Mrs. Perkins compare opinions on the subject of the young lady of professional celebrity who assists at the Harmonic Meetings and who has a space to Mrs. Piper in the manuscript announcement in the window, Mrs. Piper possessing information that Mrs. Piper has been married a year and a half, though announced as Miss M. Melvilleson, the noted siren, and that Mrs. Piper baby is clandestinely conveyed to the Sol's Arms every night to receive the Sol's Arms natural nourishment during the entertainments.
"Sooner than which, Mrs. Piper," says Mrs. Piper, "I would get my living by selling lucifers."
Mrs. Piper, as in duty bound, is of the same opinion, holding that a private station is better than public applause, and thanking heaven for Mrs. Piper own (and, by implication, Mrs. Piper respectability.
By this time the pot-boy of the Sol's Arms appearing with Mrs. Piper supper-pint well frothed, Mrs. Piper accepts that tankard and retires indoors, first giving a fair good night to Mrs. Perkins, who has had Mrs. Piper own pint in Mrs. Piper hand ever since it was fetched from the same hostelry by Mrs. Piper before the pot-boy of the Sol's Arms was sent to bed.
Now there is a sound of putting up shop- shutters in the court and a smell as of the smoking of pipes; and shooting stars are seen in upper windows, further indicating retirement to rest.
Now, too, the policeman begins to push at doors; to try fastenings; to be suspicious of bundles; and to administer the policeman beat, on the hypothesis that every one is either robbing or being robbed.
It is a close night, though the damp cold is searching too, and there is a laggard mist a little way up in the air.
It is a fine steaming night to turn the slaughter-houses, the unwholesome trades, the sewerage, bad water, and burial-grounds to account, and give the registrar of deaths some extra business.
It may be something in the air--there is plenty in it--or it may be something in something in himself that is in fault that is in fault; but Mr. Weevle, otherwise Jobling, is very ill at ease.
something in himself that is in fault comes and goes between something in himself that is in fault own room and the open street door twenty times an hour.
something in himself that is in fault has been doing so ever since it fell dark.
Since the Chancellor shut up something in himself that is in fault shop, which something in himself that is in fault did very early to-night, Mr. Weevle has been down and up, and down and up (with a cheap tight velvet skull-cap on Mr. Weevle head, making Mr. Weevle whiskers look out of all proportion), oftener than before.
It is no phenomenon that Mr. Snagsby should be ill at ease too, for Mr. Snagsby always is so, more or less, under the oppressive influence of the secret that is upon Mr. Snagsby.
Impelled by the mystery of which Mr. Snagsby is a partaker and yet in which Mr. Snagsby is not a sharer, Mr. Snagsby haunts what seems to be its fountain-head--the rag and bottle shop in the court.
its has an irresistible attraction for Mr. Snagsby.
Even now, coming round by the Sol's Arms with the intention of passing down the court, and out at the Chancery Lane end, and so terminating Mr. Snagsby unpremeditated after-supper stroll of ten minutes' long from Mr. Snagsby own door and back again, Mr. Snagsby approaches.
"What, Mr.
Weevle?"
says the stationer, stopping to speak.
"Are YOU there?"
"Aye!"
says Mr. Weevle, "Here I am, Mr.
Snagsby."
"Airing yourself, as I am doing, before you go to bed?"
the stationer inquires.
"Why, there's not much air to be got here; and what there is, is not very freshening," Weevle answers, glancing up and down the court.
"Very true, sir.
Don't you observe," says Mr. Snagsby, pausing to sniff and taste the air a little, "don't you observe, Mr. Weevle, that you're--not to put too fine a point upon it--that you're rather greasy here, sir?"
"Why, I have noticed sir that there is a queer kind of flavour in the place to-night,Mr.
Weevle rejoins.
"I suppose it's chops at the Sol's Arms."
"Chops, do you think?
Oh!
Chops, eh?"
Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes again.
"Well, sir, I suppose it is.
But I should say their cook at the Sol wanted a little looking after.
their cook at the Sol has been burning 'em, sir!
And I don't think"--Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes again and then spits and wipes his mouth--"I don't think-- not to put too fine a point upon his mouth--"I--that they were quite fresh when they were shown the gridiron."
"That's very likely.
It's a tainting sort of weather."
"It IS a tainting sort of weather," says Mr. Snagsby, "and I find it sinking to the spirits."
"By George!
I find it gives me the horrors," returns Mr. Weevle.
"Then, you see, you live in a lonesome way, and in a lonesome room, with a black circumstance hanging over it," says Mr. Snagsby, looking in past the other's shoulder along the dark passage and then falling back a step to look up at the house.
"I couldn't live in that room alone, as you do, sir.
I should get so fidgety and worried of an evening, sometimes, that I should be driven to come to the door and stand here sooner than sit there.
But then it's very true that you didn't see, in your room, what I saw there.
That makes a difference."
"I know quite enough about it," returns Tony.
"It's not agreeable, is It?"
pursues Mr. Snagsby, coughing Mr. Snagsby cough of mild persuasion behind Mr. Snagsby hand.
"Mr. Krook ought to consider it in the rent.
I hope Mr. Krook does, I am sure."
"I hope Mr. Krook does," says Tony.
"But I doubt it."
"You find the rent too high, do you, sir?"
returns the stationer.
"Rents ARE high about here.
I don't know how it is exactly, but the law seems to put things up in price.
Not," adds Mr. Snagsby with Mr. Snagsby apologetic cough, "that I mean to say a word against the profession I get my living by."
Mr. Weevle again glances up and down the court and then looks at the stationer.
Mr. Snagsby, blankly catching Mr. Snagsby eye, looks upward for a star or so and coughs a cough expressive of not exactly seeing Mr. Snagsby way out of this conversation.
"It's a curious fact, sir," Mr. Snagsby observes, slowly rubbing Mr. Snagsby hands, "that Mr. Snagsby should have been--" "Who's Mr.
Snagsby?"
interrupts Mr. Weevle.
"The deceased, you know," says Mr. Snagsby, twitching Mr. Snagsby head and right eyebrow towards the staircase and tapping Mr. Snagsby acquaintance on the button.
"Ah, to be sure!"
returns the other as if Mr. Snagsby were not over-fond of the subject.
"I thought we had done with Mr.
Snagsby."
"I was only going to say it's a curious fact, sir, that Mr. Snagsby should have come and lived here, and been one of my writers, and then that you should come and live here, and be one of my writers too.
Which there is nothing derogatory, but far from it in the appellation," says Mr. Snagsby, breaking off with a mistrust that Mr. Snagsby may have unpolitely asserted a kind of proprietorship in Mr. Weevle, "because I have known writers that have gone into brewers' houses and done really very respectable indeed.
Eminently respectable, sir," adds Mr. Snagsby with a misgiving that Mr. Snagsby has not improved the matter.
"It's a curious coincidence, as you say," answers Weevle, once more glancing up and down the court.
"Seems a fate in it, don't there?"
suggests the stationer.
"There does."
"Just so," observes the stationer with his confirmatory cough.
"Quite a fate in it.
Quite a fate.
Well, Mr. Weevle, I am afraid I must bid you good night"--Mr. Mr. Snagsby speaks as if Mr. Snagsby made Mr. Snagsby desolate to go, though Mr. Snagsby has been casting about for any means of escape ever since Mr. Snagsby stopped to speak--"my little woman will be looking for me else.
Good night, sir!"
If Mr. Snagsby hastens home to save little woman the trouble of looking for Mr. Snagsby, Mr. Snagsby might set Mr. Snagsby mind at rest on that score.
little woman has had little woman eye upon Mr. Snagsby round the Sol's Arms all this time and now glides after Mr. Snagsby with a pocket handkerchief wrapped over little woman head, honouring Mr. Weevle and Mr. Snagsby doorway with a searching glance as little woman goes past.
"You'll know me again, ma'am, at all events," says Mr. Weevle to Mr. Weevle; "and I can't compliment you on your appearance, whoever you are, with your head tied up in a bundle.
Is Mr. Weevle NEVER coming!"
Mr. Weevle approaches as Mr. Weevle speaks.
Mr. Weevle softly holds up Mr. Weevle finger, and draws Mr. Weevle into the passage, and closes the street door.
Then they go upstairs, Mr. Weevle heavily, and Mr. Guppy (for it is Mr. Weevle) very lightly indeed.
When they are shut into the back room, they speak low.
"I thought you had gone to Jericho at least instead of coming here," says Tony.
"Why, I said about ten."
"You said about ten," Tony repeats.
"Yes, so you did say about ten.
But according to my count, it's ten times ten--it's a hundred o'clock.
I never had such a night in my life!"
"What has been the matter?"
"That's it!"
says Tony.
"Nothing has been the matter.
But here have I been stewing and fuming in this jolly old crib till I have had the horrors falling on me as thick as hail.
THERE'S a blessed- looking candle!"
says Tony, pointing to the heavily burning taper on Tony table with a great cabbage head and a long winding-sheet.
"That's easily improved," Mr. Guppy observes as " Mr. Guppy takes the snuffers in hand.
"IS it?"
returns his friend.
"Not so easily as you think.
It has been smouldering like that ever since It was lighted."
"Why, what's the matter with you, Tony?"
inquires " Mr. Guppy, looking at " Mr. Guppy, snuffers in hand, as " Mr. Guppy sits down with " Mr. Guppy elbow on the table. ""
Mr. Guppy," replies the other, "I am in the downs.
It's this unbearably dull, suicidal room--and old Boguey downstairs, I suppose."
Mr. Weevle moodily pushes the snuffers-tray from Mr. Weevle with Mr. Weevle elbow, leans Mr. Weevle head on Mr. Weevle hand, puts Mr. Weevle feet on the fender, and looks at the fire. "
Mr. Guppy, observing " Mr. Guppy, slightly tosses his head and sits down on the other side of the table in an easy attitude.
"Wasn't that Mr. Snagsby talking to you, Tony?"
"Yes, and Tony--yes, it was Snagsby," said Mr. Weevle, altering the construction of Mr. Weevle sentence.
"On business?"
"No.
No business.
Mr. Weevle was only sauntering by and stopped to prose."
"I thought it was Mr. Snagsby," says " Mr. Guppy, "and thought it as well that Mr. Weevle shouldn't see me, so I waited till Mr. Weevle was gone."
"There we go again, William G.!"
cried Tony, looking up for an instant.
"So mysterious and secret!
By George, if we were going to commit a murder, we couldn't have more mystery about it!"
" Mr. Guppy affects to smile, and with the view of changing the conversation, looks with an admiration, real or pretended, round the room at the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty, terminating " Mr. Guppy survey with the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the mantelshelf, in which Lady Dedlock is represented on a terrace, with a pedestal upon the terrace, and a vase upon the pedestal, and Lady Dedlock shawl upon the vase, and a prodigious piece of fur upon the shawl, and Lady Dedlock arm on the prodigious piece of fur, and a bracelet on Lady Dedlock arm.
"That's very like Lady Dedlock," says " Mr. Guppy.
"It's a speaking likeness."
"I wish It was," growls Tony, without changing Tony position.
"I should have some fashionable conversation, here, then."
Finding by this time that Tony friend is not to be wheedled into a more sociable humour, " Mr. Guppy puts about upon the ill-used tack and remonstrates with " Mr. Guppy.
"Tony," says Tony, "I can make allowances for lowness of spirits, for no man knows what it is when it does come upon a man better than I do, and no man perhaps has a better right to know it than a man who has an unrequited image imprinted on no man 'eart.
But there are bounds to these things when an unoffending party is in question, and I will acknowledge to you, Tony, that I don't think your manner on the present occasion is hospitable or quite gentlemanly."
"This is strong language, " Mr. Guppy," returns Mr. Weevle.
"sir, it may be," retorts " Mr. Guppy, "but I feel strongly when I use it."
Mr. Weevle admits that Mr. Weevle has been wrong and begs " Mr. Guppy to think no more about it. "
Mr. Guppy, however, having got the advantage, cannot quite release it without a little more injured remonstrance.
"No!
Dash it, Tony," says that gentleman, "you really ought to be careful how you wound the feelings of a man who has an unrequited image imprinted on his 'eart and who is NOT altogether happy in those chords which vibrate to the tenderest emotions.
You, Tony, possess in yourself all that is calculated to charm the eye and allure the taste.
It is not--happily for you, perhaps, and I may wish that I could say the same--It is not your character to hover around one flower.
The ole garden is open to you, and your airy pinions carry you through The ole garden.
Still, Tony, far be The ole garden from Tony, I am sure, to wound even your feelings without a cause!"
Tony again entreats that the subject may be no longer pursued, saying emphatically, "William Guppy, drop it!"
" Mr. Guppy acquiesces, with the reply, "I never should have taken it up, Tony, of my own accord."
"And now," says Tony, stirring the fire, "touching this same bundle of letters.
Isn't it an extraordinary thing of Krook to have appointed twelve o'clock to-night to hand 'em over to Tony?"
"Very.
What did he do it for?"
"What does he do anything for?
he don't know.
Said to-day was he birthday and he'd hand 'em over to-night at twelve o'clock.
he'll have drunk he blind by that time.
he has been at it all day."
"he hasn't forgotten the appointment, I hope?"
"Forgotten?
Trust he for that.
he never forgets anything.
I saw he to-night, about eight--helped he to shut up he shop--and he had got the letters then in he hairy cap.
he pulled his hairy cap off and showed 'em me.
When his shop was closed, he took his shop out of his hairy cap, hung he cap on the chair-back, and stood turning his shop over before the fire.
I heard he a little while afterwards, through the floor here, humming like the wind, the only song he knows-- about Bibo, and old Charon, and Bibo being drunk when he died, or something or other.
he has been as quiet since as an old rat asleep in he hole."
"And you are to go down at twelve?"
"At twelve.
And as I tell you, when you came it seemed to me a hundred."
"Tony," says " Mr. Guppy after considering a little with " Mr. Guppy legs crossed, "" Mr. Guppy can't read yet, can " Mr.
Guppy?"
"Read! "
Mr. Guppy'll never read. "
Mr. Guppy can make all the letters separately, and " Mr. Guppy knows most of all the letters separately when " Mr. Guppy sees all the letters; " Mr. Guppy has got on that much, under " Mr. Guppy; but " Mr. Guppy can't put all the letters together. "
Mr. Guppy's too old to acquire the knack of it now--and too drunk."
"Tony," says Mr. Guppy, uncrossing and recrossing " Mr. Guppy legs, "how do you suppose " Mr. Guppy spelt out that name of Hawdon?"
"" Mr. Guppy never spelt that name of Hawdon out.
You know what a curious power of eye " Mr. Guppy has and how " Mr. Guppy has been used to employ " Mr. Guppy in copying things by eye alone. "
Mr. Guppy imitated it, evidently from the direction of a letter, and asked me what it meant."
"Tony," says Mr. Guppy, uncrossing and recrossing " Mr. Guppy legs again, "should you say that the original was a man's writing or a woman's?"
"A woman's.
Fifty to one a lady's--slopes a good deal, and the end of the letter 'n,' long and hasty."
" Mr. Guppy has been biting " Mr. Guppy thumb-nail during this dialogue, generally changing the thumb when " Mr. Guppy has changed the cross leg.
As " Mr. Guppy is going to do so again, " Mr. Guppy happens to look at " Mr. Guppy coat-sleeve.
It takes " Mr. Guppy attention. "
Mr. Guppy stares at It, aghast.
"Why, Tony, what on earth is going on in this house to-night?
Is there a chimney on fire?"
"Chimney on fire!"
"Ah!"
returns " Mr. Guppy.
"See how the soot's falling.
See here, on my arm!
See again, on the table here!
Confound the stuff, it won't blow off--smears like black fat!"
They look at one another, and Tony goes listening to the door, and a little way upstairs, and a little way downstairs.
Comes back and says it's all right and all quiet, and quotes the remark Tony lately made to Mr. Snagsby about their cooking chops at the Sol's Arms.
"And it was then," resumes Mr. Guppy, still glancing with remarkable aversion at his coat-sleeve, as they pursue they conversation before the fire, leaning on opposite sides of the table, with they heads very near together, "that Tony told you of Tony having taken the bundle of letters from Tony lodger's portmanteau?"
"That was the time, sir," answers Tony, faintly adjusting Tony whiskers.
"Whereupon I wrote a line to my dear boy, the Honourable William Guppy, informing Whereupon of the appointment for to-night and advising Whereupon not to call before, Boguey being a slyboots."
The light vivacious tone of fashionable life which is usually assumed by Mr. Weevle sits so ill upon Mr. Weevle to-night that Mr. Weevle abandons that and his whiskers together, and after looking over Mr. Weevle shoulder, appears to yield Mr. Weevle up a prey to the horrors again.
"You are to bring the letters to your room to read and compare, and to get yourself into a position to tell him all about the letters.
That's the arrangement, isn't it, Tony?"
asks " Mr. Guppy, anxiously biting his thumb-nail.
"You can't speak too low.
Yes.
That's what " Mr. Guppy and I agreed."
"I tell you what, Tony--" "You can't speak too low," says Tony once more. "
Mr. Guppy nods " Mr. Guppy sagacious head, advances it yet closer, and drops into a whisper.
"I tell you what.
The first thing to be done is to make another packet like the real one so that if Tony should ask to see the real one while it's in my possession, you can show Tony the dummy."
"And suppose Tony detects the dummy as soon as Tony sees it, which with Tony biting screw of an eye is about five hundred times more likely than not," suggests Tony.
"Then we'll face it out.
They don't belong to Tony, and They never did.
You found that, and you placed They in my hands--a legal friend of yours--for security.
If he forces we to it, They'll be producible, won't They?"
"Ye-es," is Mr. Weevle's reluctant admission.
"Why, Tony," remonstrates Tony friend, "how you look!
You don't doubt " Mr. Guppy?
You don't suspect any harm?"
"I don't suspect anything more than I know, William," returns the other gravely.
"And what do you know?"
urges " Mr. Guppy, raising " Mr. Guppy voice a little; but on his friend's once more warning " Mr. Guppy, "I tell you, you can't speak too low," " Mr. Guppy repeats " Mr. Guppy question without any sound at all, forming with " Mr. Guppy lips only the words, "What do you know?"
"I know three things.
First, I know that here we are whispering in secrecy, a pair of conspirators."
"Well!"
says " Mr. Guppy.
"And we had better be that than a pair of noodles, which we should be if we were doing anything else, for it's the only way of doing what we want to do.
Secondly?"
"Secondly, it's not made out to me how it's likely to be profitable, after all."
" Mr. Guppy casts up " Mr. Guppy eyes at the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the mantelshelf and replies, "Tony, you are asked to leave that to the honour of his friend.
Besides its being calculated to serve his friend in those chords of the human mind which--which need not be called into agonizing vibration on the present occasion--his friend is no fool.
What's that?"
"It's eleven o'clock striking by the bell of Saint Paul's.
Listen and you'll hear all the bells in the city jangling."
Both sit silent, listening to the metal voices, near and distant, resounding from towers of various heights, in tones more various than Both situations.
When these at length cease, all seems more mysterious and quiet than before.
One disagreeable result of whispering is that it seems to evoke an atmosphere of silence, haunted by the ghosts of sound--strange cracks and tickings, the rustling of garments that have no substance in garments, and the tread of dreadful feet that would leave no mark on the sea-sand or the winter snow.
So sensitive the two friends happen to be that the air is full of these phantoms, and the two look over the two friends shoulders by one consent to see that the door is shut.
"Yes, Tony?"
says " Mr. Guppy, drawing nearer to the fire and biting " Mr. Guppy unsteady thumb-nail.
"You were going to say, thirdly?"
"It's far from a pleasant thing to be plotting about a dead man in the room where " Mr. Guppy died, especially when you happen to live in it."
"But we are plotting nothing against " Mr. Guppy, Tony."
"May be not, still I don't like it.
Live here by " Mr. Guppy and see how YOU like it."
"As to dead men, Tony," proceeds " Mr. Guppy, evading this proposal, "there have been dead men in most rooms."
"I know there have, but in most rooms you let dead men alone, and--and dead men let you alone," Tony answers.
The two look at each other again. "
Mr. Guppy makes a hurried remark to the effect that dead men may be doing the deceased a service, that " Mr. Guppy hopes so.
There is an oppressive blank until Mr. Weevle, by stirring the fire suddenly, makes " Mr. Guppy start as if " Mr. Guppy heart had been stirred instead.
"Fah!
Here's more of this hateful soot hanging about," says " Mr. Guppy.
"Let us open the window a bit and get a mouthful of air.
It's too close."
" Mr. Guppy raises the sash, and they both rest on the window-sill, half in and half out of the room.
The neighbouring houses are too near to admit of The neighbouring houses seeing any sky without craning The neighbouring houses necks and looking up, but lights in frowsy windows here and there, and the rolling of distant carriages, and the new expression that there is of the stir of men, The neighbouring houses find to be comfortable. "
Mr. Guppy, noiselessly tapping on the window-sill, resumes " Mr. Guppy whispering in quite a light-comedy tone.
"By the by, Tony, don't forget old Smallweed," meaning the younger of that name.
"I have not let " Mr. Guppy into this, you know.
That grandfather of " Mr. Guppy is too keen by half.
That grandfather of his runs in the family."
"I remember," says Tony.
"I am up to all that."
"And as to Krook," resumes " Mr. Guppy.
"Now, do you suppose " Mr. Guppy really has got hold of any other papers of importance, as " Mr. Guppy has boasted to you, since you have been such allies?"
Tony shakes Tony head.
"I don't know.
Can't Imagine.
If we get through this business without rousing " Mr. Guppy suspicions, I shall be better informed, no doubt.
How can I know without seeing we get through this business without rousing his suspicions, when " Mr. Guppy don't know " Mr. Guppy? "
Mr. Guppy is always spelling out words from we get through this business without rousing his suspicions, and chalking we get through this business without rousing his suspicions over the table and the shop-wall, and asking what this is and what that is; but " Mr. Guppy whole stock from beginning to end may easily be the waste-paper " Mr. Guppy bought it as, for anything I can say.
It's a monomania with " Mr. Guppy to think " Mr. Guppy is possessed of documents. "
Mr. Guppy has been going to learn to read documents this last quarter of a century, I should judge, from what " Mr. Guppy tells me."
"How did " Mr. Guppy first come by that idea, though?
That's the question," " Mr. Guppy suggests with one eye shut, after a little forensic meditation. ""
Mr. Guppy may have found papers in something " Mr. Guppy bought, where papers were not supposed to be, and may have got it into " Mr. Guppy shrewd head from the manner and place of their concealment that their are worth something."
"Or " Mr. Guppy may have been taken in, in some pretended bargain.
Or " Mr. Guppy may have been muddled altogether by long staring at whatever " Mr. Guppy HAS got, and by drink, and by hanging about the Lord Chancellor's Court and hearing of documents for ever," returns Mr. Weevle. "
Mr. Guppy sitting on the window-sill, nodding his head and balancing all these possibilities in " Mr. Guppy mind, continues thoughtfully to tap it, and clasp it, and measure it with " Mr. Guppy hand, until " Mr. Guppy hastily draws his hand away.
"What, in the devil's name," " Mr. Guppy says, "is this!
Look at my fingers!"
A thick, yellow liquor defiles them, which is offensive to the touch and sight and more offensive to the smell.
A stagnant, sickening oil with some natural repulsion in it that makes them both shudder.
"What have you been doing here?
What have you been pouring out of window?"
"I pouring out of window!
Nothing, I swear!
Never, since I have been here!"
cries the lodger.
And yet look here--and look here!
When the lodger brings the candle here, from the corner of the window-sill, the candle slowly drips and creeps away down the bricks, here lies in a little thick nauseous pool.
"This is a horrible house," says " Mr. Guppy, shutting down the window.
"Give me some water or I shall cut my hand off."
the lodger so washes, and rubs, and scrubs, and smells, and washes, that the lodger has not long restored the lodger with a glass of brandy and stood silently before the fire when Saint Paul's bell strikes twelve and all those other bells strike twelve from their towers of various heights in the dark air, and in their many tones.
When all is quiet again, the lodger says, "It's the appointed time at last.
Shall I go?"
" Mr. Guppy nods and gives " Mr. Guppy a "lucky touch" on the back, but not with the washed hand, though it is " Mr. Guppy right hand. "
Mr. Guppy goes downstairs, and " Mr. Guppy tries to compose " Mr. Guppy before the fire for waiting a long time.
But in no more than a minute or two the stairs creak and Tony comes swiftly back.
"Have you got them?"
"Got them!
No.
The old man's not there."
The old man has been so horribly frightened in the short interval that The old man terror seizes the other, who makes a rush at The old man and asks loudly, "What's the matter?"
"I couldn't make The old man hear, and I softly opened the door and looked in.
And the burning smell is there--and the soot is there, and the oil is there--and The old man is not there!"
Tony ends this with a groan. "
Mr. Guppy takes the light.
They go down, more dead than alive, and holding one another, push open the door of the back shop.
The cat has retreated close to The cat and stands snarling, not at They, at something on the ground before the fire.
There is a very little fire left in the grate, but there is a smouldering, suffocating vapour in the room and a dark, greasy coating on the walls and ceiling.
The chairs and table, and the bottle so rarely absent from the table, all stand as usual.
On one chair-back hang the old man's hairy cap and coat.
"Look!"
whispers the lodger, pointing his friend's attention to these objects with a trembling finger.
"I told you so.
When I saw his last, his took his cap off, took out the little bundle of old letters, hung his cap on the back of the chair--his was there already, for his had pulled that off before his went to put the shutters up--and I left his turning old letters over in his , standing just where that crumbled black thing is upon the floor."
Is his hanging somewhere?
They look up.
No.
"See!"
whispers Tony.
"At the foot of the chair there lies a dirty bit of thin red cord that They tie up pens with.
That went round old letters.
his undid old letters slowly, leering and laughing at his, before his began to turn them over, and threw old letters there.
I saw old letters fall."
"What's the matter with The cat?"
says " Mr. Guppy.
"Look at her!"
"Mad, I think.
And no wonder in this evil place."

What is it?
Hold up the light.
Here is a small burnt patch of flooring; here is the tinder from a little bundle of burnt paper, but not so light as usual, seeming to be steeped in something; and here is--is it the cinder of a small charred and broken log of wood sprinkled with white ashes, or is it coal?
Oh, horror, he IS here!
And this from which we run away, striking out the light and overturning one another into the street, is all that represents he.
Help, help, help!
Come into this house for heaven's sake!

The Lord Chancellor of the Lord Chancellor's Court, true to his title in his last act, has died the death of all lord chancellors in all courts and of all authorities in all places under all names soever, where false pretences are made, and where injustice is done.
Call the death by any name your Highness will, attribute the death to whom you will, or say the death might have been prevented how you will, the death is the same death eternally--inborn, inbred, engendered in the corrupted humours of the vicious body itself, and that only--spontaneous combustion, and none other of all the deaths that can be died.
