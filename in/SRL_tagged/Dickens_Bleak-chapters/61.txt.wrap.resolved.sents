A Wintry Day and Night Still impassive, as behoves its breeding, the Dedlock town house carries the Dedlock town house as usual towards the street of dismal grandeur.
There are powdered heads from time to time in the little windows of the hall, looking out at the untaxed powder falling all day from the sky; and in the same conservatory there is peach blossom turning the Dedlock town house exotically to the great hall fire from the nipping weather out of doors.
It is given out that my Lady has gone down into Lincolnshire, but is expected to return presently.
Rumour, busy overmuch, however, will not go down into Lincolnshire.
It persists in flitting and chattering about town.
It knows that that poor unfortunate man, Sir Leicester, has been sadly used.
It hears, my dear child, all sorts of shocking things.
It makes the world of five miles round quite merry.
Not to know that there is something wrong at the Dedlocks' is to augur yourself unknown.
One of the peachy-cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats is already apprised of all the principal circumstances that will come out before the Lords on Sir Leicester's application for a bill of divorce.
At Blaze and Sparkle's the jewellers and at Sheen and Gloss's the mercers, it is and will be for several hours the topic of the age, the feature of the century.
The patronesses of those establishments, albeit so loftily inscrutable, being as nicely weighed and measured there as any other article of the stock-in-trade, are perfectly understood in this new fashion by the rawest hand behind the counter.
"Our people, Mr. Jones," said Blaze and Sparkle to the rawest hand behind the counter in question on engaging him, "our people, sir, are sheep--mere sheep.
Where two or three marked ones go, all the rest follow.
Keep those two or three in your eye, Mr. Jones, and you have the flock."
So, likewise, Sheen and Gloss to THEIR Jones, in reference to knowing where to have the fashionable people and how to bring what the fashionable people (Sheen and Gloss) choose into fashion.
On similar unerring principles, Mr. Sladdery the librarian, and indeed the great farmer of gorgeous sheep, admits this very day, "Why yes, sir, there certainly ARE reports concerning Lady Dedlock, very current indeed among my high connexion, sir.
You see, my high connexion must talk about something, sir; and my high connexion's only to get a subject into vogue with one or two ladies I could name to make a subject go down with the whole.
Just what I should have done with those ladies, sir, in the case of any novelty you had left to me to bring in, those ladies have done of those ladies in the case of any novelty you had left to me to bring in through knowing Lady Dedlock and being perhaps a little innocently jealous of Lady Dedlock too, sir.
You'll find, sir, that this topic will be very popular among my high connexion.
If this topic will be very popular among my high connexion had been a speculation, sir, this topic will be very popular among my high connexion would have brought money.
And when I say so, you may trust to my being right, sir, for I have made it my business to study my high connexion and to be able to wind it up like a clock, sir."
Thus rumour thrives in the capital, and will not go down into Lincolnshire.
By half-past five, post meridian, Horse Guards' time, it has even elicited a new remark from the Honourable Mr. Stables, which bids fair to outshine the old one, on which he has so long rested he colloquial reputation.
This sparkling sally is to the effect that although he always knew she was the best-groomed woman in the stud, he had no idea she was a bolter.
It is immensely received in turf-circles.
At feasts and festivals also, in firmaments she has often graced, and among constellations she outshone but yesterday, she is still the prevalent subject.
What is it?
Who is it?
When was it?
Where was it?
How was it?
she is discussed by she dear friends with all the genteelest slang in vogue, with the last new word, the last new manner, the last new drawl, and the perfection of polite indifference.
A remarkable feature of the theme is that it is found to be so inspiring that several people come out upon it who never came out before--positively say things!
William Buffy carries one of these smartnesses from the place where William Buffy dines down to the House, where the Whip for William Buffy party hands his party about with William Buffy snuff-box to keep men together who want to be off, with such effect that the Speaker (who has had his party privately insinuated into the Speaker (who has had own ear under the corner of the Speaker (who has had wig) cries, "Order at the bar!"
three times without making an impression.
And not the least amazing circumstance connected with she being vaguely the town talk is that people hovering on the confines of Mr. Sladdery's high connexion, people who know nothing and ever did know nothing about she, think it essential to Mr. Sladdery's high connexion, people who know nothing and ever did know nothing about her reputation to pretend that she is Mr. Sladdery's high connexion, people who know nothing and ever did know nothing about her topic too, and to retail she at second- hand with the last new word and the last new manner, and the last new drawl, and the last new polite indifference, and all the rest of it, all at second-hand but considered equal to new in inferior systems and to fainter stars.
If there be any man of letters, art, or science among these little dealers, how noble in him to support the feeble sisters on such majestic crutches!
So goes the wintry day outside the Dedlock mansion.
How within it?
Sir Leicester, lying in Sir Leicester bed, can speak a little, though with difficulty and indistinctness.
Sir Leicester is enjoined to silence and to rest, and they have given Sir Leicester some opiate to lull Sir Leicester pain, for Sir Leicester old enemy is very hard with Sir Leicester.
Sir Leicester is never asleep, though sometimes Sir Leicester seems to fall into a dull waking doze.
Sir Leicester caused Sir Leicester bedstead to be moved out nearer to the window when Sir Leicester heard his bedstead was such inclement weather, and Sir Leicester head to be so adjusted that Sir Leicester could see the driving snow and sleet.
Sir Leicester watches his bedstead as his bedstead falls, throughout the whole wintry day.
Upon the least noise in the house, which is kept hushed, Sir Leicester hand is at the pencil.
The old housekeeper, sitting by Sir Leicester, knows what Sir Leicester would write and whispers, "No, Sir Leicester has not come back yet, Sir Leicester.
It was late last night when Sir Leicester went.
Sir Leicester has been but a little time gone yet."
Sir Leicester withdraws his hand and falls to looking at the sleet and snow again until they seem, by being long looked at, to fall so thick and fast that Sir Leicester is obliged to close Sir Leicester eyes for a minute on the giddy whirl of white flakes and icy blots.
Sir Leicester began to look at they as soon as it was light.
The day is not yet far spent when Sir Leicester conceives The day to be necessary that her rooms should be prepared for her.
It is very cold and wet.
Let there be good fires.
Let they know that her is expected.
Please see to it yourself.
Sir Leicester writes to this purpose on Sir Leicester slate, and Mrs. Rouncewell with a heavy heart obeys.
"For I dread, George," my Lady says to my Lady son, who waits below to keep my Lady company when my Lady has a little leisure, "I dread, my dear, that my Lady will never more set foot within these walls."
"That's a bad presentiment, mother."
"Nor yet within the walls of Chesney Wold, my dear."
"That's worse.
But why, mother?"
"When I saw my Lady my Lady yesterday, George, my Lady looked to my Lady--and I may say at my Lady too--as if the step on the Ghost's Walk had almost walked my Lady down."
"Come, come!
You alarm yourself with old-story fears, mother."
"No I don't, my dear.
No I don't.
It's going on for sixty year that I have been in this family, and I never had any fears for it before.
But it's breaking up, my dear; the great old Dedlock family is breaking up."
"I hope not, mother."
"I am thankful I have lived long enough to be with Sir Leicester in this illness and trouble, for I know I am not too old nor too useless to be a welcomer sight to Sir Leicester than anybody else in my place would be.
But the step on the Ghost's Walk the Ghost's Walk will walk my Lady my Lady down, George; it has been many a day behind my Lady, and now it will pass my Lady and go on."
"Well, mother dear, I say again, I hope not."
"Ah, so do I, George," the old lady returns, shaking mother dear head and parting mother dear folded hands.
"But if my fears come true, and he has to know it, who will tell he!"
"Are these my Lady rooms?"
"These are my Ladymy Lady's rooms, just as my Lady left These."
"Why, now," says the trooper, glancing round the trooper and speaking in a lower voice, "I begin to understand how you come to think as you do think, mother dear.
Rooms get an awful look about Rooms when Rooms are fitted up, like Rooms, for one person you are used to see in Rooms, and one person is away under any shadow, let alone being God knows where."
one person is not far out.
As all partings foreshadow the great final one, so, empty rooms, bereft of a familiar presence, mournfully whisper what your room and what mine must one day be.
my Lady's state has a hollow look, thus gloomy and abandoned; and in the inner apartment, where Mr. Bucket last night made Mr. Bucket secret perquisition, the traces of My Lady's state dresses and My Lady's state ornaments, even the mirrors accustomed to reflect her dresses and her ornaments when her dresses and her ornaments were a portion of My Lady's state, have a desolate and vacant air.
Dark and cold as the wintry day is, it is darker and colder in these deserted chambers than in many a hut that will barely exclude the weather; and though the servants heap fires in the grates and set the couches and the chairs within the warm glass screens that let her dresses and her ornaments ruddy light shoot through to the furthest corners, there is a heavy cloud upon the rooms which no light will dispel.
The old housekeeper and My Lady's state son remain until the preparations are complete, and then My Lady's state returns upstairs.
Volumnia has taken Mrs. Rouncewell's place in the meantime, though pearl necklaces and rouge pots, however calculated to embellish Bath, are but indifferent comforts to the invalid under present circumstances.
Volumnia, not being supposed to know (and indeed not knowing) what is the matter, has found Volumnia a ticklish task to offer appropriate observations and consequently has supplied it a ticklish task to offer appropriate observations place with distracting smoothings of the bed-linen, elaborate locomotion on tiptoe, vigilant peeping at My Lady's state kinsman's eyes, and one exasperating whisper to My Lady's state of, "He is asleep."
In disproof of which superfluous remark Sir Leicester has indignantly written on the slate, "I am not."
Yielding, therefore, the chair at the bedside to the quaint old housekeeper, Volumnia sits at a table a little removed, sympathetically sighing.
Sir Leicester watches the sleet and snow and listens for the returning steps that Sir Leicester expects.
In the ears of Sir Leicester old servant, looking as if My Lady's state had stepped out of an old picture-frame to attend a summoned Dedlock to another world, the silence is fraught with echoes of My Lady's state own words, "Who will tell Sir Leicester!"
Sir Leicester has been under Sir Leicester valet's hands this morning to be made presentable and is as well got up as the circumstances will allow.
Sir Leicester is propped with pillows, Sir Leicester grey hair is brushed in his grey hair usual manner, Sir Leicester linen is arranged to a nicety, and Sir Leicester is wrapped in a responsible dressing-gown.
Sir Leicester eye-glass and Sir Leicester watch are ready to Sir Leicester hand.
It is necessary--less to Sir Leicester own dignity now perhaps than for her sake--that Sir Leicester should be seen as little disturbed and as much Sir Leicester as may be.
Women will talk, and Volumnia, though a Dedlock, is no exceptional case.
Sir Leicester keeps her here, there is little doubt, to prevent her talking somewhere else.
Sir Leicester is very ill, but Sir Leicester makes Sir Leicester present stand against distress of mind and body most courageously.
The fair Volumnia, being one of those sprightly girls who cannot long continue silent without imminent peril of seizure by the dragon Boredom, soon indicates the approach of that monster with a series of undisguisable yawns.
Finding it impossible to suppress undisguisable yawns by any other process than conversation, her compliments Mrs. Rouncewell on her , declaring that her son positively is one of the finest figures her ever saw and as soldierly a looking person, her should think, as what's her son name, her favourite Life Guardsman --the man her dotes on, the dearest of creatures--who was killed at Waterloo.
Sir Leicester hears this tribute with so much surprise and stares about Sir Leicester in such a confused way that Mrs. Rouncewell feels it necessary to explain.
"Dedlock don't speak of my eldest son, Sir Leicester, but my youngest.
I have found my eldest son, Sir Leicester.
my eldest son, Sir Leicester has come home."
Sir Leicester breaks silence with a harsh cry.
"George?
her son come home, Mrs.
Rouncewell?"
The old housekeeper wipes The old housekeeper eyes.
"Thank God.
Yes, Sir Leicester."
Does this discovery of some one lost, this return of some one so long gone, come upon Sir Leicester as a strong confirmation of Sir Leicester hopes?
Does Sir Leicester think, "Shall I not, with the aid I have, recall The old housekeeper safely after this, there being fewer hours in The old housekeeper case than there are years in Sir Leicester?"
It is of no use entreating Sir Leicester; Sir Leicester is determined to speak now, and Sir Leicester does.
In a thick crowd of sounds, but still intelligibly enough to be understood.
"Why did you not tell me, Mrs.
Rouncewell?"
"It happened only yesterday, Sir Leicester, and I doubted your being well enough to be talked to of such things."
Besides, the giddy Volumnia now remembers with Mrs. Rouncewell little scream that nobody was to have known of Volumnia being Mrs. Rouncewell's son and that Mrs. Rouncewell was not to have told.
But Mrs. Rouncewell protests, with warmth enough to swell the stomacher, that of course Mrs. Rouncewell would have told Sir Leicester as soon as Sir Leicester got better.
"Where is your son George, Mrs.
Rouncewell?"
asks Sir Leicester, Mrs. Rouncewell, not a little alarmed by Sir Leicester disregard of the doctor's injunctions, replies, in London.
"Where in London?"
Mrs. Rouncewell is constrained to admit that Mrs. Rouncewell is in the house.
"Bring Mrs. Rouncewell here to my room.
Bring Mrs. Rouncewell directly."
my Lady can do nothing but go in search of Mrs. Rouncewell.
Sir Leicester, with such power of movement as Sir Leicester has, arranges Sir Leicester a little to receive Sir Leicester.
When Sir Leicester has done so, Sir Leicester looks out again at the falling sleet and snow and listens again for the returning steps.
A quantity of straw has been tumbled down in the street to deaden the noises there, and my Lady might be driven to the door perhaps without Sir Leicester hearing wheels.
Sir Leicester is lying thus, apparently forgetful of Sir Leicester newer and minor surprise, when the housekeeper returns, accompanied by my Lady trooper son.
George approaches softly to the bedside, makes George bow, squares George chest, and stands, with George face flushed, very heartily ashamed of George.
"Good heaven, and it is really George Rouncewell!"
exclaims Sir Leicester.
"Do you remember me, George?"
the trooper needs to look at George and to separate this sound from that sound before George knows what George has said, but doing this and being a little helped by George mother, George replies, "I must have a very bad memory, indeed, Sir Leicester, if I failed to remember you."
"When I look at you, George Rouncewell," Sir Leicester observes with difficulty, "I see something of a boy at Chesney Wold--I remember well--very well."
Sir Leicester looks at the trooper until tears come into her kinsman's eyes, and then Sir Leicester looks at the sleet and snow again.
"I ask your pardon, Sir Leicester," says the trooper, "but would you accept of my arms to raise you up?
You would lie easier, Sir Leicester, if you would allow me to move you."
"If you please, George Rouncewell; if you will be so good."
the trooper takes Sir Leicester in my arms like a child, lightly raises Sir Leicester, and turns Sir Leicester with Sir Leicester face more towards the window.
"Thank you.
You have your mother's gentleness," returns Sir Leicester, "and your own strength.
Thank you."
Sir Leicester signs to Sir Leicester with his hand not to go away.
George quietly remains at the bedside, waiting to be spoken to.
"Why did you wish for secrecy?"
It takes Sir Leicester some time to ask this.
"Truly I am not much to boast of, Sir Leicester, and I--I should still, Sir Leicester, if you was not so indisposed--which I hope you will not be long--I should still hope for the favour of being allowed to remain unknown in general.
That involves explanations not very hard to be guessed at, not very well timed here, and not very creditable to myself.
However opinions may differ on a variety of subjects, I should think it would be universally agreed, Sir Leicester, that I am not much to boast of."
"You have been a soldier," observes Sir Leicester, "and a faithful one."
George makes his bow.
"As far as that goes, Sir Leicester, I have done my duty under discipline, and it was the least I could do."
"You find me," says Sir Leicester, whose eyes are much attracted towards Sir Leicester, "far from well, George Rouncewell."
"I am very sorry both to hear it and to see it, Sir Leicester."
"I am sure you are.
No.
In addition to my older malady, I have had a sudden and bad attack.
Something that deadens," making an endeavour to pass one hand down one side, "and confuses," touching his lips.
George, with a look of assent and sympathy, makes another bow.
The different times when they were both young men (the trooper much the younger of the two) and looked at one another down at Chesney Wold arise before they and soften The different times when they were both young men (the trooper much the younger of the two) and looked at one another down at Chesney Wold.
Sir Leicester, evidently with a great determination to say, in Sir Leicester own manner, something that is on Sir Leicester mind before relapsing into silence, tries to raise Sir Leicester among Sir Leicester pillows a little more.
George, observant of the action, takes Sir Leicester in my arms again and places Sir Leicester as Sir Leicester desires to be.
"Thank you, George.
You are another self to George.
You have often carried my spare gun at Chesney Wold, George.
You are familiar to George in these strange circumstances, very familiar."
George has put Sir Leicester's sounder arm over George shoulder in lifting George up, and Sir Leicester is slow in drawing Sir Leicester's sounder arm away again as Sir Leicester says these words.
"I was about to add," Sir Leicester presently goes on, "I was about to add, respecting this attack, that this attack was unfortunately simultaneous with a slight misunderstanding between my Lady and George.
I do not mean that there was any difference between us (for there has been none), but that there was a misunderstanding of certain circumstances important only to us, which deprives me, for a little while, of my Lady's society.
my Lady has found it necessary to make a journey--I trust will shortly return.
Volumnia, do I make George intelligible?
The words are not quite under my command in the manner of pronouncing them."
Volumnia understands Volumnia perfectly, and in truth Volumnia delivers Volumnia with far greater plainness than could have been supposed possible a minute ago.
The effort by which Volumnia does so is written in the anxious and labouring expression of Volumnia face.
Nothing but the strength of Volumnia purpose enables Volumnia to make it.
"Therefore, Volumnia, I desire to say in your presence--and in the presence of my old retainer and friend, Mrs. Rouncewell, whose truth and fidelity no one can question, and in the presence of my Lady son George, who comes back like a familiar recollection of my youth in the home of my ancestors at Chesney Wold--in case I should relapse, in case I should not recover, in case I should lose both my speech and the power of writing, though I hope for better things--" The old housekeeper weeping silently; Volumnia in the greatest agitation, with the freshest bloom on her cheeks; the trooper with my arms folded and the trooper head a little bent, respectfully attentive.
"Therefore I desire to say, and to call you all to witness-- beginning, Volumnia, with yourself, most solemnly--that I am on unaltered terms with Dedlock.
That I assert no cause whatever of complaint against her.
That I have ever had the strongest affection for her, and that I retain it undiminished.
Say this to her, and to every one.
If you ever say less than this, you will be guilty of deliberate falsehood to me."
Volumnia tremblingly protests that her will observe Volumnia injunctions to the letter.
"my Lady is too high in position, too handsome, too accomplished, too superior in most respects to the best of those by whom my Lady is surrounded, not to have my Lady enemies and traducers, I dare say.
Let it be known to her enemies and traducers, as I make it known to you, that being of sound mind, memory, and understanding, I revoke no disposition I have made in my Lady favour.
I abridge nothing I have ever bestowed upon my Lady.
I am on unaltered terms with my Lady, and I recall--having the full power to do it if I were so disposed, as you see--no act I have done for my Lady advantage and happiness."
His formal array of words might have at any other time, as it has often had, something ludicrous in it, but at this time it is serious and affecting.
His noble earnestness, His fidelity, His gallant shielding of her, His generous conquest of His own wrong and His own pride for her sake, are simply honourable, manly, and true.
Nothing less worthy can be seen through the lustre of such qualities in the commonest mechanic, nothing less worthy can be seen in the best-born gentleman.
In such a light both aspire alike, both rise alike, both children of the dust shine equally.
Overpowered by his exertions, his lays his back on his and closes his for not more than a minute, when his again resumes his watching of the weather and his attention to the muffled sounds.
In the rendering of those little services, and in the manner of those little services acceptance, the trooper has become installed as necessary to his.
Nothing has been said, but it is quite understood.
his falls a step or two backward to be out of sight and mounts guard a little behind his 's chair.
The day is now beginning to decline.
The mist and the sleet into which the snow has all resolved the snow are darker, and the blaze begins to tell more vividly upon the room walls and furniture.
The gloom augments; the bright gas springs up in the streets; and the pertinacious oil lamps which yet hold their ground there, with their source of life half frozen and half thawed, twinkle gaspingly like fiery fish out of water--as their are.
The world, which has been rumbling over the straw and pulling at the bell, "to inquire," begins to go home, begins to dress, to dine, to discuss the bell dear friend with all the last new modes, as already mentioned.
Now does Sir Leicester become worse, restless, uneasy, and in great pain.
Volumnia, lighting a candle (with a predestined aptitude for doing something objectionable), is bidden to put it out again, for it is not yet dark enough.
Yet it is very dark too, as dark as it will be all night.
By and by she tries again.
No!
Put it out.
It is not dark enough yet.
His old housekeeper is the first to understand that His is striving to uphold the fiction with His that it is not growing late.
"Dear Sir Leicester, my honoured master," she softly whispers, "I must, for your own good, and my duty, take the freedom of begging and praying that you will not lie here in the lone darkness watching and waiting and dragging through the time.
Let me draw the curtains, and light the candles, and make things more comfortable about you.
The church-clocks will strike the hours just the same, Sir Leicester, and the night will pass away just the same.
my Lady will come back, just the same."
"I know it, Mrs. Rouncewell, but I am weak--and my Lady has been so long gone."
"Not so very long, Sir Leicester.
Not twenty-four hours yet."
"But that is a long time.
Oh, it is a long time!"
my Lady says it with a groan that wrings my Lady heart.
my Lady knows that this is not a period for bringing the rough light upon my Lady; my Lady thinks my Lady tears too sacred to be seen, even by my Lady.
Therefore my Lady sits in the darkness for a while without a word, then gently begins to move about, now stirring the fire, now standing at the dark window looking out.
Finally my Lady tells my Lady, with recovered self-command, "As you say, George Rouncewell, it is no worse for being confessed.
it is getting late, and they are not come.
Light the room!"
When it is lighted and the weather shut out, it is only left to my Lady to listen.
But they find that however dejected and ill my Lady is, my Lady brightens when a quiet pretence is made of looking at the fires in my Lady rooms and being sure that everything is ready to receive my Lady.
Poor pretence as it is, these allusions to my Lady being expected keep up hope within my Lady.
Midnight comes, and with it the same blank.
The carriages in the streets are few, and other late sounds in that neighbourhood there are none, unless a man so very nomadically drunk as to stray into the frigid zone goes brawling and bellowing along the pavement.
Upon this wintry night it is so still that listening to the intense silence is like looking at intense darkness.
If any distant sound be audible in this case, any distant sound be audible in this case departs through the gloom like a feeble light in that, and all is heavier than before.
The corporation of servants are dismissed to bed (not unwilling to go, for The corporation of servants were up all last night), and only Mrs. Rouncewell and George keep watch in Sir Leicester's room.
As the night lags tardily on--or rather when it seems to stop altogether, at between two and three o'clock--The corporation of servants find a restless craving on him to know more about the weather, now him cannot see it.
Hence George, patrolling regularly every half-hour to the rooms so carefully looked after, extends George march to the hall-door, looks about George, and brings back the best report George can make of the worst of nights, the sleet still falling and even the stone footways lying ankle- deep in icy sludge.
Volumnia, in Volumnia up a retired landing on the staircase--the second turning past the end of the carving and gilding, a cousinly room containing a fearful abortion of a portrait of Sir Leicester banished for a portrait of Sir Leicester crimes, and commanding in the day a solemn yard planted with dried-up shrubs like antediluvian specimens of black tea--is a prey to horrors of many kinds.
Not last nor least among a prey to horrors of many kinds, possibly, is a horror of what may befall Volumnia little income in the event, as Volumnia expresses it, "of anything happening" to Sir Leicester.
Anything, in this sense, meaning one thing only; and that the last thing that can happen to the consciousness of any baronet in the known world.
An effect of these horrors is that Volumnia finds Volumnia cannot go to bed in Volumnia own room or sit by the fire in her own room, but must come forth with Volumnia fair head tied up in a profusion of shawl, and Volumnia fair form enrobed in drapery, and parade the mansion like a ghost, particularly haunting the rooms, warm and luxurious, prepared for one who still does not return.
Solitude under such circumstances being not to be thought of, Volumnia is attended by Volumnia maid, who, impressed from Volumnia own bed for that purpose, extremely cold, very sleepy, and generally an injured maid as condemned by circumstances to take office with a cousin, when Volumnia had resolved to be maid to nothing less than ten thousand a year, has not a sweet expression of countenance.
The periodical visits of the trooper to these rooms, however, in the course of the trooper patrolling is an assurance of protection and company both to mistress and maid, which renders both very acceptable in the small hours of the night.
Whenever the trooper is heard advancing, they both make some little decorative preparation to receive the trooper; at other times they both divide they both watches into short scraps of oblivion and dialogues not wholly free from acerbity, as to whether Dedlock, sitting with her feet upon the fender, was or was not falling into the fire when rescued (to her great displeasure) by her guardian genius the maid.
"How is Sir Leicester now, George?"
inquires Volumnia, adjusting Volumnia cowl over Volumnia head.
"Why, Sir Leicester is much the same, miss.
Sir Leicester is very low and ill, and Sir Leicester even wanders a little sometimes."
"Has Sir Leicester asked for Sir Leicester?"
inquires Volumnia tenderly.
"Why, no, I can't say Sir Leicester has, miss.
Not within my hearing, that is to say."
"This is a truly sad time, George."
"It is indeed, miss.
Hadn't you better go to bed?"
"You had a deal better go to bed, Miss Dedlock," quoth the maid sharply.
But Volumnia answers No!
No!
She may be asked for, She may be wanted at a moment's notice.
She never should forgive She "if anything was to happen" and She was not on the spot.
She declines to enter on the question, mooted by the maid, how the spot comes to be there, and not in She room (which is nearer to Sir Leicester's), but staunchly declares that on the spot She will remain.
Volumnia further makes a merit of not having "closed an eye"--as if Volumnia had twenty or thirty--though it is hard to reconcile this statement with Volumnia having most indisputably opened two within five minutes.
But when it comes to four o'clock, and still the same blank, Volumnia's constancy begins to fail Volumnia, or rather it begins to strengthen, for Volumnia now considers that it is Volumnia duty to be ready for the morrow, when much may be expected of Volumnia, that, in fact, howsoever anxious to remain upon the spot, it may be required of Volumnia, as an act of self-devotion, to desert the spot.
So when the trooper reappears with the trooper, "Hadn't you better go to bed, miss?"
and when the maid protests, more sharply than before, "You had a deal better go to bed, Miss Dedlock!"
Volumnia meekly rises and says, "Do with Volumnia what you think best!"
George undoubtedly thinks it best to escort Volumnia on George arm to the door of Volumnia cousinly chamber, and the maid as undoubtedly thinks it best to hustle Volumnia into bed with mighty little ceremony.
Accordingly, these steps are taken; and now the trooper, in the trooper rounds, has the house to the trooper.
There is no improvement in the weather.
From the portico, from the eaves, from the parapet, from every ledge and post and pillar, drips the thawed snow.
It has crept, as if for shelter, into the lintels of the great door--under the lintels of the great door, into the corners of the windows, into every chink and crevice of retreat, and there wastes and dies.
It is falling still; upon the roof, upon the skylight, even through the skylight, and drip, drip, drip, with the regularity of the Ghost's Walk, on the stone floor below.
The trooper, his old recollections awakened by the solitary grandeur of a great house--no novelty to his once at Chesney Wold-- goes up the stairs and through the chief rooms, holding up his light at arm's length.
Thinking of his varied fortunes within the last few weeks, and of his rustic boyhood, and of the two periods of his life so strangely brought together across the wide intermediate space; thinking of the murdered man whose image is fresh in his mind; thinking of the lady who has disappeared from these very rooms and the tokens of whose recent presence are all here; thinking of the master of the house upstairs and of the foreboding, "Who will tell his!"
his looks here and looks there, and reflects how his MIGHT see something now, which it would tax his boldness to walk up to, lay his hand upon, and prove to be a fancy.
But it is all blank, blank as the darkness above and below, while his goes up the great staircase again, blank as the oppressive silence.
"All is still in readiness, George Rouncewell?"
"Quite orderly and right, Sir Leicester."
"No word of any kind?"
the trooper shakes the trooper head.
"No letter that can possibly have been overlooked?"
But the trooper knows there is no such hope as that and lays his head down without looking for an answer.
Very familiar to the trooper, as the trooper said the trooper some hours ago, George Rouncewell lifts the trooper into easier positions through the long remainder of the blank wintry night, and equally familiar with the trooper unexpressed wish, extinguishes his light and undraws the curtains at the first late break of day.
The day comes like a phantom.
Cold, colourless, and vague, The day sends a warning streak before The day of a deathlike hue, as if The day cried out, "Look what I am bringing you who watch there!
Who will tell the trooper!"
