A Turn of the Screw "Now, what," says Mr. George, "may this be?
Is it blank cartridge or ball?
A flash in the pan or a shot?"
An open letter is the subject of the trooper's speculations, and it seems to perplex the trooper mightily.
the trooper looks at it at arm's length, brings it close to the trooper, holds it in the trooper right hand, holds it in the trooper left hand, reads it with the trooper head on this side, with the trooper head on this side, contracts the trooper eyebrows, elevates his eyebrows, still cannot satisfy the trooper.
the trooper smooths it out upon the table with the trooper heavy palm, and thoughtfully walking up and down the gallery, makes a halt before it every now and then to come upon it with a fresh eye.
Even that won't do.
"Is it," Mr. George still muses, "blank cartridge or ball?"
Phil Squod, with the aid of a brush and paint-pot, is employed in the distance whitening the targets, softly whistling in quick-march time and in drum-and-fife manner that he must and will go back again to the girl he left behind he.
"Phil!"
The trooper beckons as he calls he.
Phil approaches in he usual way, sidling off at first as if he were going anywhere else and then bearing down upon he commander like a bayonet-charge.
Certain splashes of white show in high relief upon he dirty face, and he scrapes he one eyebrow with the handle of the brush.
"Attention, Phil!
Listen to this."
"Steady, commander, steady."
"'Sir.
Allow me to remind you (though there is no legal necessity for my doing so, as you are aware) that the bill at two months' date drawn on yourself by Mr. Matthew Bagnet, and by yourself accepted, for the sum of ninety-seven pounds four shillings and ninepence, will become due to-morrow, when you will please be prepared to take up the same on presentation.
Yours, Joshua Smallweed.'
What do you make of that, Phil?"
"Mischief, guv'ner."
"Why?"
"I think," replies Phil after pensively tracing out a cross-wrinkle in Phil forehead with the brush-handle, "that mischeevious consequences is always meant when money's asked for."
"Lookye, Phil," says the trooper, sitting on the table.
"First and last, I have paid, I may say, half as much again as this principal in interest and one thing and another."
Phil intimates by sidling back a pace or two, with a very unaccountable wrench of his wry face, that his does not regard the transaction as being made more promising by this incident.
"And lookye further, Phil," says the trooper, staying the trooper premature conclusions with a wave of the trooper hand.
"There has always been an understanding that this bill was to be what they call renewed.
And this bill has been renewed no end of times.
What do you say now?"
"I say that I think times is come to a end at last."
"You do?
Humph!
I am much of the same mind myself."
"Joshua Smallweed is Joshua Smallweed that was brought here in a chair?"
"The same."
"Guv'ner," says Phil with exceeding gravity, "he's a leech in he dispositions, he's a screw and a wice in he actions, a snake in he twistings, and a lobster in he claws."
Having thus expressively uttered he sentiments, Mr. Squod, after waiting a little to ascertain if any further remark be expected of Mr. Squod, gets back by Mr. Squod usual series of movements to the target Mr. Squod has in hand and vigorously signifies through Mr. Squod former musical medium that Mr. Squod must and Mr. Squod will return to that ideal young lady.
George, having folded the letter, walks in that direction.
"There IS a way, commander," says Phil, looking cunningly at George, "of settling this."
"Paying the money, I suppose?
I wish I could."
Phil shakes Phil head.
"No, guv'ner, no; not so bad as that.
There IS a way," says Phil with a highly artistic turn of Phil brush; "what I'm a-doing at present."
"Whitewashing."
Phil nods.
"A pretty way that would be!
Do you know what would become of the Bagnets in that case?
Do you know they would be ruined to pay off my old scores?
YOU'RE a moral character," says the trooper, eyeing the trooper in the trooper large way with no small indignation; "upon my life you are, Phil!"
Phil, on one knee at the target, is in course of protesting earnestly, though not without many allegorical scoops of the trooper brush and smoothings of the white surface round the rim with the trooper thumb, that the trooper had forgotten the Bagnet responsibility and would not so much as injure a hair of the head of any member of that worthy family when steps are audible in the long passage without, and a cheerful voice is heard to wonder whether George is at home.
Phil, with a look at George master, hobbles up, saying, "Here's the guv'ner, Mrs. Bagnet!
Here George is!"
and the old girl herself, accompanied by Mr. Bagnet, appears.
The old girl never appears in walking trim, in any season of the year, without a grey cloth cloak, coarse and much worn but very clean, which is, undoubtedly, the identical garment rendered so interesting to Bagnet by having made the identical garment way home to Europe from another quarter of the globe in company with Mrs. Bagnet and an umbrella.
The latter faithful appendage is also invariably a part of The old girl's presence out of doors.
It is of no colour known in this life and has a corrugated wooden crook for a handle, with a metallic object let into a metallic object prow, or beak, resembling a little model of a fanlight over a street door or one of the oval glasses out of a pair of spectacles, which ornamental object has not that tenacious capacity of sticking to a metallic object post that might be desired in an article long associated with the British army.
The old girl's umbrella is of a flabby habit of waist and seems to be in need of stays--an appearance that is possibly referable to The old girl's umbrella having served through a series of years at home as a cupboard and on journeys as a carpet bag.
The old girl never puts it up, having the greatest reliance on The old girl well-proved cloak with its capacious hood, but generally uses the instrument as a wand with which to point out joints of meat or bunches of greens in marketing or to arrest the attention of tradesmen by a friendly poke.
Without The old girl market- basket, which is a sort of wicker well with two flapping lids, The old girl never stirs abroad.
Attended by these The old girl trusty companions, therefore, The old girl honest sunburnt face looking cheerily out of a rough straw bonnet, Mrs. Bagnet now arrives, fresh-coloured and bright, in George's Shooting Gallery.
"Well, George, old fellow," says The old girl, "and how do YOU do, this sunshiny morning?"
Giving him a friendly shake of the hand, Mrs. Bagnet draws a long breath after Mrs. Bagnet walk and sits down to enjoy a rest.
Having a faculty, matured on the tops of baggage-waggons and in other such positions, of resting easily anywhere, Mrs. Bagnet perches on a rough bench, unties Mrs. Bagnet bonnet-strings, pushes back Mrs. Bagnet bonnet, crosses Mrs. Bagnet arms, and looks perfectly comfortable.
Mrs. Bagnet in the meantime has shaken hands with Mrs. Bagnet old comrade and with Phil, on whom Mrs. Bagnet likewise bestows a good-humoured nod and smile.
"Now, George," said Mrs. Bagnet briskly, "here we are, Lignum and myself"--she often speaks of Mrs. Bagnet husband by this appellation, on account, as it is supposed, of Lignum Vitae having been her husband old regimental nickname when they first became acquainted, in compliment to the extreme hardness and toughness of her husband physiognomy--"just looked in, we have, to make it all correct as usual about that security.
Give her husband the new bill to sign, George, and her husband'll sign it like a man."
"I was coming to you this morning," observes the trooper reluctantly.
"Yes, we thought you'd come to we this morning, but we turned out early and left Woolwich, the best of boys, to mind her husband sisters and came to you instead--as you see!
For Lignum, her husband's tied so close now, and gets so little exercise, that a walk does her husband good.
But what's the matter, George?"
asks Mrs. Bagnet, stopping in Mrs. Bagnet cheerful talk.
"You don't look you."
"I am not quite you," returns the trooper; "I have been a little put out, Mrs.
Bagnet."
Mrs. Bagnet bright quick eye catches the truth directly.
"George!"
holding up Mrs. Bagnet forefinger.
"Don't tell me there's anything wrong about that security of Lignum's!
Don't do it, George, on account of the children!"
the trooper looks at the trooper with a troubled visage.
"George," says Mrs. Bagnet, using both the trooper for emphasis and occasionally bringing down the trooper open hands upon the trooper knees.
"If you have allowed anything wrong to come to that security of Lignum's, and if you have let Lignum in for it, and if you have put us in danger of being sold up--and I see sold up in your face, George, as plain as print--you have done a shameful action and have deceived us cruelly.
I tell you, cruelly, George.
There!"
Mr. Bagnet, otherwise as immovable as a pump or a lamp-post, puts George large right hand on the top of George bald head as if to defend it from a shower-bath and looks with great uneasiness at Mrs. Bagnet.
"George," says that old girl, "I wonder at George!
George, I am ashamed of George!
George, I couldn't have believed you would have done it!
I always knew you to be a rolling stone that gathered no moss, but I never thought you would have taken away what little moss there was for Mrs. Bagnet and the children to lie upon.
You know what a hard-working, steady-going chap George is.
You know what Quebec and Malta and Woolwich are, and I never did think you would, or could, have had the heart to serve us so.
Oh, George!"
Mrs. Bagnet gathers up Mrs. Bagnet cloak to wipe Mrs. Bagnet eyes on in a very genuine manner, "How could you do it?"
Mrs. Bagnet ceasing, Bagnet removes Bagnet hand from his bald head as if the shower-bath were over and looks disconsolately at Mr. George, who has turned quite white and looks distressfully at the grey cloak and straw bonnet.
"Mat," says the trooper in a subdued voice, addressing Mat but still looking at Mat wife, "I am sorry you take it so much to heart, because I do hope it's not so bad as that comes to.
I certainly have, this morning, received this letter"--which letter"--which reads aloud--"but I hope it may be set right yet.
As to a rolling stone, why, what you say is true.
I AM a rolling stone, and I never rolled in anybody's way, I fully believe, that I rolled the least good to.
But it's impossible for an old vagabond comrade to like your wife and family better than I like 'em, Mat, and I trust you'll look upon Mat as forgivingly as you can.
Don't think I've kept anything from 'em.
I haven't had the letter more than a quarter of an hour."
"Old girl," murmurs Bagnet after a short silence, "will you tell Bagnet my opinion?"
"Oh!
Why didn't Bagnet marry," Mrs. Bagnet answers, half laughing and half crying, "Joe Pouch's widder in North America?
Then Bagnet wouldn't have got Bagnet into these troubles."
"The old girl," says Bagnet, "puts it correct--why didn't you?"
"Well, The old girl has a better husband by this time, I hope," returns the trooper.
"Anyhow, here I stand, this present day, NOT married to Joe Pouch's widder.
What shall I do?
You see all I have got about me.
It's not mine; it's all I have got about me.
Give the word, and I'll sell off every morsel.
If I could have hoped the word would have brought in nearly the sum wanted, I'd have sold all long ago.
Don't believe that I'll leave you or yours in the lurch, Mat.
I'd sell me first.
I only wish," says the trooper, giving me a disparaging blow in the chest, "that I knew of any one who'd buy such a second-hand piece of old stores."
"Old girl," murmurs Bagnet, "give Bagnet another bit of my mind."
GeorgeGeorge," says The old girl, "you are not so much to be blamed, on full consideration, except for ever taking this business without the means."
"And that was like me!"
observes the trooper, shaking his bald head.
"Like me, I know."
"Silence!
The old girl," says Bagnet, "is correct--in The old girl way of giving my opinions--hear me out!"
"That was when you never ought to have asked for the security, George, and when you never ought to have got the security, George, all things considered.
But what's done can't be undone.
You are always an honourable and straightforward fellow, as far as lays in your power, though a little flighty.
On the other hand, you can't admit but what it's natural in us to be anxious with such a thing hanging over us heads.
So forget and forgive all round, George.
Come!
Forget and forgive all round!"
Mrs. Bagnet, giving George one of Mrs. Bagnet honest hands and giving her husband the other, George gives each of them one of George and holds them while George speaks.
"I do assure you them, there's nothing I wouldn't do to discharge this obligation.
But whatever I have been able to scrape together has gone every two months in keeping it up.
us have lived plainly enough here, Phil and I.
But George's Shooting Gallery don't quite do what was expected of George's Shooting Gallery, and George's Shooting Gallery's not--in short, it's not the mint.
It was wrong in George to take It?
Well, so It was.
But I was in a manner drawn into that step, and I thought that step might steady me, and set me up, and you'll try to overlook my having such expectations, and upon my soul, I am very much obliged to you, and very much ashamed of George."
With these concluding words, George gives a shake to each of the hands George holds, and relinquishing each of the hands he holds, backs a pace or two in a broad-chested, upright attitude, as if George had made a final confession and were immediately going to be shot with all military honours.
"George, hear me out!"
says Mr. Bagnet, glancing at his wife.
"Old girl, go on!"
Bagnet, being in this singular manner heard out, has merely to observe that the letter must be attended to without any delay, that the letter is advisable that George and George should immediately wait on Mr. Smallweed in person, and that the primary object is to save and hold harmless Mr. Bagnet, who had none of the money.
George, entirely assenting, puts on George hat and prepares to march with Mrs. Bagnet to the enemy's camp.
"Don't you mind a woman's hasty word, George," says Mrs. Bagnet, patting Mrs. Bagnet on the shoulder.
"I trust Lignum to you, and I am sure you'll bring Lignum through Lignum."
the trooper returns that this is kindly said and that the trooper WILL bring Lignum through Lignum somehow.
Upon which Mrs. Bagnet, with Mrs. Bagnet cloak, basket, and umbrella, goes home, bright-eyed again, to the rest of Mrs. Bagnet family, and the comrades sally forth on the hopeful errand of mollifying Mr. Smallweed.
Whether there are two people in England less likely to come satisfactorily out of any negotiation with Mr. Smallweed than Mr. George and Mrs. Bagnet may be very reasonably questioned.
Also, notwithstanding Mr. George and Mr. Matthew Bagnet martial appearance, broad square shoulders, and heavy tread, whether there are within the same limits two more simple and unaccustomed children in all the Smallweedy affairs of life.
As they proceed with great gravity through the streets towards the region of Mount Pleasant, Mr. Bagnet, observing his companion to be thoughtful, considers it a friendly part to refer to Mrs. Bagnet's late sally.
"George, you know the old girl--the old girl's as sweet and as mild as milk.
But touch the old girl on the children--or myself--and the old girl's off like gunpowder."
"It does the old girl credit, Mat!"
GeorgeGeorge," says Mrs. Bagnet, looking straight before Mrs. Bagnet, "the old girl--can't do anything--that don't do "the old girl .
More or less.
I never say so.
Discipline must Discipline maintained."
""the old girl's worth "the old girl weight in gold," says the trooper.
"In gold?"
says Mrs. Bagnet.
"I'll tell you what.
the old girl's weight--is twelve stone six.
Would I take The old girl's weight----in any metal--for the old girl?
No.
Why not?
Because the old girl's metal is far more precious--than the preciousest metal.
And the old girl's the preciousest metal!"
"You are right, Mat!"
"When the old girl took me--and accepted of the ring--the old girl 'listed under me and the children--heart and head, for life.
the old girl's that earnest," says Mrs. Bagnet, "and true to the old girl colours--that, touch us with a finger--and the old girl turns out--and stands to the old girl arms.
If the old girl fires wide--once in a way--at the call of duty--look over it, George.
For the old girl's loyal!"
"Why, bless the old girl, Mat," returns the trooper, "I think the higher of the old girl for the trooper!"
"You are right!"
says Mrs. Bagnet, though without relaxing the rigidity of a single muscle.
"Think as high of the old girl--as the rock of Gibraltar--and still you'll be thinking low--of such merits.
But I never own to the rock of Gibraltar before the old girl.
Discipline must be maintained."
These encomiums bring These encomiums to Mount Pleasant and to Grandfather Smallweed's house.
The door is opened by the perennial Judy, who, having surveyed These encomiums from top to toe with no particular favour, but indeed with a malignant sneer, leaves These encomiums standing there while the old girl consults the oracle as to These encomiums admission.
the oracle may be inferred to give consent from the circumstance of the old girl returning with the words on the old girl honey lips that they can come in if they want to the oracle.
Thus privileged, they come in and find Mr. Smallweed with Mr. Smallweed feet in the drawer of Mr. Smallweed chair as if his feet in the drawer of his chair were a paper foot-bath and Grandfather Smallweed's obscured with the cushion like a bird that is not to sing.
"My dear friend," says Grandfather Smallweed's with those two lean affectionate arms of Grandfather Smallweed's stretched forth.
"How de do?
How de do?
Who is our friend, my dear friend?"
"Why this," returns George, not able to be very conciliatory at first, "is Matthew Bagnet, who has obliged me in that matter of our, you know."
"Oh!
Mr. Bagnet?
Surely!"
Mr. Smallweed looks at Mr. Smallweed under Mr. Smallweed hand.
"Hope you're well, Mrs. Bagnet?
Fine man, Mr. George!
Military air, sir!"
No chairs being offered, George brings one forward for Mrs. Bagnet and one for George.
They sit down, Mrs. Bagnet as if Mrs. Bagnet had no power of bending Mrs. Bagnet, except at the hips, for that purpose.
"Judy," says Mr. Smallweed, "bring the pipe."
"Why, I don't know,George interposes, "that the young woman need give the young woman that trouble, for to tell you the truth, I am not inclined to smoke it to-day."
"Ain't you?"
returns Mr. Smallweed.
"Judy, bring the pipe."
"The fact is, Mr. Smallweed," proceeds George, "that I find Mr. Smallweed in rather an unpleasant state of mind.
It appears to Mr. Smallweed, sir, that your friend in the city has been playing tricks."
"Oh, dear no!"
says Grandfather Smallweed's.
"Grandfather Smallweed's never does that!"
"Don't Grandfather Smallweed's?
Well, I am glad to hear it, because I thought it might be Grandfather Smallweed's doing.
This, you know, I am speaking of.
This letter."
Grandfather Smallweed's smiles in a very ugly way in recognition of This letter.
"What does it mean?"
asks George.
"Judy," says Mr. Smallweed.
"Have you got the pipe?
Give the pipe to Mr. Smallweed.
Did you say what does the pipe mean, my good friend?"
"Aye!
Now, come, come, you know, Grandfather Smallweed's," urges the trooper, constraining Grandfather Smallweed's to speak as smoothly and confidentially as Grandfather Smallweed's can, holding This letter in one hand and resting the broad knuckles of the other on Grandfather Smallweed's thigh, "a good lot of money has passed between us, and us are face to face at the present moment, and are both well aware of the understanding there has always been.
I am prepared to do the usual thing which I have done regularly and to keep this matter going.
I never got a letter like this from you before, and I have been a little put about by a letter like this this morning, because here's my friend Matthew Bagnet, who, you know, had none of the money--" "I DON'T know it, you know," says Mr. Smallweed quietly.
"Why, con-found you--it, I mean--I tell you so, don't I?"
"Oh, yes, you tell me so," returns Grandfather Smallweed's.
"But I don't know it."
"Well!"
says the trooper, swallowing the trooper fire.
"I know it."
Mr. Smallweed replies with excellent temper, "Ah!
That's quite another thing!"
And adds, "But it don't matter.
Mrs. Bagnet's situation is all one, whether or no."
George George makes a great effort to arrange the affair comfortably and to propitiate Grandfather Smallweed's by taking George upon George own terms.
"That's just what I mean.
As you say, Mr. Smallweed, here's Matthew Bagnet liable to be fixed whether or no.
Now, you see, that makes Matthew Bagnet good lady very uneasy in his good lady mind, and me too, for whereas I'm a harum-scarum sort of a good-for-nought that more kicks than halfpence come natural to, why Matthew Bagnet's a steady family man, don't you see?
Now, Mr. Smallweed," says the trooper, gaining confidence as the trooper proceeds in the trooper soldierly mode of doing business, "although you and I are good friends enough in a certain sort of a way, I am well aware that I can't ask you to let my friend Bagnet off entirely."
"Oh, dear, you are too modest.
You can ASK me anything, Mr.
George."
(There is an ogreish kind of jocularity in Grandfather Smallweed's to-day.)
"And you can refuse, you mean, eh?
Or not you so much, perhaps, as your friend in the citythe city?
Ha ha ha!"
"Ha ha ha!"
echoes Grandfather Smallweed's.
In such a very hard manner and with eyes so particularly green that Mrs. Bagnet's natural gravity is much deepened by the contemplation of that venerable man.
"Come!"
says the sanguine George.
"I am glad to find we can be pleasant, because I want to arrange this pleasantly.
Here's my friend Bagnet, and here am I. we'll settle the matter on the spot, if you please, Mr. Smallweed, in the usual way.
And you'll ease my friend Bagnet's mind, and his family's mind, a good deal if you'll just mention to his what we understanding is."
Here some shrill spectre cries out in a mocking manner, "Oh, good gracious!
Oh!"
Unless, indeed, it be the sportive Judy, who is found to be silent when the startled visitors look round, but whose chin has received a recent toss, expressive of derision and contempt.
Mrs. Bagnet's gravity becomes yet more profound.
"But I think you asked me, Mr. George"--old Smallweed, who all this time has had the pipe in Mrs. Bagnet hand, is the speaker now--"I think you asked me, what did This letter mean?"
"Why, yes, I did," returns the trooper in Mrs. Bagnet off-hand way, "but I don't care to know particularly, if it's all correct and pleasant."
Mr. Smallweed, purposely balking himself in an aim at the trooper's head, throws the pipe on the ground and breaks the pipe to pieces.
"That's what it means, my dear friend.
I'll smash you.
I'll crumble you.
I'll powder you.
Go to the devil!"
The two friends rise and look at one another.
Mr. Bagnet's gravity has now attained its profoundest point.
"Go to the devil!"
repeats the old man.
"I'll have no more of your pipe-smokings and swaggerings.
What?
You're an independent dragoon, too!
Go to my lawyer (you remember where; you have been there before) and show your independence now, will you?
Come, My dear friend, there's a chance for My dear friend.
Open the street door, Judy; put these blusterers out!
Call in help if help don't go.
Put 'em out!"
He vociferates this so loudly that Mr. Bagnet, laying He hands on the shoulders of He comrade before the latter can recover from He amazement, gets He on the outside of the street door, which is instantly slammed by the triumphant Judy.
Utterly confounded, George awhile stands looking at the knocker.
Mrs. Bagnet, in a perfect abyss of gravity, walks up and down before the little parlour window like a sentry and looks in every time Mrs. Bagnet passes, apparently revolving something in Mrs. Bagnet mind.
"Come, Mat," says George when George has recovered George, "we must try my lawyer.
Now, what do you think of this rascal?"
Mrs. Bagnet, stopping to take a farewell look into the parlour, replies with one shake of Mrs. Bagnet head directed at the interior, "If the old girl had been here--the old girl have told Mrs.
Bagnet!"
Having so discharged Mrs. Bagnet of the subject of Mrs. Bagnet cogitations, Mrs. Bagnet falls into step and marches off with the trooper, shoulder to shoulder.
When they present they in Lincoln's Inn Fields, Mr. Tulkinghorn is engaged and not to be seen.
Mr. Tulkinghorn is not at all willing to see they, for when they have waited a full hour, and the clerk, on Mr. Tulkinghorn bell being rung, takes the opportunity of mentioning as much, Mr. Tulkinghorn brings forth no more encouraging message than that Mr. Tulkinghorn has nothing to say to they and they had better not wait.
they do wait, however, with the perseverance of military tactics, and at last the bell rings again and the client in possession comes out of Mr. Tulkinghorn's room.
the client in possession is a handsome old lady, no other than Mrs. Rouncewell, housekeeper at Chesney Wold.
Chesney Wold comes out of the sanctuary with a fair old-fashioned curtsy and softly shuts the door.
Chesney Wold is treated with some distinction there, for the clerk steps out of the clerk pew to show Chesney Wold through the outer office and to let Chesney Wold out.
Chesney Wold is thanking the clerk for the clerk attention when Chesney Wold observes the comrades in waiting.
"I beg your pardon, sir, but I think those gentlemen are military?"
the clerk referring the question to those gentlemen with the clerk eye, and George not turning round from the almanac over the fire-place.
Mrs. Bagnet takes upon Mrs. Bagnet to reply, "Yes, ma'am.
Formerly."
"I thought so.
I was sure of it.
My heart warms, gentlemen, at the sight of you.
it always does at the sight of such.
God bless you, gentlemen!
You'll excuse an old woman, but I had a son once who went for a soldier.
A fine handsome youth a son once who went for a soldier was, and good in a son once who went for a soldier bold way, though some people did disparage a son once who went for a soldier to a son once who went for a soldier poor mother.
I ask your pardon for troubling you, sir.
God bless you, gentlemen!"
"Same to you, ma'am!"
returns Mrs. Bagnet with right good will.
There is something very touching in the earnestness of Chesney Wold's voice and in the tremble that goes through Chesney Wold quaint old figure.
But George is so occupied with the almanac over the fire-place the fire-place (calculating the coming months by it perhaps) that George does not look round until Chesney Wold has gone away and the door is closed upon Chesney Wold.
"George," Mr. Bagnet gruffly whispers when he does turn from the almanac at last.
"Don't be cast down!
'Why, soldiers, why--should we be melancholy, boys?'
Cheer up, my hearty!"
the clerk having now again gone in to say that they are still there and Mr. Tulkinghorn being heard to return with some irascibility, "Let 'em come in then!"
they pass into the great room with the painted ceiling and find the clerk standing before his fire.
"Now, you men, what do you want?
Sergeant, I told you the last time I saw you that I don't desire your company here."
Sergeant replies--dashed within the last few minutes as to Sergeant usual manner of speech, and even as to Sergeant usual carriage--that Sergeant has received This letter, has been to Mr. Smallweed about This letter, and has been referred there.
"I have nothing to say to you," rejoins Mr. Tulkinghorn.
"If you get into debt, you must pay your debts or take the consequences.
You have no occasion to come here to learn that, I suppose?"
Sergeant is sorry to say that Sergeant is not prepared with the money.
"Very well!
Then the other man--this man, if this is the other man--this man--must pay this is he for you."
Sergeant is sorry to add that the other man is not prepared with the money either.
"Very well!
Then you must pay it between you or you must both be sued for it and both suffer.
You have had the money and must refund the money.
You are not to pocket other people's pounds, shillings, and pence and escape scot-free."
The lawyer sits down in The lawyer easy-chair and stirs his fire.
George hopes George will have the goodness to-- "I tell you, sergeant, I have nothing to say to you.
I don't like your associates and don't want you here.
This matter is not at all in my course of practice and is not in the outer office.
Mr. Smallweed is good enough to offer these affairs to George, but these affairs are not in my way.
You must go to Melchisedech's in Clifford's Inn."
"I must make an apology to you, sir," says George, "for pressing George upon you with so little encouragement--which is almost as unpleasant to George as it can be to you--but would you let me say a private word to you?"
Mr. Tulkinghorn rises with Mr. Tulkinghorn hands in Mr. Tulkinghorn pockets and walks into one of the window recesses.
"Now!
I have no time to waste."
In the midst of Mr. Tulkinghorn perfect assumption of indifference, Mr. Tulkinghorn directs a sharp look at the trooper, taking care to stand with Mr. Tulkinghorn own back to the light and to have the other with Mr. Tulkinghorn face towards it.
"Well, sir," says George, "this man with George is the other party implicated in this unfortunate affair--nominally, only nominally-- and my sole object is to prevent Mr. Tulkinghorn getting into trouble on my account.
Mr. Tulkinghorn is a most respectable man with a wife and family, formerly in the Royal Artillery--" "My dear friend, I don't care a pinch of snuff for the whole Royal Artillery establishment--officers, men, tumbrils, waggons, horses, guns, and ammunition."
"'Tis likely, sir.
But I care a good deal for Mrs. Bagnet and Mrs. Bagnet wife and family being injured on my account.
And if I could bring his wife and family through this matter, I should have no help for this matter but to give up without any other consideration what you wanted of George the other day."
"Have you got it here?"
"I have got it here, sir."
"Sergeant," the lawyer proceeds in the lawyer dry passionless manner, far more hopeless in the dealing with than any amount of vehemence, "make up your mind while I speak to you, for this is final.
After I have finished speaking I have closed the subject, and I won't re- open the subject.
Understand that.
You can leave here, for a few days, what you say you have brought here if you choose; you can take the subject away at once if you choose.
In case you choose to leave the subject here, I can do this for you--I can replace this matter on this matter old footing, and I can go so far besides as to give you a written undertaking that this man Bagnet shall never be troubled in any way until you have been proceeded against to the utmost, that your means shall be exhausted before the creditor looks to this man Bagnet.
This is in fact all but freeing this man Bagnet.
Have you decided?"
the trooper puts the trooper hand into the trooper breast and answers with a long breath, "I must do his breast, sir."
So Mr. Tulkinghorn, putting on Mr. Tulkinghorn spectacles, sits down and writes the undertaking, which Mr. Tulkinghorn slowly reads and explains to Bagnet, who has all this time been staring at the ceiling and who puts his hand on Mr. Tulkinghorn bald head again, under this new verbal shower-bath, and seems exceedingly in need of the old girl through whom to express Mr. Tulkinghorn sentiments.
the trooper then takes from the trooper breast-pocket a folded paper, which the trooper lays with an unwilling hand at the lawyer's elbow.
"'Tis only a letter of instructions, sir.
The last I ever had from the trooper."
Look at a millstone, Mr. George, for some change in its expression, and you will find its quite as soon as in the face of Mr. Tulkinghorn when Mr. Tulkinghorn opens and reads the letter!
Mr. Tulkinghorn refolds it and lays it in Mr. Tulkinghorn desk with a countenance as unperturbable as death.
Nor has Mr. Tulkinghorn anything more to say or do but to nod once in the same frigid and discourteous manner and to say briefly, "You can go.
Show these men out, there!"
Being shown out, these men repair to Mrs. Bagnet's residence to dine.
Boiled beef and greens constitute the day's variety on the former repast of boiled pork and greens, and Mrs. Bagnet serves out the meal in the same way and seasons it with the best of temper, being that rare sort of old girl that old girl receives Good to old girl arms without a hint that her arms might be Better and catches light from any little spot of darkness near old girl.
The spot on this occasion is the darkened brow of George; George is unusually thoughtful and depressed.
At first Mrs. Bagnet trusts to the combined endearments of Quebec and Malta to restore George, but finding those young ladies sensible that those young ladies existing Bluffy is not the Bluffy of those young ladies usual frolicsome acquaintance, Mrs. Bagnet winks off the light infantry and leaves George to deploy at leisure on the open ground of the domestic hearth.
But George does not.
George remains in close order, clouded and depressed.
During the lengthy cleaning up and pattening process, when George and Mrs. Bagnet are supplied with he and Mr. Bagnet pipes, George is no better than George was at dinner.
George forgets to smoke, looks at the fire and ponders, lets George pipe out, fills the breast of Mrs. Bagnet with perturbation and dismay by showing that George has no enjoyment of tobacco.
Therefore when Mrs. Bagnet at last appears, rosy from the invigorating pail, and sits down to Mrs. Bagnet work, Mrs. Bagnet growls, "Old girl!"
and winks monitions to Mrs. Bagnet to find out what's the matter.
"Why, George!"
says Mrs. Bagnet, quietly threading Mrs. Bagnet needle.
"How low you are!"
"Am I?
Not good company?
Well, I am afraid I am not."
"George ain't at all like Bluffy, mother!"
cries Malta.
"Because George ain't well, I think, mother," adds Quebec.
"Sure that's a bad sign not to be like Bluffy, too!"
returns the trooper, kissing the young damsels.
"But it's true," with a sigh, "true, I am afraid.
These little ones are always right!"
GeorgeGeorge," says Mrs. Bagnet, working busily, "if I thought you cross enough to think of anything that a shrill old soldier's wife--who could have bitten her tongue off afterwards and ought to have done it almost--said this morning, I don't know what I shouldn't say to you now."
"My kind soul of a darling," returns the trooper.
"Not a morsel of it."
"Because really and truly, George, what I said and meant to say was that I trusted Lignum to you and was sure you'd bring Lignum through Lignum.
And you HAVE brought Lignum through Lignum, noble!"
"Thankee, my dear!"
says George.
"I am glad of your good opinion."
In giving Mrs. Bagnet's hand, with Mrs. Bagnet work in it, a friendly shake--for Mrs. Bagnet took Mrs. Bagnet seat beside Lignum--the trooper's attention is attracted to Mrs. Bagnet face.
After looking at it for a little while as Mrs. Bagnet plies Mrs. Bagnet needle, Lignum looks to young Woolwich, sitting on Lignum stool in the corner, and beckons that fifer to Lignum.
"See there, my boy," says George, very gently smoothing the mother's hair with George hand, "there's a good loving forehead for you!
All bright with love of you, my boy.
A little touched by the sun and the weather through following your father about and taking care of you, but as fresh and wholesome as a ripe apple on a tree."
her face expresses, so far as in her face wooden material lies, the highest approbation and acquiescence.
"The time will come, my boy," pursues the trooper, "when this hair of your mother's will be grey, and this forehead all crossed and re-crossed with wrinkles, and a fine old lady she'll be then.
Take care, while you are young, that you can think in those days, 'I never whitened a hair of she dear head--I never marked a sorrowful line in she face!'
For of all the many things that you can think of when you are a man, you had better have THAT by you, young Woolwich!George concludes by rising from George chair, seating my boy beside George mother in it, and saying, with something of a hurry about George, that George'll smoke George pipe in the street a bit.
