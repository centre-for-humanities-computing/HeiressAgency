Signs and Tokens I don't know how it is I seem to be always writing about Tokens. I mean all the time to write about other people, and I try to think about Tokens as little as possible, and I am sure, when I find Tokens coming into the story again, I am really vexed and say, "Dear, dear, you tiresome little creature, I wish you wouldn't!" but it is all of no use. I hope any one who may read what I write will understand that if these pages contain a great deal about Tokens, I can only suppose it must be because I have really something to do with these pages and can't be kept out. My darling and I read together, and worked, and practised, and found so much employment for our time that the winter days flew by our like bright-winged birds. Generally in the afternoons, and always in the evenings, Richard gave our Richard company. Although Richard was one of the most restless creatures in the world, Richard certainly was very fond of our society. Richard was very, very, very fond of Ada. I mean it, and I had better say it at once. I had never seen any young people falling in love before, but I found any young people out quite soon. I could not say so, of course, or show that I knew anything about it. On the contrary, I was so demure and used to seem so unconscious that sometimes I considered within Richard while I was sitting at work whether I was not growing quite deceitful. But there was no help for it. All I had to do was to be quiet, and I was as quiet as a mouse. All I had to do were as quiet as mice too, so far as any words were concerned, but the innocent manner in which All I had to do relied more and more upon Richard as All I had to do took more and more to one another was so charming that I had great difficulty in not showing how it interested me. "Our dear little old woman is such a capital old woman," Richard would say, coming up to meet me in the garden early, with Richard pleasant laugh and perhaps the least tinge of a blush, "that I can't get on without Our dear little old woman. Before I begin my harum-scarum day-- grinding away at those books and instruments and then galloping up hill and down dale, all the country round, like a highwayman--it does me so much good to come and have a steady walk with Our comfortable friend, that here I am again!" "You know, Dame Durden, dear," Ada would say at night, with Ada head upon my shoulder and the firelight shining in Ada thoughtful eyes, "I don't want to talk when Our come upstairs here. Only to sit a little while thinking, with your dear face for company, and to hear the wind and remember the poor sailors at sea--" Ah! Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor. Our had talked it over very often now, and there was some talk of gratifying the inclination of Richard childhood for the sea. Mr. Jarndyce had written to a relation of the family, a great Sir Leicester Dedlock, for Mr. Jarndyce interest in Richard's favour, generally; and Sir Leicester had replied in a gracious manner that Sir Leicester would be happy to advance the prospects of the young gentleman if it should ever prove to be within Sir Leicester power, which was not at all probable, and that my Lady sent my Lady compliments to the young gentleman (to whom my Lady perfectly remembered that my Lady was allied by remote consanguinity) and trusted that Mr. Jarndyce would ever do Mr. Jarndyce duty in any honourable profession to which Mr. Jarndyce might devote Mr. Jarndyce. "So I apprehend it's pretty clear," said Richard to Richard, "that I shall have to work my own way. Never mind! Plenty of people have had to do that before now, and have done it. I only wish I had the command of a clipping privateer to begin with and could carry off the Chancellor and keep the Chancellor on short allowance until the Chancellor gave judgment in our cause. the Chancellor'd find the Chancellor growing thin, if the Chancellor didn't look sharp!" With a buoyancy and hopefulness and a gaiety that hardly ever flagged, Richard had a carelessness in Richard character that quite perplexed me, principally because Richard mistook it, in such a very odd way, for prudence. it entered into all Richard calculations about money in a singular manner which I don't think I can better explain than by reverting for a moment to our loan to Mr. Skimpole. Mr. Jarndyce had ascertained the amount, either from Mr. Skimpole himself or from Coavinses, and had placed the money in my hands with instructions to Mr. Jarndyce to retain my own part of the money and hand the rest to Richard. The number of little acts of thoughtless expenditure which Richard justified by the recovery of Richard ten pounds, and the number of times Richard talked to Mr. Jarndyce as if Richard had saved or realized that amount, would form a sum in simple addition. "My prudent Mother Hubbard, why not?" My prudent Mother Hubbard said to Mr. Jarndyce when My prudent Mother Hubbard wanted, without the least consideration, to bestow five pounds on the brickmaker. "I made ten pounds, clear, out of Coavinses' business." "How was that?" said I. "Why, I got rid of ten pounds which I was quite content to get rid of and never expected to see any more. You don't deny that?" "No," said I. "Very well! Then I came into possession of ten pounds--" "The same ten pounds," I hinted. "That has nothing to do with it!" returned Richard. "I have got ten pounds more than I expected to have, and consequently I can afford to spend ten pounds without being particular." In exactly the same way, when he was persuaded out of the sacrifice of ten pounds by being convinced that it would do no good, he carried that sum to he credit and drew upon that sum. "Let me see!" he would say. "I saved five pounds out of the brickmaker's affair, so if I have a good rattle to London and back in a post-chaise and put that down at four pounds, I shall have saved one. And it's a very good thing to save one, let me tell you: a penny saved is a penny got!" I believe Richard's was as frank and generous a nature as there possibly can be. Richard was ardent and brave, and in the midst of all Richard wild restlessness, was so gentle that I knew Richard like a brother in a few weeks. Richard gentleness was natural to Richard and would have shown itself abundantly even without Ada's influence; but with itself, Richard became one of the most winning of companions, always so ready to be interested and always so happy, sanguine, and light-hearted. I am sure that I, sitting with them, and walking with them, and talking with them, and noticing from day to day how them went on, falling deeper and deeper in love, and saying nothing about it, and each shyly thinking that love was the greatest of secrets, perhaps not yet suspected even by the other--I am sure that I was scarcely less enchanted than them were and scarcely less pleased with the pretty dream. We were going on in this way, when one morning at breakfast Mr. Jarndyce received a letter, and looking at the superscription, said, "From Boythorn? Aye, aye!" and opened and read a letter with evident pleasure, announcing to We in a parenthesis when Mr. Jarndyce was about half-way through, that Boythorn was "coming down" on a visit. Now who was Boythorn, We thought. And I dare say We thought too--I am sure I did, for one--would Boythorn at all interfere with what was going forward? "I went to school with this fellow, Lawrence Boythorn," said Mr. Jarndyce, tapping a letter as Mr. Jarndyce laid a letter on the table, "more than five and forty years ago. Mr. Jarndyce was then the most impetuous boy in the world, and Mr. Jarndyce is now the most impetuous man. Mr. Jarndyce was then the loudest boy in the world, and Mr. Jarndyce is now the most impetuous man. Mr. Jarndyce was then the heartiest and sturdiest boy in the world, and Mr. Jarndyce is now the heartiest and sturdiest man. Mr. Jarndyce is a tremendous fellow." "In stature, sir?" asked Richard. "Pretty well, Mr. Jarndyce, in that respect," said Mr. Jarndyce; "being some ten years older than I and a couple of inches taller, with Mr. Jarndyce head thrown back like an old soldier, Mr. Jarndyce stalwart chest squared, Mr. Jarndyce hands like a clean blacksmith's, and Mr. Jarndyce lungs! There's no simile for his lungs. Talking, laughing, or snoring, they make the beams of the house shake." As Mr. Jarndyce sat enjoying the image of Mr. Jarndyce friend Boythorn, we observed the favourable omen that there was not the least indication of any change in the wind. "But it's the inside of the man, the warm heart of the man, the passion of the man, the fresh blood of the man, Mr. Jarndyce--and Ada, and little Cobweb too, for you are all interested in a visitor--that I speak of," the man pursued. "the man language is as sounding as the man voice. the man is always in extremes, perpetually in the superlative degree. In the man condemnation the man is all ferocity. You might suppose the man to be an ogre from what the man says, and I believe the man has the reputation of one with some people. There! I tell you no more of the man beforehand. You must not be surprised to see the man take me under the man protection, for the man has never forgotten that I was a low boy at school and that our friendship began in the man knocking two of my head tyrant's teeth out (the man says six) before breakfast. Boythorn and the man man," to me, "will be here this afternoon, my dear." I took care that the necessary preparations were made for Mr. Boythorn's reception, and our looked forward to Mr. Boythorn arrival with some curiosity. this afternoon wore away, however, and Mr. Boythorn did not appear. The dinner-hour arrived, and still Mr. Boythorn did not appear. The dinner was put back an hour, and our were sitting round the fire with no light but the blaze when the hall-door suddenly burst open and the hall resounded with these words, uttered with the greatest vehemence and in a stentorian tone: "We have been misdirected, Jarndyce, by a most abandoned ruffian, who told our to take the turning to the right instead of to the left. He is the most intolerable scoundrel on the face of the earth. He father must have been a most consummate villain, ever to have such a son. I would have had that fellow shot without the least remorse!" "Did His father do it on purpose?" Mr. Jarndyce inquired. "I have not the slightest doubt that the scoundrel has passed the scoundrel whole existence in misdirecting travellers!" returned the other. "By my soul, I thought the scoundrel the worst-looking dog I had ever beheld when the scoundrel was telling me to take the turning to the right. And yet I stood before that fellow face to face and didn't knock the scoundrel brains out!" "Teeth, you mean?" said Mr. Jarndyce. "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Mr. Boythorn, really making the whole house vibrate. "What, you have not forgotten it yet! Ha, ha, ha! And that was another most consummate vagabond! By my soul, the countenance of that fellow when that fellow was a boy was the blackest image of perfidy, cowardice, and cruelty ever set up as a scarecrow in a field of scoundrels. If I were to meet that most unparalleled despot in the streets to-morrow, I would fell that fellow like a rotten tree!" "I have no doubt of a rotten tree," said Mr. Jarndyce. "Now, will you come upstairs?" "By my soul, Mr. Jarndyce," returned Mr. Jarndyce guest, who seemed to refer to Mr. Jarndyce watch, "if you had been married, I would have turned back at the garden-gate and gone away to the remotest summits of the Himalaya Mountains sooner than I would have presented Mr. Jarndyce at this unseasonable hour." "Not quite so far, I hope?" said Mr. Jarndyce. "By my life and honour, yes!" cried the visitor. "I wouldn't be guilty of the audacious insolence of keeping a lady of the house waiting all this time for any earthly consideration. I would infinitely rather destroy Mr. Jarndyce--infinitely rather!" Talking thus, they went upstairs, and presently we heard Mr. Jarndyce in Mr. Jarndyce bedroom thundering "Ha, ha, ha!" and again "Ha, ha, ha!" until the flattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion and to laugh as enjoyingly as Mr. Jarndyce did or as we did when we heard Mr. Jarndyce laugh. we conceived a prepossession in Mr. Jarndyce favour, for there was a sterling quality in this laugh, and in Mr. Jarndyce vigorous, healthy voice, and in the roundness and fullness with which Mr. Jarndyce uttered every word Mr. Jarndyce spoke, and in the very fury of Mr. Jarndyce superlatives, which seemed to go off like blank cannons and hurt nothing. But we were hardly prepared to have it so confirmed by Mr. Jarndyce appearance when Mr. Jarndyce presented Mr. Jarndyce. Mr. Jarndyce was not only a very handsome old gentleman--upright and stalwart as Mr. Jarndyce had been described to us-- with a massive grey head, a fine composure of face when silent, a figure that might have become corpulent but for Mr. Jarndyce being so continually in earnest that Mr. Jarndyce gave it no rest, and a chin that might have subsided into a double chin but for the vehement emphasis in which it was constantly required to assist; but Mr. Jarndyce was such a true gentleman in Mr. Jarndyce manner, so chivalrously polite, Mr. Jarndyce face was lighted by a smile of so much sweetness and tenderness, and it seemed so plain that Mr. Jarndyce had nothing to hide, but showed Mr. Jarndyce exactly as Mr. Jarndyce was--incapable, as Richard said, of anything on a limited scale, and firing away with those blank great guns because Mr. Jarndyce carried no small arms whatever--that really I could not help looking at Mr. Jarndyce with equal pleasure as Mr. Jarndyce sat at dinner, whether Mr. Jarndyce smilingly conversed with Ada and me, or was led by Mr. Jarndyce into some great volley of superlatives, or threw up Mr. Jarndyce head like a bloodhound and gave out that tremendous "Ha, ha, ha!" "You have brought your bird with you, I suppose?" said Mr. Jarndyce. "By heaven, Mr. Jarndyce is your bird!" replied the other. "Mr. Jarndyce IS the most wonderful creature! I wouldn't take ten thousand guineas for your bird. I have left an annuity for Mr. Jarndyce sole support in case Mr. Jarndyce should outlive me. Mr. Jarndyce is, in sense and attachment, a phenomenon. And His father was one of the most astonishing birds that ever lived!" The subject of this laudation was a very little canary, who was so tame that Mr. Jarndyce was brought down by Mr. Boythorn's man, on Mr. Jarndyce forefinger, and after taking a gentle flight round the room, alighted on Mr. Jarndyce master's head. To hear Mr. Boythorn presently expressing the most implacable and passionate sentiments, with this fragile mite of a creature quietly perched on Mr. Boythorn forehead, was to have a good illustration of Mr. Boythorn character, I thought. "By my soul, Jarndyce," Mr. Boythorn said, very gently holding up a bit of bread to the canary to peck at, "if I were in your place I would seize every master in Chancery by the throat to-morrow morning and shake -morrow until -morrow money rolled out of -morrow pockets and -morrow bones rattled in -morrow skin. I would have a settlement out of somebody, by fair means or by foul. If you would empower me to do it, I would do it for you would empower me to do it with the greatest satisfaction!" (All this time the canary was eating out of -morrow hand.) "I thank you, Lawrence, but the suit is hardly at such a point at present," returned Mr. Jarndyce, laughing, "that it would be greatly advanced even by the legal process of shaking the bench and the whole bar." "There never was such an infernal cauldron as that Chancery on the face of the earth!" said Mr. Boythorn. "Nothing but a mine below it on a busy day in term time, with all it records, rules, and precedents collected in it and every functionary belonging to it also, high and low, upward and downward, from it son the Accountant-General to it father the Devil, and the whole blown to atoms with ten thousand hundredweight of gunpowder, would reform it in the least!" It was impossible not to laugh at the energetic gravity with which he recommended this strong measure of reform. When we laughed, he threw up he and shook he broad chest, and again the whole country seemed to echo to he "Ha, ha, ha!" It had not the least effect in disturbing the bird, whose sense of security was complete and who hopped about the table with It quick head now on this side and now on that, turning It bright sudden eye on It master as if he were no more than another bird. "But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of way?" said Mr. Jarndyce. "You are not free from the toils of the law yourself!" "that fellow has brought actions against ME for trespass, and I have brought actions against HIM for trespass," returned Mr. Boythorn. "By heaven, HIM is the proudest fellow breathing. It is morally impossible that HIM name can be Sir Leicester. It must be Sir Lucifer." "Complimentary to our distant relation!" said my guardian laughingly to Ada and Richard. "I would beg Miss Clare's pardon and Mr. Carstone's pardon," resumed our visitor, "if I were not reassured by seeing in the fair face of the lady and the smile of the gentleman that it is quite unnecessary and that they keep they distant relation at a comfortable distance." "Or he keeps us," suggested Richard. "By my soul," exclaimed Mr. Boythorn, suddenly firing another volley, "that fellow is, and His father was, and Mr. Boythorn grandfather was, the most stiff-necked, arrogant imbecile, pig-headed numskull, ever, by some inexplicable mistake of Nature, born in any station of life but a walking-stick's! The whole of that family are the most solemnly conceited and consummate blockheads! But it's no matter; he should not shut up my path if he were fifty baronets melted into one and living in a hundred Chesney Wolds, one within another, like the ivory balls in a Chinese carving. that fellow, by that fellow agent, or secretary, or somebody, writes to that fellow 'Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, presents that fellow compliments to Mr. Boythorn, and has to call Mr. Boythorn attention to the fact that the green pathway by the old parsonage-house, now the property of Mr. Boythorn, is Sir Leicester's right of way, being in fact a portion of the park of chesney Wold, and that Sir Leicester finds it convenient to close up the same.' I write to that fellow, 'Mr. Boythorn presents Mr. Boythorn compliments to Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and has to call his attention to the fact that Mr. Boythorn totally denies the whole of Sir Leicester Dedlock's positions on every possible subject and has to add, in reference to closing up the pathway, that Mr. Boythorn will be glad to see the man who may undertake to do it.' that fellow sends a most abandoned villain with one eye to construct a gateway. I play upon that execrable scoundrel with a fire-engine until the breath is nearly driven out of that fellow body. that fellow erects a gate in the night. I chop a fire-engine down and burn a fire-engine in the morning. that fellow sends that fellow myrmidons to come over the fence and pass and repass. I catch them in humane man traps, fire split peas at them legs, play upon them with a fire-engine--resolve to free mankind from the insupportable burden of the existence of those lurking ruffians. that fellow brings actions for trespass; I bring actions for trespass. that fellow brings actions for assault and battery; I defend them and continue to assault and batter. Ha, ha, ha!" To hear that fellow say all this with unimaginable energy, one might have thought that fellow the angriest of mankind. To see that fellow at the very same time, looking at another bird now perched upon that fellow thumb and softly smoothing another bird feathers with that fellow forefinger, one might have thought that fellow the gentlest. To hear that fellow laugh and see the broad good nature of that fellow face then, one might have supposed that that fellow had not a care in the world, or a dispute, or a dislike, but that that fellow whole existence was a summer joke. "No, no," that fellow said, "no closing up of my paths by any Dedlock! Though I willingly confess," here that fellow softened in a moment, "that Dedlock is the most accomplished lady in the world, to whom I would do any homage that a plain gentleman, and no baronet with a head seven hundred years thick, may. A man who joined his regiment at twenty and within a week challenged the most imperious and presumptuous coxcomb of a commanding officer that ever drew the breath of life through a tight waist--and got broke for the breath of life--is not the man to be walked over by all the Sir Lucifers, dead or alive, locked or unlocked. Ha, ha, ha!" "Nor the man to allow his junior to be walked over either?" said my guardian. "Most assuredly not!" said Mr. Boythorn, clapping Mr. Boythorn on the shoulder with an air of protection that had something serious in it, though Mr. Boythorn laughed. "Mr. Boythorn will stand by the low boy, always. Jarndyce, you may rely upon Mr. Boythorn! But speaking of this trespass-- with apologies to Miss Clare and Miss Summerson for the length at which I have pursued so dry a subject--is there nothing for me from your men Kenge and Carboy?" "I think not, Esther?" said Mr. Jarndyce. "Nothing, guardian." "Much obliged!" said Mr. Boythorn. "Had no need to ask, after even my slight experience of Miss Summerson's forethought for every one about her." (They all encouraged me; They all were determined to do it.) "I inquired because, coming from Lincolnshire, I of course have not yet been in town, and I thought some letters might have been sent down here. I dare say some letters will report progress to- morrow morning." I saw him so often in the course of the evening, which passed very pleasantly, contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a satisfaction that made him fine face remarkably agreeable as him sat at a little distance from the piano listening to the music--and him had small occasion to tell us that him was passionately fond of music, for him face showed it--that I asked my guardian as us sat at the backgammon board whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married. "No," said him. "No." "But him meant to be!" said I. "How did you find out that?" him returned with a smile. "Why, guardian," I explained, not without reddening a little at hazarding what was in my thoughts, "there is something so tender in him manner, after all, and him is so very courtly and gentle to us, and --" Mr. Jarndyce directed him eyes to where him was sitting as I have just described him. I said no more. "You are right, little woman," him answered. "him was all but married once. Long ago. And once." "Did the lady die?" "No--but the lady died to him. That time has had That time influence on all him later life. Would you suppose him to have a head and a heart full of romance yet?" "I think, guardian, I might have supposed so. But it is easy to say that when you have told me so." "him has never since been what him might have been," said Mr. Jarndyce, "and now you see him in him age with no one near him but him servant and him little yellow friend. It's your throw, my dear!" I felt, from my guardian's manner, that beyond this point I could not pursue the subject without changing the wind. I therefore forbore to ask any further questions. I was interested, but not curious. I thought a little while about this old love story in the night, when I was awakened by Mr. Boythorn's lusty snoring; and I tried to do that very difficult thing, imagine old people young again and invested with the graces of youth. But I fell asleep before I had succeeded, and dreamed of the days when I lived in my godmother's house. I am not sufficiently acquainted with such subjects to know whether it is at all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my life. With the morning there came a letter from Messrs. Kenge and Carboy to Mr. Boythorn informing Mr. Boythorn that one of their clerks would wait upon Mr. Boythorn at noon. As it was the day of the week on which I paid the bills, and added up my books, and made all the household affairs as compact as possible, I remained at home while Mr. Jarndyce, Ada, and Richard took advantage of a very fine day to make a little excursion, Mr. Boythorn was to wait for Kenge and Carboy's clerk and then was to go on foot to meet Kenge and Carboy's clerk on Kenge and Carboy's clerk return. Well! I was full of business, examining tradesmen's books, adding up columns, paying money, filing receipts, and I dare say making a great bustle about it when Mr. Guppy was announced and shown in. I had had some idea that the clerk who was to be sent down might be the young gentleman who had met me at the coach-office, and I was glad to see the clerk who was to be sent down, because the clerk who was to be sent down was associated with my present happiness. I scarcely knew the clerk who was to be sent down again, the clerk who was to be sent down was so uncommonly smart. the clerk who was to be sent down had an entirely new suit of glossy clothes on, a shining hat, lilac-kid gloves, a neckerchief of a variety of colours, a large hot-house flower in the clerk who was to be sent down button-hole, and a thick gold ring on the clerk who was to be sent down little finger. Besides which, the clerk who was to be sent down quite scented the dining-room with bear's-grease and other perfumery. the clerk who was to be sent down looked at the clerk who was to be sent down with an attention that quite confused me when I begged the clerk who was to be sent down to take a seat until the servant should return; and as the clerk who was to be sent down sat there crossing and uncrossing the clerk who was to be sent down legs in a corner, and I asked the clerk who was to be sent down if the clerk who was to be sent down had had a pleasant ride, and hoped that Kenge was well, I never looked at Kenge, but I found Kenge looking at the clerk who was to be sent down in the same scrutinizing and curious way. When the request was brought to Kenge that Kenge would go upstairs to Mr. Boythorn's room, I mentioned that Kenge would find lunch prepared for Kenge when Kenge came down, of which Mr. Jarndyce hoped Mr. Jarndyce would partake. Mr. Jarndyce said with some embarrassment, holding the handle of the door, "Shall I have the honour of finding you here, miss?" I replied yes, I should be there; and Mr. Jarndyce went out with a bow and another look. I thought Mr. Jarndyce only awkward and shy, for Mr. Jarndyce was evidently much embarrassed; and I fancied that the best thing I could do would be to wait until I saw that Mr. Jarndyce had everything Mr. Jarndyce wanted and then to leave Mr. Jarndyce to Mr. Jarndyce. The lunch was soon brought, but The lunch remained for some time on the table. The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a long one, and a stormy one too, I should think, for although Mr. Boythorn room was at some distance I heard Mr. Boythorn loud voice rising every now and then like a high wind, and evidently blowing perfect broadsides of denunciation. At Mr. Guppy came back, looking something the worse for the conference. "My eye, miss," Mr. Boythorn said in a low voice, "Mr. Boythorn's a Tartar!" "Pray take some refreshment, sir," said Mr. Guppy sat down at the table and began nervously sharpening the carving-knife on the carving-fork, still looking at Mr. Guppy (as I felt quite sure without looking at Mr. Guppy) in the same unusual manner. The sharpening lasted so long that at last I felt a kind of obligation on Mr. Guppy to raise my eyes in order that I might break the spell under which Mr. Guppy seemed to labour, of not being able to leave off. Mr. Guppy immediately looked at the dish and began to carve. "What will you take yourself, miss? You'll take a morsel of something?" "No, thank you," said I. "Shan't I give you a piece of anything at all, miss?" said Mr. Guppy, hurriedly drinking off a glass of wine. "Nothing, thank you," said I. Mr.I have only waited to see that you have everything you want. Is there anything I can order for you?" "No, I am much obliged to you, miss, I'm sure. I've everything that I can require to make me comfortable--at least I--not comfortable-- I'm never that." Mr. Guppy drank off two more glasses of wine, one after another. I thought I had better go. "I beg your pardon, miss!" said Mr. Guppy, rising when Mr. Guppy saw me rise. "But would you allow me the favour of a minute's private conversation?" Not knowing what to say, I sat down again. "What follows is without prejudice, miss?" said Mr. Guppy, anxiously bringing a chair towards the table. "I don't understand what you mean," said I, wondering. "It's one of our law terms, miss. You won't make any use of It to my detriment at Kenge and Carboy's or elsewhere. If our conversation shouldn't lead to anything, I am to be as I was and am not to be prejudiced in my situation or worldly prospects. In short, it's in total confidence." "I am at a loss, sir," said I, "to imagine what you can have to communicate in total confidence to me, whom you have never seen but once; but I should be very sorry to do you any injury." "Thank you, miss. I'm sure of it--that's quite sufficient." All this time Mr. Guppy was either planing Mr. Guppy forehead with Mr. Guppy handkerchief or tightly rubbing the palm of Mr. Guppy left hand with the palm of Mr. Guppy right. "If you would excuse my taking another glass of wine, miss, I think it might assist me in getting on without a continual choke that cannot fail to be mutually unpleasant." Mr. Guppy did so, and came back again. I took the opportunity of moving well behind the table. "You wouldn't allow me to offer you one, would you miss?" said Mr. Guppy, apparently refreshed. "Not any," said I. "Not half a glass?" said Mr. Guppy. "Quarter? No! Then, to proceed. My present salary, Miss Summerson, at Kenge and Carboy's, is two pound a week. When I first had the happiness of looking upon you, it was one fifteen, and had stood at that figure for a lengthened period. A rise of five has since taken place, and a further rise of five is guaranteed at the expiration of a term not exceeding twelve months from the present date. My mother has a little property, which takes the form of a small life annuity, upon which My mother lives in an independent though unassuming manner in the Old Street Road. My mother is eminently calculated for a mother-in-law. My mother never interferes, is all for peace, and My mother disposition easy. My mother has My mother failings--as who has not?--but I never knew My mother do it when company was present, at which time you may freely trust My mother with wines, spirits, or malt liquors. My own abode is lodgings at Penton Place, Pentonville. My own abode is lowly, but airy, open at the back, and considered one of the 'ealthiest outlets. Miss Summerson! In the mildest language, I adore you. Would you be so kind as to allow me (as I may say) to file a declaration--to make an offer!" Mr. Guppy went down on Mr. Guppy knees. I was well behind my table and not much frightened. I said, "Get up from that ridiculous position immediately, sir, or you will oblige me to break my implied promise and ring the bell!" "Hear me out, miss!" said Mr. Guppy, folding Mr. Guppy hands. "I cannot consent to hear another word, sir," I returned, "Unless you get up from the carpet directly and go and sit down at the table as you ought to do if you have any sense at all." Mr. Guppy looked piteously, but slowly rose and did so. "Yet what a mockery what a mockery is, miss," Mr. Guppy said with Mr. Guppy hand upon Mr. Guppy heart and shaking Mr. Guppy head at Mr. Guppy in a melancholy manner over the tray, "to be stationed behind food at such a moment. The soul recoils from food at such a moment, miss." "I beg you to conclude," said I; "you have asked me to hear you out, and I beg you to conclude." "I will, miss," said Mr. Guppy. "As I love and honour, so likewise I obey. Would that I could make thee the subject of that vow before the shrine!" "That is quite impossible," said I, "and entirely out of the question." "I am aware," said Mr. Guppy, leaning forward over the tray and regarding me, as I again strangely felt, though my eyes were not directed to Mr. Guppy, with Mr. Guppy late intent look, "I am aware that in a worldly point of view, according to all appearances, my offer is a poor one. But, Miss Summerson! Angel! No, don't ring--I have been brought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of general practice. Though a young man, I have ferreted out evidence, got up cases, and seen lots of life. Blest with your hand, what means might I not find of advancing your interests and pushing your fortunes! What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you? I know nothing now, certainly; but what MIGHT I not if I had your confidence, and you set me on?" I told a young man that a young man addressed my interest or what a young man supposed to be my interest quite as unsuccessfully as a young man addressed my inclination, and a young man would now understand that I requested a young man, if a young man pleased, to go away immediately. "Cruel miss," said Mr. Guppy, "hear but another word! I think you must have seen that I was struck with those charms on the day when I waited at the Whytorseller. I think you must have remarked that I could not forbear a tribute to those charms when I put up the steps of the 'ackney-coach. It was a feeble tribute to thee, but It was well meant. Thy image has ever since been fixed in my breast. I have walked up and down of an evening opposite Jellyby's house only to look upon the bricks that once contained thee. This out of to- day, quite an unnecessary out so far as the attendance, which was its pretended object, went, was planned by me alone for thee alone. If I speak of interest, it is only to recommend me and my respectful wretchedness. Love was before Love, and is before Love." "I should be pained, Mr. Guppy," said I, rising and putting my hand upon the bell-rope, "to do you or any one who was sincere the injustice of slighting any honest feeling, however disagreeably expressed. If you have really meant to give me a proof of your good opinion, though ill-timed and misplaced, I feel that I ought to thank you. I have very little reason to be proud, and I am not proud. I hope," I think I added, without very well knowing what I said, "that you will now go away as if you had never been so exceedingly foolish and attend to Messrs. Kenge and Carboy's business." "Half a minute, miss!" cried Mr. Guppy, checking me as I was about to ring. "This has been without prejudice?" "I will never mention This," said I, "unless you should give me future occasion to do so." "A quarter of a minute, miss! In case you should think better at any time, however distant--THAT'S no consequence, for my feelings can never alter--of anything I have said, particularly what might I not do, Mr. William Guppy, eighty-seven, Penton Place, or if removed, or dead (of blighted hopes or anything of that sort), care of Mrs. Guppy, three hundred and two, Old Street Road, will be sufficient." I rang the bell, the servant came, and Mr. Guppy, laying the servant written card upon the table and making a dejected bow, departed. Raising my eyes as the servant went out, I once more saw the servant looking at the servant after the servant had passed the door. I sat there for another hour or more, finishing my books and payments and getting through plenty of business. Then I arranged my desk, and put everything away, and was so composed and cheerful that I thought I had quite dismissed this unexpected incident. But, when I went upstairs to my own room, I surprised the servant by beginning to laugh about it and then surprised the servant still more by beginning to cry about it. In short, I was in a flutter for a little while and felt as if an old chord had been more coarsely touched than an old chord ever had been since the days of the dear old doll, long buried in the garden.
