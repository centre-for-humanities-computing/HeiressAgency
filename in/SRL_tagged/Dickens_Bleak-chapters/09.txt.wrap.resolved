Covering a Multitude of Sins It was interesting when I dressed before daylight to peep out of window, where my candles were reflected in the black panes like two beacons, and finding all beyond still enshrouded in the indistinctness of last night, to watch how it turned out when the day came on. As the prospect gradually revealed the prospect and disclosed the scene over which the wind had wandered in the dark, like my memory over my life, I had a pleasure in discovering the unknown objects that had been around me in my sleep. At first they were faintly discernible in the mist, and above they the later stars still glimmered. That pale interval over, the picture began to enlarge and fill up so fast that at every new peep I could have found enough to look at for an hour. Imperceptibly my candles became the only incongruous part of the morning, the dark places in my room all melted away, and the day shone bright upon a cheerful landscape, prominent in which the old Abbey Church, with its massive tower, threw a softer train of shadow on the view than seemed compatible with its rugged character. But so from rough outsides (I hope I have learnt), serene and gentle influences often proceed. Every part of the house was in such order, and every one was so attentive to me, that I had no trouble with my two bunches of keys, though what with trying to remember the contents of each little store-room drawer and cupboard; and what with making notes on a slate about jams, and pickles, and preserves, and bottles, and glass, and china, and a great many other things; and what with being generally a methodical, old-maidish sort of foolish little person, I was so busy that I could not believe it was breakfast- time when I heard the bell ring. Away I ran, however, and made tea, as I had already been installed into the responsibility of the tea-pot; and then, as they were all rather late and nobody was down yet, I thought I would take a peep at the garden and get some knowledge of that too. I found it quite a delightful place--in front, the pretty avenue and drive by which we had approached (and where, by the by, we had cut up the gravel so terribly with we wheels that I asked the gardener to roll it); at the back, the flower-garden, with my darling at the gardener window up there, throwing it open to smile out at me, as if the gardener would have kissed me from that distance. Beyond the garden was a kitchen-garden, and then a paddock, and then a snug little rick-yard, and then a dear little farm-yard. As to the house itself, with the house itself three peaks in the roof; the house itself various-shaped windows, some so large, some so small, and all so pretty; the house itself trellis-work, against the southfront for roses and honey-suckle, and the house itself homely, comfortable, welcoming look--the house itself was, as Ada said when Ada came out to meet me with Ada arm through that of the house itself master, worthy of Ada cousin John, a bold thing to say, though he only pinched Ada dear cheek for it. Mr. Skimpole was as agreeable at breakfast as Mr. Skimpole had been overnight. There was honey on the table, and honey on the table led Mr. Skimpole into a discourse about bees. Mr. Skimpole had no objection to honey, Mr. Skimpole said (and I should think Mr. Skimpole had not, for Mr. Skimpole seemed to like it), but Mr. Skimpole protested against the overweening assumptions of bees. Mr. Skimpole didn't at all see why the busy bee should be proposed as a model to Mr. Skimpole; Mr. Skimpole supposed the busy bee liked to make honey, or Mr. Skimpole wouldn't do it-- nobody asked Mr. Skimpole. It was not necessary for the busy bee to make such a merit of Mr. Skimpole tastes. If every confectioner went buzzing about the world banging against everything that came in Mr. Skimpole way and egotistically calling upon everybody to take notice that Mr. Skimpole was going to Mr. Skimpole work and must not be interrupted, the world would be quite an unsupportable place. Then, after all, it was a ridiculous position to be smoked out of your fortune with brimstone as soon as you had made it. You would have a very mean opinion of a Manchester man if a Manchester man spun cotton for no other purpose. a Manchester man must say a Manchester man thought a drone the embodiment of a pleasanter and wiser idea. a drone said unaffectedly, "You will excuse me; I really cannot attend to the shop! I find a Manchester man in a world in which there is so much to see and so short a time to see a drone in that I must take the liberty of looking about a Manchester man and begging to be provided for by somebody who doesn't want to look about a Manchester man." This appeared to Mr. Skimpole to be the drone philosophy, and Mr. Skimpole thought This a very good philosophy, always supposing a drone to be willing to be on good terms with the bee, which, so far as Mr. Skimpole knew, the easy fellow always was, if the consequential creature would only let the easy fellow, and not be so conceited about the easy fellow honey! Mr. Skimpole pursued this fancy with the lightest foot over a variety of ground and made us all merry, though again Mr. Skimpole seemed to have as serious a meaning in what Mr. Skimpole said as Mr. Skimpole was capable of having. I left them still listening to Mr. Skimpole when I withdrew to attend to my new duties. them had occupied me for some time, and I was passing through the passages on my return with my basket of keys on my arm when Mr. Jarndyce called me into a small room next Mr. Jarndyce bed-chamber, which I found to be in part a little library of books and papers and in part quite a little museum of Mr. Jarndyce boots and shoes and hat- boxes. "Sit down, my dear," said Mr. Jarndyce. "This, you must know, is the growlery. When I am out of humour, I come and growl here." "You must be here very seldom, sir," said I. "Oh, you don't know me!" he returned. "When I am deceived or disappointed in--the wind, and the wind's easterly, I take refuge here. the growlery is the best-used room in the house. You are not aware of half my humours yet. my dear, how you are trembling!" I could not help it; I tried very hard, but being alone with that benevolent presence, and meeting he kind eyes, and feeling so happy and so honoured there, and my heart so full-- I kissed he hand. I don't know what I said, or even that I spoke. he was disconcerted and walked to the window; I almost believed with an intention of jumping out, until he turned and I was reassured by seeing in he eyes what he had gone there to hide. he gently patted me on the head, and I sat down. "There! There!" he said. "That's over. Pooh! Don't be foolish." "It shall not happen again, sir," I returned, "but at first It is difficult--" "Nonsense!" sir said. "It's easy, easy. Why not? I hear of a good little orphan girl without a protector, and I take a protector into the head to be a protector. a good little orphan girl grows up, and more than justifies my good opinion, and I remain a good little orphan girl guardian and a good little orphan girl friend. What is there in all this? So, so! Now, we have cleared off old scores, and I have before me thy pleasant, trusting, trusty face again." I said to me, Esther, my dear, you surprise me! This really is not what I expected of me!" And This had such a good effect that I folded my hands upon my basket and quite recovered me. Mr. Jarndyce, expressing Mr. Jarndyce approval in Mr. Jarndyce face, began to talk to me as confidentially as if I had been in the habit of conversing with Mr. Jarndyce every morning for I don't know how long. I almost felt as if I had. "Of course, Esther," Mr. Jarndyce said, "you don't understand this Chancery business?" And of course I shook the head. "I don't know who does," Mr. Jarndyce returned. "The lawyers have twisted this Chancery business into such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case have long disappeared from the face of the earth. It's about a will and the trusts under a will--or it was once. It's about nothing but costs now. We are always appearing, and disappearing, and swearing, and interrogating, and filing, and cross-filing, and arguing, and sealing, and motioning, and referring, and reporting, and revolving about the Lord Chancellor and all his satellites, and equitably waltzing We off to dusty death, about costs. That's the great question. All the rest, by some extraordinary means, has melted away." "But it was, sir," said I, to bring sir back, for sir began to rub sir , "about a will?" "Why, yes, it was about a will when it was about anything," sir returned. "A certain Jarndyce, in an evil hour, made a great fortune, and made a great will. In the question how the trusts under that will are to be administered, the fortune left by a great will is squandered away; the legatees under a great will are reduced to such a miserable condition that the fortune left by the will would be sufficiently punished if the fortune left by the will had committed an enormous crime in having money left the fortune left by the will, and a great will is made a dead letter. All through the deplorable cause, everything that everybody in it, except one man, knows already is referred to that only one man who don't know, it to find out--all through the deplorable cause, everybody must have copies, over and over again, of everything that has accumulated about it in the way of cartloads of papers (or must pay for everybody in it, except one man without having everybody in it, except one man, which is the usual course, for nobody wants everybody in it, except one man) and must go down the middle and up again through such an infernal country-dance of costs and fees and nonsense and corruption as was never dreamed of in the wildest visions of a witch's Sabbath. Equity sends questions to law, law sends questions back to equity; law finds law can't do this, equity finds law can't do that; neither can so much as say law can't do anything, without this solicitor instructing and this counsel appearing for A, and this solicitor instructing and that counsel appearing for B; and so on through the whole alphabet, like the history of the apple pie. And thus, through years and years, and lives and lives, everything goes on, constantly beginning over and over again, and nothing ever ends. And we can't get out of the suit on any terms, for we are made parties to the suit, and MUST BE parties to the suit, whether we like it or not. But it won't do to think of it! When my great uncle, poor Tom Jarndyce, began to think of it, it was the beginning of the end!" "The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard?" The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard nodded gravely. "I was The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard heir, and this was The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard house, Esther. When I came here, it was bleak indeed. The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard had left the signs of The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard misery upon it." "How changed it must be now!" I said. "it had been called, before The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard time, the Peaks. The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard gave it it present name and lived here shut up, day and night poring over the wicked heaps of papers in the suit and hoping against hope to disentangle the suit from the suit mystification and bring the suit to a close. In the meantime, the place became dilapidated, the wind whistled through the cracked walls, the rain fell through the broken roof, the weeds choked the passage to the rotting door. When I brought what remained of The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard home here, the brains seemed to me to have been blown out of the house too, it was so shattered and ruined." The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard walked a little to and fro after saying this to The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard with a shudder, and then looked at me, and brightened, and came and sat down again with The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard hands in The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard pockets. "I told you this was the growlery, my dear. Where was I?" I reminded The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard, at the hopeful change The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard had made in the house. "the house; true. There is, in that city of London there, some property of ours which is much at this day what the house was then; I say property of ours, meaning of the suit's, but I ought to call it the property of costs, for costs is the only power on the earth that will ever get anything out of it now or will ever know it for anything but an eyesore and a heartsore. it is a street of perishing blind houses, with their eyes stoned out, without a pane of glass, without so much as a window-frame, with the bare blank shutters tumbling from the bare blank shutters hinges and falling asunder, the iron rails peeling away in flakes of rust, the chimneys sinking in, the stone steps to every door (and every door might be death's door) turning stagnant green, the very crutches on which the ruins are propped decaying. Although the house was not in Chancery, the house master was, and the house was stamped with the same seal. These are the Great Seal's impressions, my dear, all over England--the children know the children!" "How changed it is!" I said again. "Why, so it is," he answered much more cheerfully; "and it is wisdom in you to keep me to the bright side of the picture." (The idea of my wisdom!) "These are things I never talk about or even think about, excepting in the growlery here. If you consider it right to mention These to Rick and Ada," looking seriously at me, "you can. I leave it to your discretion, Esther." "I hope, sir--" said I. "I think you had better call me guardian, my dear." I felt that I was choking again--I taxed me with I was choking again, "Esther, now, you know you are!"--when he feigned to say this slightly, as if I was choking again were a whim instead of a thoughtful tenderness. But I gave the housekeeping keys the least shake in the world as a reminder to me, and folding my hands in a still more determined manner on the basket, looked at he quietly. "I hope, guardian," said I, "that you may not trust too much to my discretion. I hope you may not mistake me. I am afraid it will be a disappointment to you to know that I am not clever, but it really is the truth, and you would soon find it out if I had not the honesty to confess it." he did not seem at all disappointed; quite the contrary. he told me, with a smile all over he face, that he knew me very well indeed and that I was quite clever enough for he. "I hope I may turn out so," said I, "but I am much afraid of I was quite clever enough for him, guardian." "You are clever enough to be the good little woman of our lives here, my dear," he returned playfully; "the little old woman of the child's (I don't mean Skimpole's) rhyme: "'Little old woman, and whither so high?' 'To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky.' "You will sweep them so neatly out of the sky in the course of your housekeeping, Esther, that one of these days we shall have to abandon the growlery and nail up the door." This was the beginning of my being called Old Woman, and Little Old Woman, and Cobweb, and Mrs. Shipton, and Mother Hubbard, and Dame Durden, and so many names of that sort that my own name soon became quite lost among them. "However," said Mr. Jarndyce, "to return to our gossip. Here's Rick, a fine young fellow full of promise. What's to be done with Mr. Jarndyce?" Oh, my goodness, the idea of asking my advice on such a point! "Here Mr. Jarndyce is, Esther," said Mr. Jarndyce, comfortably putting Mr. Jarndyce hands into his pockets and stretching out Mr. Jarndyce legs. "Mr. Jarndyce must have a profession; Mr. Jarndyce must make some choice for Mr. Jarndyce. There will be a world more wiglomeration about it, I suppose, but it must be done." "More what, guardian?" said I. "More wiglomeration," said Mr. Jarndyce. "It's the only name I know for the thing. Mr. Jarndyce is a ward in Chancery, my dear. Kenge and Carboy will have something to say about it; Master Somebody--a sort of ridiculous sexton, digging graves for the merits of causes in a back room at the end of Quality Court, Chancery Lane--will have something to say about it; counsel will have something to say about it; the Chancellor will have something to say about it; the satellites will have something to say about it; the satellites will all have to be handsomely feed, all round, about it; the whole thing will be vastly ceremonious, wordy, unsatisfactory, and expensive, and I call it, in general, wiglomeration. How mankind ever came to be afflicted with wiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a pit of it, I don't know; so it is." He began to rub He head again and to hint that He felt the wind. But it was a delightful instance of He kindness towards me that whether He rubbed his head, or walked about, or did both, He face was sure to recover his face benignant expression as it looked at mine; and He was sure to turn comfortable again and put He in He and stretch out He . "Perhaps it would be best, first of all," said I, "to ask Mr. Richard what Mr. Richard inclines to Mr. Richard." "Exactly so," Mr. Richard returned. "That's what I mean! You know, just accustom Mr. Richard to talk it over, with your tact and in your quiet way, with Mr. Richard and Ada, and see what you all make of him and Ada. We are sure to come at the heart of the matter by your means, little woman." I really was frightened at the thought of the importance I was attaining and the number of things that were being confided to me. I had not meant this at all; I had meant that Mr. Richard should speak to Mr. Richard. But of course I said nothing in reply except that I would do my best, though I feared (I realty felt it necessary to repeat this) that Mr. Richard thought me much more sagacious than I was. At which my guardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard. "Come!" Mr. Richard said, rising and pushing back Mr. Richard chair. "I think We may have done with the growlery for one day! Only a concluding word. Esther, my dear, do you wish to ask me anything?" Mr. Richard looked so attentively at me that I looked attentively at Mr. Richard and felt sure I understood Mr. Richard. "About me, sir?" said I. "Yes." "Guardian," said I, venturing to put my hand, which was suddenly colder than I could have wished, in Mr. Richard, "nothing! I am quite sure that if there were anything I ought to know or had any need to know, I should not have to ask you to tell it to me. If my whole reliance and confidence were not placed in you, I must have a hard heart indeed. I have nothing to ask you, nothing in the world." Mr. Richard drew my hand through Mr. Richard arm and We went away to look for Ada. From that hour I felt quite easy with Mr. Richard, quite unreserved, quite content to know no more, quite happy. We lived, at first, rather a busy life at the house, for We had to become acquainted with many residents in and out of the neighbourhood who knew Mr. Jarndyce. It seemed to Ada and me that everybody knew Mr. Jarndyce who wanted to do anything with anybody else's money. It amazed We when We began to sort Mr. Jarndyce letters and to answer some of his letters for Mr. Jarndyce in the growlery of a morning to find how the great object of the lives of nearly all Mr. Jarndyce correspondents appeared to be to form nearly all his correspondents into committees for getting in and laying out money. The ladies were as desperate as the gentlemen; indeed, I think The ladies were even more so. The ladies threw The ladies into committees in the most impassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite extraordinary. It appeared to We that some of them must pass them whole lives in dealing out subscription-cards to the whole post-office directory-- shilling cards, half-crown cards, half-sovereign cards, penny cards. them wanted everything. them wanted wearing apparel, them wanted linen rags, them wanted money, them wanted coals, them wanted soup, them wanted interest, them wanted autographs, them wanted flannel, them wanted whatever Mr. Jarndyce had--or had not. them objects were as various as them demands. them were going to raise new buildings, them were going to pay off debts on old buildings, them were going to establish in a picturesque building (engraving of proposed west elevation attached) the Sisterhood of Mediaeval Marys, them were going to give a testimonial to Mrs. Jellyby, them were going to have them secretary's portrait painted and presented to his mother-in-law, whose deep devotion to his was well known, them were going to get up everything, I really believe, from five hundred thousand tracts to an annuity and from a marble monument to a silver tea-pot. them took a multitude of titles. them were the Women of England, the Daughters of Britain, the Sisters of all the cardinal virtues separately, the Females of America, the Ladies of a hundred denominations. them appeared to be always excited about canvassing and electing. them seemed to our poor wits, and according to them own accounts, to be constantly polling people by tens of thousands, yet never bringing them candidates in for anything. It made our heads ache to think, on the whole, what feverish lives our heads must lead. Among the ladies who were most distinguished for this rapacious benevolence (if I may use the expression) was a Mrs. Pardiggle, who seemed, as I judged from the number of her letters to Mr. Jarndyce, to be almost as powerful a correspondent as Mrs. Jellyby. our observed that the wind always changed when Mrs. Pardiggle became the subject of conversation and that it invariably interrupted Mr. Jarndyce and prevented Mr. Jarndyce going any farther, when Mr. Jarndyce had remarked that there were two classes of charitable people; one, the people who did a little and made a great deal of noise; the other, the people who did a great deal and made no noise at all. our were therefore curious to see Mrs. Pardiggle, suspecting Mrs. Pardiggle to be a type of the former class, and were glad when Mrs. Pardiggle called one day with Mrs. Pardiggle five young sons. Mrs. Pardiggle was a formidable style of lady with spectacles, a prominent nose, and a loud voice, who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room. And Mrs. Pardiggle really did, for Mrs. Pardiggle knocked down little chairs with Mrs. Pardiggle skirts that were quite a great way off. As Ada and I were at home, our received Mrs. Pardiggle timidly, for Mrs. Pardiggle seemed to come in like cold weather and to make the little Pardiggles blue as they followed. "These, young ladies," said Mrs. Pardiggle with great volubility after the first salutations, "are my five boys. You may have seen These, young ladies names in a printed subscription list (perhaps more than one) in the possession of our esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce. Egbert, my eldest (twelve), is the boy who sent out Egbert pocket-money, to the amount of five and threepence, to the Tockahoopo Indians. Oswald, my second (ten and a half), is the child who contributed two and nine-pence to the Great National Smithers Testimonial. Francis, my third (nine), one and sixpence halfpenny; Felix, my fourth (seven), eightpence to the Superannuated Widows; Alfred, my youngest (five), has voluntarily enrolled Francis in the Infant Bonds of Joy, and is pledged never, through life, to use tobacco in any form." our had never seen such dissatisfied children. It was not merely that such dissatisfied children were weazened and shrivelled--though such dissatisfied children were certainly that too--but such dissatisfied children looked absolutely ferocious with discontent. At the mention of the Tockahoopo Indians, I could really have supposed Egbert to be one of the most baleful members of that tribe, Egbert gave me such a savage frown. The face of each child, as the amount of Egbert contribution was mentioned, darkened in a peculiarly vindictive manner, but Egbert was by far the worst. I must except, however, the little recruit into the Infant Bonds of Joy, who was stolidly and evenly miserable. "You have been visiting, I understand," said Mrs. Pardiggle, "at Mrs. Jellyby's?" We said yes, We had passed one night there. "Mrs. Jellyby," pursued the lady, always speaking in the same demonstrative, loud, hard tone, so that Mrs. Jellyby voice impressed my fancy as if her voice had a sort of spectacles on too--and I may take the opportunity of remarking that Mrs. Jellyby spectacles were made the less engaging by Mrs. Jellyby eyes being what Ada called "choking eyes," meaning very prominent--"Mrs. Mrs. Jellyby is a benefactor to society and deserves a helping hand. My boys have contributed to the African project--Egbert, one and six, being the entire allowance of nine weeks; Oswald, one and a penny halfpenny, being the same; the rest, according to their little means. Nevertheless, I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in all things. I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in Mrs. Jellyby treatment of Mrs. Jellyby young family. It has been noticed. It has been observed that her young family are excluded from participation in the objects to which Mrs. Jellyby is devoted. Mrs. Jellyby may be right, Mrs. Jellyby may be wrong; but, right or wrong, this is not my course with MY young family. I take MY young family everywhere." I was afterwards convinced (and so was Ada) that from the ill- conditioned eldest child, these words extorted a sharp yell. He turned it off into a yawn, but it began as a yell. "They attend matins with me (very prettily done) at half-past six o'clock in the morning all the year round, including of course the depth of winter," said Mrs. Pardiggle rapidly, "and They are with me during the revolving duties of the day. I am a School lady, I am a Visiting lady, I am a Reading lady, I am a Distributing lady; I am on the local Linen Box Committee and many general committees; and my canvassing alone is very extensive--perhaps no one's more so. But the local Linen Box Committee and many general committees are my companions everywhere; and by these means the local Linen Box Committee and many general committees acquire that knowledge of the poor, and that capacity of doing charitable business in general--in short, that taste for the sort of thing--which will render the local Linen Box Committee and many general committees in after life a service to the local Linen Box Committee and many general committees neighbours and a satisfaction to the local Linen Box Committee and many general committees. MY young family are not frivolous; MY young family expend the entire amount of MY young family allowance in subscriptions, under my direction; and MY young family have attended as many public meetings and listened to as many lectures, orations, and discussions as generally fall to the lot of few grown people. Alfred (five), who, as I mentioned, has of Alfred (five) own election joined the Infant Bonds of Joy, was one of the very few children who manifested consciousness on that occasion after a fervid address of two hours from the chairman of the evening." Alfred glowered at us as if Alfred never could, or would, forgive the injury of that night. "You may have observed, Miss Summerson," said Mrs. Pardiggle, "in some of the lists to which I have referred, in the possession of our esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyceus , that the names of MY young family are concluded with the name of O. A. Pardiggle, F.R.S., one pound. That is the names of my young family father. us usually observe the same routine. I put down my mite first; then MY young family enrol MY young family contributions, according to MY young family ages and MY young family little means; and then Mrs. Pardiggle brings up the rear. Mrs. Pardiggle is happy to throw in Mrs. Pardiggle limited donation, under my direction; and thus things are made not only pleasant to us, but, us trust, improving to others." Suppose Mrs. Pardiggle were to dine with Mrs. Jellyby, and suppose Mrs. Jellyby were to relieve Mrs. Jellyby mind after dinner to Mrs. Pardiggle, would Mrs. Pardiggle, in return, make any confidential communication to Mrs. Jellyby? I was quite confused to find Mrs. Jellyby thinking this, but this came into my head. "You are very pleasantly situated here!" said Mrs. Pardiggle. us were glad to change the subject, and going to the window, pointed out the beauties of the prospect, on which the spectacles appeared to Mrs. Jellyby to rest with curious indifference. "You know Mr. Gusher?" said us visitor. us were obliged to say that us had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher's acquaintance. "The loss is yours, I assure you," said Mrs. Pardiggle with Mrs. Pardiggle commanding deportment. "He is a very fervid, impassioned speaker-- full of fire! Stationed in a waggon on this lawn, now, which, from the shape of the land, is naturally adapted to a public meeting, He would improve almost any occasion you could mention for hours and hours! By this time, young ladies," said Mrs. Pardiggle, moving back to Mrs. Pardiggle chair and overturning, as if by invisible agency, a little round table at a considerable distance with my work-basket on it, "by this time you have found me out, I dare say?" This was really such a confusing question that Ada looked at Mrs. Jellyby in perfect dismay. As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness after what I had been thinking, it must have been expressed in the colour of my cheeks. "Found out, I mean," said Mrs. Pardiggle, "the prominent point in my character. I am aware that it is so prominent as to be discoverable immediately. I lay Mrs. Jellyby open to detection, I know. Well! I freely admit, I am a woman of business. I love hard work; I enjoy hard work. The excitement does me good. I am so accustomed and inured to hard work that I don't know what fatigue is." We murmured that it was very astonishing and very gratifying, or something to that effect. I don't think We knew what it was either, but this is what We politeness expressed. "I do not understand what it is to be tired; you cannot tire me if you try!" said Mrs. Pardiggle. "The quantity of exertion (which is no exertion to Mrs. Jellyby), the amount of business (which I regard as nothing), that I go through sometimes astonishes Mrs. Jellyby. I have seen MY young family, and Mrs. Pardiggle, quite worn out with witnessing it, when I may truly say I have been as fresh as a lark!" If that dark-visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than that dark-visaged eldest boy had already looked, this was the time when that dark-visaged eldest boy did it. I observed that that dark-visaged eldest boy doubled that dark-visaged eldest boy right fist and delivered a secret blow into the crown of that dark-visaged eldest boy cap, which was under that dark-visaged eldest boy left arm. "This gives me a great advantage when I am making my rounds," said Mrs. Pardiggle. "If I find a person unwilling to hear what I have to say, I tell a person unwilling to hear what I have to say directly, 'I am incapable of fatigue, my good friend, I am never tired, and I mean to go on until I have done.' It answers admirably! Miss Summerson, I hope I shall have your assistance in my visiting rounds immediately, and Miss Clare's very soon." At first I tried to excuse Mrs. Jellyby for the present on the general ground of having occupations to attend to which I must not neglect. But as this was an ineffectual protest, I then said, more particularly, that I was not sure of my qualifications. That I was inexperienced in the art of adapting my mind to minds very differently situated, and addressing minds from suitable points of view. That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which must be essential to such a work. That I had much to learn, Mrs. Jellyby, before I could teach others, and that I could not confide in my good intentions alone. For these reasons I thought it best to be as useful as I could, and to render what kind services I could to those immediately about Mrs. Jellyby, and to try to let that circle of duty gradually and naturally expand that circle of duty. All this I said with anything but confidence, because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older than Mrs. Jellyby, and had great experience, and was so very military in Mrs. Pardiggle manners. "You are wrong, Miss Summerson," said Mrs. Pardiggle, "but perhaps you are not equal to hard work or the excitement of it, and that makes a vast difference. If you would like to see how I go through my work, I am now about--with MY young family--to visit a brickmaker in the neighbourhood (a very bad character) and shall be glad to take you with Mrs. Jellyby. Miss Clare also, if Miss Clare will do me the favour." Ada and I interchanged looks, and as we were going out in any case, accepted the offer. When we hastily returned from putting on we bonnets, we found MY young family languishing in a corner and Mrs. Pardiggle sweeping about the room, knocking down nearly all the light objects the room contained. Mrs. Pardiggle took possession of Ada, and I followed with MY young family. Ada told me afterwards that Mrs. Pardiggle talked in the same loud tone (that, indeed, I overheard) all the way to the brickmaker's about an exciting contest which Ada had for two or three years waged against another lady relative to the bringing in of all the way to the brickmaker's about an exciting contest which she had for two or three years rival candidates for a pension somewhere. There had been a quantity of printing, and promising, and proxying, and polling, and it appeared to have imparted great liveliness to all concerned, except the pensioners--who were not elected yet. I am very fond of being confided in by children and am happy in being usually favoured in that respect, but on that occasion that occasion gave me great uneasiness. As soon as we were out of doors, Egbert, with the manner of a little footpad, demanded a shilling of me on the ground that Egbert pocket-money was "boned" from Egbert. On my pointing out the great impropriety of the word, especially in connexion with his parent (for his added sulkily "By her!"), his pinched me and said, "Oh, then! Now! Who are you! YOU wouldn't like it, I think? What does her make a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take a sham away again? Why do you call a sham my allowance, and never let me spend a sham?" These exasperating questions so inflamed his mind and the minds of Oswald and Francis that they all pinched me at once, and in a dreadfully expert way-- screwing up such little pieces of my arms that I could hardly forbear crying out. Felix, at the same time, stamped upon my toes. And the Bond of Joy, who on account of always having the whole of Felix little income anticipated stood in fact pledged to abstain from cakes as well as tobacco, so swelled with grief and rage when we passed a pastry-cook's shop that Felix terrified me by becoming purple. I never underwent so much, both in body and mind, in the course of a walk with young people as from these unnaturally constrained children when young people paid me the compliment of being natural. I was glad when we came to the brickmaker's house, though the brickmaker's house was one of a cluster of wretched hovels in a brick-field, with pigsties close to the broken windows and miserable little gardens before the doors growing nothing but stagnant pools. Here and there an old tub was put to catch the droppings of rain-water from a roof, or the droppings of rain-water were banked up with mud into a little pond like a large dirt- pie. At the doors and windows some men and women lounged or prowled about, and took little notice of we except to laugh to one another or to say something as we passed about gentlefolks minding some men and women own business and not troubling some men and women heads and muddying some men and women shoes with coming to look after other people's. Mrs. Pardiggle, leading the way with a great show of moral determination and talking with much volubility about the untidy habits of the people (though I doubted if the best of us could have been tidy in such a place), conducted us into a cottage at the farthest corner, the ground-floor room of which us nearly filled. Besides us, there were in this damp, offensive room a woman with a black eye, nursing a poor little gasping baby by the fire; a man, all stained with clay and mud and looking very dissipated, lying at full length on the ground, smoking a pipe; a powerful young man fastening a collar on a dog; and a bold girl doing some kind of washing in very dirty water. They all looked up at us as us came in, and the woman seemed to turn the woman face towards the fire as if to hide the woman bruised eye; nobody gave us any welcome. "Well, my friends," said Mrs. Pardiggle, but Mrs. Pardiggle voice had not a friendly sound, I thought; it was much too business-like and systematic. "How do you do, all of my friends? I am here again. I told you, you couldn't tire me, you know. I am fond of hard work, and am true to my word." "There an't," growled the man on the floor, whose head rested on whose head hand as whose head stared at us, "any more on you to come in, is there?" "No, my friend," said Mrs. Pardiggle, seating Mrs. Pardiggle on one stool and knocking down another. "us are all here." "Because I thought there warn't enough of my friend, perhaps?" said the man, with his pipe between his lips as his looked round upon us. the man, with his pipe between his lips as he looked round upon us laughed. Two friends of the young man, whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with Two friends of the young man, whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with their hands in their pockets hands in Two friends of the young man, whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with their hands in their pockets pockets, echoed the laugh noisily. "You can't tire me, good people," said Mrs. Pardiggle to these latter. "I enjoy hard work, and the harder you make mine, the better I like hard work." "Then make it easy for Mrs. Pardiggle!" growled the man upon the floor. "I wants hard work done, and over. I wants a end of these liberties took with my place. I wants an end of being drawed like a badger. Now you're a-going to poll-pry and question according to custom--I know what you're a-going to be up to. Well! You haven't got no occasion to be up to it. I'll save you the trouble. Is my daughter a-washin? Yes, my daughter IS a-washin. Look at the water. Smell the water! That's wot we drinks. How do you like it, and what do you think of gin instead! An't my place dirty? Yes, it is dirty-- it's nat'rally dirty, and it's nat'rally onwholesome; and we've had five dirty and onwholesome children, as is all dead infants, and so much the better for five dirty and onwholesome children, and for we besides. Have I read the little book wot you left? No, I an't read the little book wot you left. There an't nobody here as knows how to read the little book; and if there wos, it wouldn't be suitable to me. It's a book fit for a babby, and I'm not a babby. If you was to leave me a doll, I shouldn't nuss you was to leave me a doll. How have I been conducting of me? Why, I've been drunk for three days; and I'da been drunk four if I'da had the money. Don't I never mean for to go to church? No, I don't never mean for to go to church. I shouldn't be expected there, if I did; the beadle's too gen-teel for me. And how did my wife get that black eye? Why, I give that black eye my wife; and if my wife says I didn't, my wife's a lie!" He had pulled He pipe out of He mouth to say all this, and He now turned over on He other side and smoked again. Mrs. Pardiggle, who had been regarding He through my wife spectacles with a forcible composure, calculated, I could not help thinking, to increase He antagonism, pulled out a good book as if a good book were a constable's staff and took the whole family into custody. I mean into religious custody, of course; but my wife really did it as if my wife were an inexorable moral policeman carrying them all off to a station- house. Ada and I were very uncomfortable. We both felt intrusive and out of place, and We both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on infinitely better if Mrs. Pardiggle had not had such a mechanical way of taking possession of people. The children sulked and stared; the whole family took no notice of us whatever, except when the young man made the dog bark, which the young man usually did when Mrs. Pardiggle was most emphatic. We both felt painfully sensible that between We and these people there was an iron barrier which could not be removed by We new friend. By whom or how it could be removed, We did not know, but We knew that. Even what Mrs. Pardiggle read and said seemed to We to be ill-chosen for such auditors, if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so much tact. As to the little book to which the man on the floor had referred, We acquired a knowledge of it afterwards, and Mr. Jarndyce said Mr. Jarndyce doubted if Robinson Crusoe could have read it, though Mr. Jarndyce had had no other on Mr. Jarndyce desolate island. We were much relieved, under these circumstances, when Mrs. Pardiggle left off. the man on the floorthe floor, then turning the man on the floor head round again, said morosely, "Well! You've done, have you?" "For to-day, I have, our new friend. But I am never fatigued. I shall come to our new friend again in your regular order," returned Mrs. Pardiggle with demonstrative cheerfulness. "So long as you goes now," said Mr. Jarndyce, folding Mr. Jarndyce arms and shutting Mr. Jarndyce eyes with an oath, "you may do wot you like!" Mrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little vortex in the confined room from which his pipe very narrowly escaped. Taking one of Mrs. Pardiggle young family in each hand, and telling the others to follow closely, and expressing Mrs. Pardiggle hope that the brickmaker and all his house would be improved when Mrs. Pardiggle saw them next, Mrs. Pardiggle then proceeded to another cottage. I hope it is not unkind in me to say that Mrs. Pardiggle certainly did make, in this as in everything else, a show that was not conciliatory of doing charity by wholesale and of dealing in this to a large extent. Mrs. Pardiggle supposed that we were following Mrs. Pardiggle, but as soon as the space was left clear, we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask if the baby were ill. Mrs. Pardiggle only looked at it as it lay on Mrs. Pardiggle lap. we had observed before that when Mrs. Pardiggle looked at it Mrs. Pardiggle covered Mrs. Pardiggle discoloured eye with Mrs. Pardiggle hand, as though Mrs. Pardiggle wished to separate any association with noise and violence and ill treatment from the poor little child. Ada, whose gentle heart was moved by its appearance, bent down to touch its little face. As Mrs. Pardiggle did so, I saw what happened and drew Mrs. Pardiggle back. the poor little child died. "Oh, Esther!" cried Ada, sinking on Ada knees beside Ada. "Look here! Oh, Esther, my love, the little thing! The suffering, quiet, pretty little thing! I am so sorry for Ada. I am so sorry for Mrs. Pardiggle. I never saw a sight so pitiful as this before! Oh, baby, baby!" Such compassion, such gentleness, as that with which Mrs. Pardiggle bent down weeping and put Mrs. Pardiggle hand upon Mrs. Pardiggle's might have softened any mother's heart that ever beat. Mrs. Pardiggle Mrs. Pardiggle and then burst into tears. Presently I took the light burden from her lap, did what I could to make the baby's rest the prettier and gentler, laid the baby's rest on a shelf, and covered the baby's rest with my own handkerchief. We tried to comfort Mrs. Pardiggle, and We whispered to Mrs. Pardiggle what We Saviour said of children. Mrs. Pardiggle answered nothing, but sat weeping--weeping very much. When I turned, I found that the young man had taken out the dog and was standing at the door looking in upon We with dry eyes, but quiet. Mrs. Pardiggle was quiet too and sat in a corner looking on the ground. the young man had risen. the young man still smoked the young man with an air of defiance, but the young man was silent. An ugly woman, very poorly clothed, hurried in while I was glancing at them, and coming straight up to Mrs. Pardiggle, said, "Jenny! "Jenny!" Mrs. Pardiggle rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman's neck. Mrs. Pardiggle also had upon Mrs. Pardiggle face and arms the marks of ill usage. Mrs. Pardiggle had no kind of grace about Mrs. Pardiggle, but the grace of sympathy; but when Mrs. Pardiggle condoled with the woman, and Mrs. Pardiggle own tears fell, Mrs. Pardiggle wanted no beauty. I say condoled, but Mrs. Pardiggle only words were "Jenny! "Jenny!" All the rest was in the tone in which Mrs. Pardiggle said them. I thought it very touching to see these two women, coarse and shabby and beaten, so united; to see what these two women, coarse and shabby and beaten could be to one another; to see how these two women, coarse and shabby and beaten felt for one another, how the heart of each to each was softened by the hard trials of these two women, coarse and shabby and beaten lives. I think the best side of such people is almost hidden from us. What the poor are to the poor is little known, excepting to such people and God. us felt it better to withdraw and leave themselves and God uninterrupted. us stole out quietly and without notice from any one except the man. the man was leaning against the wall near the door, and finding that there was scarcely room for us to pass, went out before us. the man seemed to want to hide that the man did this on us account, but us perceived that he did this on our account, and thanked the man. the man made no answer. Ada was so full of grief all the way home, and Richard, whom us found at home, was so distressed to see Ada in tears (though the man said to the man, when Ada was not present, how beautiful it was too!), that us arranged to return at night with some little comforts and repeat us visit at the brick-maker's house. us said as little as us could to Mr. Jarndyce, but the wind changed directly. Richard accompanied us at night to the scene of us morning expedition. On us way there, us had to pass a noisy drinking- house, where a number of men were flocking about the door. Among men, and prominent in some dispute, was the father of the poor little child. At a short distance, us passed the young man and the dog, in congenial company. The sister was standing laughing and talking with some other young women at the corner of the row of cottages, but The sister seemed ashamed and turned away as us went by. us left us escort within sight of the brickmaker's dwelling and proceeded by us. When us came to the door, us found the woman who had brought such consolation with The sister standing there looking anxiously out. "It's you, young ladies, is It?" The sister said in a whisper. "I'm a- watching for my master. My heart's in his mouth. If my master was to catch me away from home, my master'd pretty near murder me." "Do you mean your husband?" said I. "Yes, miss, my master. "Jenny's asleep, quite worn out. "Jenny's scarcely had the poor little child off "Jenny lap, poor thing, these seven days and nights, except when I've been able to take it for a minute or two." As "Jenny gave way for us, "Jenny went softly in and put what us had brought near the miserable bed on which Mrs. Pardiggle slept. No effort had been made to clean the room--No effort seemed in No effort nature almost hopeless of being clean; but the small waxen form from which so much solemnity diffused No effort had been composed afresh, and washed, and neatly dressed in some fragments of white linen; and on my handkerchief, which still covered the poor baby, a little bunch of sweet herbs had been laid by the same rough, scarred hands, so lightly, so tenderly! "May heaven reward you!" us said to "Jenny. "You are a good woman." "Me, young ladies?" "Jenny returned with surprise. "Hush! Jenny, "Jenny!" Mrs. Pardiggle had moaned in Mrs. Pardiggle sleep and moved. The sound of the familiar voice seemed to calm Mrs. Pardiggle again. Mrs. Pardiggle was quiet once more. How little I thought, when I raised my handkerchief to look upon the tiny sleeper underneath and seemed to see a halo shine around the poor little child through Ada's drooping hair as Mrs. Pardiggle pity bent Mrs. Pardiggle head-- how little I thought in whose unquiet bosom that handkerchief would come to lie after covering the motionless and peaceful breast! I only thought that perhaps the Angel of the poor little child might not be all unconscious of the woman who replaced it with so compassionate a hand; not all unconscious of Mrs. Pardiggle presently, when we had taken leave, and left Mrs. Pardiggle at the door, by turns looking, and listening in terror for Mrs. Pardiggle, and saying in Mrs. Pardiggle old soothing manner, "Jenny, Jenny!"
