Esther's Narrative Richard very often came to see us while us remained in London (though Esther's Narrative Richard soon failed in Esther's Narrative Richard letter-writing), and with Esther's Narrative Richard quick abilities, Esther's Narrative Richard good spirits, Esther's Narrative Richard good temper, Esther's Narrative Richard gaiety and freshness, was always delightful.
But though I liked Esther's Narrative Richard more and more the better I knew Esther's Narrative Richard, I still felt more and more how much it was to be regretted that Esther's Narrative Richard had been educated in no habits of application and concentration.
The system which had addressed Esther's Narrative Richard in exactly the same manner as it had addressed hundreds of other boys, all varying in character and capacity, had enabled Esther's Narrative Richard to dash through Esther's Narrative Richard tasks, always with fair credit and often with distinction, but in a fitful, dazzling way that had confirmed Esther's Narrative Richard reliance on those very qualities in Esther's Narrative Richard which it had been most desirable to direct and train.
They were good qualities, without which no high place can be meritoriously won, but like fire and water, though excellent servants, They were very bad masters.
If They had been under Richard's direction, They would have been Richard friends; but Richard being under They direction, They became Richard enemies.
I write down these opinions not because I believe that this or any other thing was so because I thought so, but only because I did think so and I want to be quite candid about all I thought and did.
these opinions were my thoughts about Richard.
I thought I often observed besides how right my guardian was in what my guardian had said, and that the uncertainties and delays of the Chancery suit had imparted to my guardian nature something of the careless spirit of a gamester who felt that my guardian was part of a great gaming system.
Mr. and Mrs. Bayham Badger coming one afternoon when my guardian was not at home, in the course of conversation I naturally inquired after Richard.
"Why, Mr. Carstone," said Mrs. Bayham Badger, "is very well and is, I assure you, a great acquisition to our society.
Captain Swosser used to say of Captain Swosser that I was always better than land a-head and a breeze a-starn to the midshipmen's mess when the purser's junk had become as tough as the fore-topsel weather earings.
It was Captain Swosser naval way of mentioning generally that I was an acquisition to any society.
I may render the same tribute, I am sure, to Mr. Carstone.
But I--you won't think me premature if I mention it?"
I said no, as Mrs. Bayham Badger's insinuating tone seemed to require such an answer.
"Nor Miss Clare?"
said Mrs. Bayham Badger sweetly.
Ada said no, too, and looked uneasy.
"Why, you see, my dears," said Mrs. Bayham Badger, "--you'll excuse me calling you my dears?"
We entreated Mrs. Bayham Badger not to mention it.
"Because you really are, if I may take the liberty of saying so," pursued Mrs. Bayham Badger, "so perfectly charming.
You see, my dears, that although I am still young--or Mrs. Bayham Badger pays me the compliment of saying so--" "No," Mrs. Bayham Badger called out like some one contradicting at a public meeting.
"Not at all!"
"Very well," smiled Mrs. Bayham Badger, "we will say still young."
"Undoubtedly," said Mrs. Bayham Badger.
"my dears, though still young, I have had many opportunities of observing young men.
There were many such on board the dear old Crippler, I assure you.
After that, when I was with Captain Swosser in the Mediterranean, I embraced every opportunity of knowing and befriending the midshipmen under Captain Swosser's command.
YOU never heard knowing and befriending the midshipmen under Captain Swosser's command called the young gentlemen, my dears, and probably would not understand allusions to knowing and befriending the midshipmen under Captain Swosser's command pipe-claying knowing and befriending the midshipmen under Captain Swosser's command weekly accounts, but it is otherwise with me, for blue water has been a second home to me, and I have been quite a sailor.
Again, with Professor Dingo."
"A man of European reputation," murmured Mrs. Bayham Badger.
"When I lost my dear first and became the wife of my dear second," said Mrs. Bayham Badger, speaking of Mrs. Bayham Badger former husbands as if her former husbands were parts of a charade, "I still enjoyed opportunities of observing youth.
The class attendant on Professor Dingo's lectures was a large one, and The class attendant on Professor Dingo's lectures became my pride, as the wife of an eminent scientific man seeking Mrs. Bayham Badger in science the utmost consolation it could impart, to throw our house open to the students as a kind of Scientific Exchange.
Every Tuesday evening there was lemonade and a mixed biscuit for all who chose to partake of those refreshments.
And there was science to an unlimited extent."
"Remarkable assemblies those, Miss Summerson," said Mrs. Bayham Badger reverentially.
"There must have been great intellectual friction going on there under the auspices of such a man!"
"And now," pursued Mrs. Bayham Badger, "now that I am the wife of my dear third, Mrs. Bayham Badger, I still pursue those habits of observation which were formed during the lifetime of Captain Swosser and adapted to new and unexpected purposes during the lifetime of Professor Dingo.
I therefore have not come to the consideration of Mr. Carstone as a neophyte.
And yet I am very much of the opinion, my dears, that my dears has not chosen my dears profession advisedly."
Ada looked so very anxious now that I asked Mrs. Bayham Badger on what Ada founded Ada supposition.
"My dear Miss Summerson," Ada replied, "on Mr. Carstone's character and conduct.
He is of such a very easy disposition that probably He would never think it worth-while to mention how He really feels, but He feels languid about the profession.
He has not that positive interest in it which makes it He vocation.
If He has any decided impression in reference to it, I should say it was that it is a tiresome pursuit.
Now, this is not promising.
Young men like Mr. Allan Woodcourt who take it from a strong interest in all that it can do will find some reward in it through a great deal of work for a very little money and through years of considerable endurance and disappointment.
But I am quite convinced that this would never be the case with Mr.
Carstone."
"Does Mr. Badger think so too?"
asked Ada timidly.
"Why," said Mr. Badger, "to tell the truth, Miss Clare, this view of the matter had not occurred to Mr. Badger until Mr. Badger mentioned it.
But when Mr. Badger put it in that light, I naturally gave great consideration to it, knowing that Mr. Badger's mind, in addition to it natural advantages, has had the rare advantage of being formed by two such very distinguished (I will even say illustrious) public men as Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy and Professor Dingo.
The conclusion at which I have arrived is--in short, is Mr. Badger's conclusion."
"It was a maxim of Captain Swosser's," said Mr. Badger, "speaking in Mr. Badger figurative naval manner, that when you make pitch hot, you cannot make it too hot; and that if you only have to swab a plank, you should swab a plank as if Davy Jones were after you.
It appears to you that this maxim is applicable to the medical as well as to the nautical profession.
"To all professions," observed Mr. Badger.
"It was admirably said by Captain Swosser's.
Beautifully said."
"People objected to Professor Dingo when we were staying in the north of Devon after we marriage," said Mr. Badger, "that Professor Dingo disfigured some of the houses and other buildings by chipping off fragments of those edifices with Professor Dingo little geological hammer.
But Professor Dingo replied that Professor Dingo knew of no building save the Temple of Science.
The principle is the same, I think?"
"Precisely the same," said Mr. Badger.
"Finely expressed!
Professor Dingo made the same remark, Miss Summerson, in Professor Dingo last illness, when (Professor Dingo mind wandering) Professor Dingo insisted on keeping Professor Dingo little hammer under the pillow and chipping at the countenances of the attendants.
The ruling passion!"
Although we could have dispensed with the length at which Mr. and Mrs. Badger pursued the conversation, we both felt that it was disinterested in Mr. and Mrs. Badger to express the opinion Mr. and Mrs. Badger had communicated to we and that there was a great probability of its being sound.
we agreed to say nothing to Mr. Jarndyce until we had spoken to Richard; and as Mr. Jarndyce was coming next evening, we resolved to have a very serious talk with Mr. Jarndyce.
So after Mr. Jarndyce had been a little while with Ada, I went in and found my darling (as I knew Ada would be) prepared to consider Mr. Jarndyce thoroughly right in whatever Mr. Jarndyce said.
"And how do you get on, Richard?"
said I. I always sat down on the other side of Richard.
Richard made quite a sister of Richard.
"Oh!
Well enough!"
said Richard.
"Richard can't say better than that, Esther, can Richard?"
cried my pet triumphantly.
I tried to look at my pet in the wisest manner, but of course I couldn't.
"Well enough?"
I repeated.
"Yes," said Richard, "well enough.
It's rather jog-trotty and humdrum.
But It'll do as well as anything else!"
"Oh!
Richard!"
I remonstrated.
"What's the matter?"
said Richard.
"Do as well as anything else!"
"I don't think there's any harm in that, Dame Durden," said Ada, looking so confidingly at Richard across Ada; "because if it will do as well as anything else, it will do very well, I hope."
"Oh, yes, I hope so," returned Richard, carelessly tossing Richard hair from Richard forehead.
"After all, it may be only a kind of probation till our suit is--I forgot though.
I am not to mention our suit.
Forbidden ground!
Oh, yes, it's all right enough.
Let our talk about something else."
Ada would have done so willingly, and with a full persuasion that our had brought the question to a most satisfactory state.
But I thought it would be useless to stop there, so I began again.
"No, but Richard," said I, "and AdaAda!
Consider how important it is to you both, and what a point of honour it is towards your cousin, that you, Richard, should be quite in earnest without any reservation.
I think we had better talk about this, really, Ada.
It will be too late very soon."
"Oh, yes!
we must talk about it!"
said Ada.
"But I think Richard is right."
What was the use of my trying to look wise when Ada was so pretty, and so engaging, and so fond of Richard!
"Mr. and Mrs. Badger were here yesterday, Richard," said I, "and Mr. and Mrs. Badger seemed disposed to think that you had no great liking for the profession."
"Did Mr. and Mrs. Badger though?"
said Richard.
"Oh!
Well, that rather alters the case, because I had no idea that Mr. and Mrs. Badger thought so, and I should not have liked to disappoint or inconvenience Mr. and Mrs. Badger.
The fact is, I don't care much about it.
But, oh, it don't matter!
it'll do as well as anything else!"
"You hear him, Ada!"
said I.
"The fact is,Richard Richard proceeded, half thoughtfully and half jocosely, "it is not quite in my way.
I don't take to it.
And I get too much of Mrs. Bayham Badger's first and second."
"I am sure THAT'S very natural!"
cried Ada, quite delighted.
"The very thing we both said yesterday, Esther!"
"Then," pursued Richard, "it's monotonous, and to-day is too like yesterday, and to-morrow is too like to-day."
"But I am afraid," said I, "this is an objection to all kinds of application--to life itself, except under some very uncommon circumstances."
"Do you think so?"
returned Richard, still considering.
"Perhaps!
Ha!
Why, then, you know," Richard added, suddenly becoming gay again, "we travel outside a circle to what I said just now.
It'll do as well as anything else.
Oh, it's all right enough!
Let we talk about something else."
But even Ada, with Ada loving face--and if it had seemed innocent and trusting when I first saw it in that memorable November fog, how much more did it seem now when I knew Ada innocent and trusting heart--Ada shook Ada head at this and looked serious.
So I thought this a good opportunity to hint to Richard that if Richard were sometimes a little careless of Richard, I was very sure Richard never meant to be careless of Ada, and that it was a part of Richard affectionate consideration for Ada not to slight the importance of a step that might influence both he were sometimes a little careless of himself, I was very sure he never meant to be careless of Ada, and that it was a part of his affectionate consideration for her not to slight the importance of a step that might influence both their lives lives.
This made Richard almost grave.
"My dear Mother Hubbard," My dear Mother Hubbard said, "that's the very thing!
I have thought of that several times and have been quite angry with My dear Mother Hubbard for meaning to be so much in earnest and--somehow--not exactly being so.
I don't know how it is; I seem to want something or other to stand by.
Even you have no idea how fond I am of Ada (my darling cousin, I love you, so much!
), but I don't settle down to constancy in other things.
It's such uphill work, and It takes such a time!"
said Richard with an air of vexation.
"That may be," I suggested, "because you don't like what you have chosen."
"Poor fellow!"
said Ada.
"I am sure I don't wonder at it!"
No.
It was not of the least use my trying to look wise.
I tried again, but how could I do it, or how could it have any effect if I could, while Ada rested Ada clasped hands upon Ada shoulder and while Ada looked at Ada tender blue eyes, and while they looked at Ada!
"You see, my precious girl," said Richard, passing Ada golden curls through and through Richard hand, "I was a little hasty perhaps; or I misunderstood my own inclinations perhaps.
They don't seem to lie in that direction.
I couldn't tell till I tried.
Now the question is whether it's worth-while to undo all that has been done.
It seems like making a great disturbance about nothing particular."
"Richard," said I, "how CAN you say about nothing particular?"
"I don't mean absolutely that," Richard returned.
"I mean that it MAY be nothing particular because I may never want it."
Both Ada and I urged, in reply, not only that it was decidedly worth-while to undo what had been done, but that it must be undone.
I then asked Richard whether Richard had thought of any more congenial pursuit.
"There, my dear Mrs. Shipton," said Richard, "you touch me home.
Yes, I have.
I have been thinking that the law is the boy for me."
"The law!"
repeated Ada as if Ada were afraid of the name.
"If I went into Kenge's office," said Richard, "and if I were placed under articles to Kenge, I should have my eye on the--hum!-- the forbidden ground--and should be able to study my eye on the--hum!-- the forbidden ground, and master my eye on the--hum!-- the forbidden ground, and to satisfy Richard that my eye on the--hum!-- the forbidden ground was not neglected and was being properly conducted.
I should be able to look after Ada's interests and my own interests (the same thing!
); and I should peg away at Blackstone and all those fellows with the most tremendous ardour."
I was not by any means so sure of that, and I saw how his hankering after the vague things yet to come of those long-deferred hopes cast a shade on Ada's face.
But I thought it best to encourage his in any project of continuous exertion, and only advised his to be quite sure that his mind was made up now.
"My dear Minerva," said Richard, "I am as steady as you are.
I made a mistake; we are all liable to mistakes; I won't do so any more, and I'll become such a lawyer as is not often seen.
That is, you know," said Richard, relapsing into doubt, "if it really is worth-while, after all, to make such a disturbance about nothing particular!"
This led to our saying again, with a great deal of gravity, all that our had said already and to our coming to much the same conclusion afterwards.
But our so strongly advised Richard to be frank and open with Mr. Jarndyce, without a moment's delay, and Richard disposition was naturally so opposed to concealment that Richard sought Richard out at once (taking our with Richard) and made a full avowal.
"Rick," said my guardian, after hearing Rick attentively, "we can retreat with honour, and we will.
But we must be careful--for we cousin's sake, Rick, for our cousin's sake--that we make no more such mistakes.
Therefore, in the matter of the law, we will have a good trial before we decide.
we will look before we leap, and take plenty of time about we leap."
Richard's energy was of such an impatient and fitful kind that Richard would have liked nothing better than to have gone to Mr. Kenge's office in that hour and to have entered into articles with Mr. Kenge on the spot.
Submitting, however, with a good grace to the caution that we had shown to be so necessary, Mr. Kenge contented Mr. Kenge with sitting down among we in Mr. Kenge lightest spirits and talking as if Mr. Kenge one unvarying purpose in life from childhood had been that one which now held possession of Mr. Kenge.
my guardian was very kind and cordial with Mr. Kenge, but rather grave, enough so to cause Ada, when Mr. Kenge had departed and we were going upstairs to bed, to say, "Cousin John, I hope you don't think the worse of Richard?"
"No, my love," said Richard.
"Because it was very natural that Richard should be mistaken in such a difficult case.
It is not uncommon."
"No, no, my love," said Richard.
"Don't look unhappy."
"Oh, I am not unhappy, Cousin John!"
said Ada, smiling cheerfully, with Ada hand upon Cousin John shoulder, where Ada had put it in bidding Cousin John good night.
"But I should be a little so if you thought at all the worse of Richard."
"My dear," said Mr. Jarndyce, "I should think the worse of Mr. Jarndyce only if you were ever in the least unhappy through Mr. Jarndyce means.
I should be more disposed to quarrel with Mr. Jarndyce even then, than with RickRick, for I brought you together.
But, tut, all this is nothing!
Mr. Jarndyce has time before Mr. Jarndyce, and the race to run.
I think the worse of Mr. Jarndyce?
Not I, my loving cousin!
And not you, I swear!"
"No, indeed, cousin John," said Ada, "I am sure I could not--I am sure I would not--think any ill of Richard if the whole world did.
I could, and I would, think better of Mr. Jarndyce then than at any other time!"
So quietly and honestly Ada said it, with Ada hands upon Mr. Jarndyce shoulders--both hands now--and looking up into Mr. Jarndyce face, like the picture of truth!
"I think," said my guardian, thoughtfully regarding Ada, "I think my guardian must be somewhere written that the virtues of the mothers shall occasionally be visited on the children, as well as the sins of the father.
Good night, my rosebud.
Good night, little woman.
Pleasant slumbers!
Happy dreams!"
This was the first time I ever saw Mr. Jarndyce follow Ada with Mr. Jarndyce eyes with something of a shadow on their benevolent expression.
I well remembered the look with which Mr. Jarndyce had contemplated Ada and Richard when Ada was singing in the firelight; it was but a very little while since Mr. Jarndyce had watched them passing down the room in which the sun was shining, and away into the shade; but Mr. Jarndyce glance was changed, and even the silent look of confidence in Mr. Jarndyce which now followed his glance once more was not quite so hopeful and untroubled as his glance had originally been.
Ada praised Richard more to Mr. Jarndyce that night than ever Ada had praised Richard yet.
Ada went to sleep with a little bracelet Richard had given Ada clasped upon Ada arm.
I fancied Ada was dreaming of Richard when I kissed Ada cheek after Ada had slept an hour and saw how tranquil and happy Ada looked.
For I was so little inclined to sleep Mr. Jarndyce that night that I sat up working.
It would not be worth mentioning for It own sake, but I was wakeful and rather low-spirited.
I don't know why.
At least I don't think I know why.
At least, perhaps I do, but I don't think it matters.
At any rate, I made up my mind to be so dreadfully industrious that I would leave Mr. Jarndyce not a moment's leisure to be low-spirited.
For I naturally said, "Esther!
You to be low-spirited.
YOU!"
And it really was time to say so, for Mr. Jarndyce--yes, I really did see Mr. Jarndyce in the glass, almost crying.
"As if you had anything to make you unhappy, instead of everything to make you happy, you ungrateful heart!"
said I.
If I could have made Mr. Jarndyce go to sleep, I would have done it directly, but not being able to do that, I took out of my basket some ornamental work for our house (I mean Bleak House) that I was busy with at that time and sat down to it with great determination.
It was necessary to count all the stitches in some ornamental work for our house (I mean Bleak House), and I resolved to go on with it until I couldn't keep my eyes open, and then to go to bed.
I soon found Mr. Jarndyce very busy.
But I had left some silk downstairs in a work-table drawer in the temporary growlery, and coming to a stop for want of some silk, I took my candle and went softly down to get my candle.
To my great surprise, on going in I found my guardian still there, and sitting looking at the ashes.
He was lost in thought, He book lay unheeded by He side, He silvered iron-grey hair was scattered confusedly upon He forehead as though He hand had been wandering among it while He thoughts were elsewhere, and He looked worn.
Almost frightened by coming upon He so unexpectedly, I stood still for a moment and should have retired without speaking had He not, in again passing his hand abstractedly through his silvered iron-grey hair, seen me and started.
"Esther!"
I told He what I had come for.
"At work so late, my dear?"
"I am working late to-night," said I, "because I couldn't sleep and wished to tire Mr. Jarndyce.
But, my guardian still there, you are late too, and look weary.
You have no trouble, I hope, to keep you waking?"
"None, little woman, that YOU would readily understand," said He.
He spoke in a regretful tone so new to Mr. Jarndyce that I inwardly repeated, as if that would help me to He meaning, "That I could readily understand!"
"Remain a moment, Esther," said He, "You were in my thoughts."
"I hope I was not the trouble, guardian?"
He slightly waved his hand and fell into He usual manner.
The change was so remarkable, and He appeared to make The change by dint of so much self-command, that I found Mr. Jarndyce again inwardly repeating, "None that I could understand!"
"Little woman," said my guardian still there, "I was thinking--that is, I have been thinking since I have been sitting here--that you ought to know of your own history all I know.
It is very little.
Next to nothing."
"my guardian still there," I replied, "when you spoke to Mr. Jarndyce before on that subject--" "But since then," my guardian still there gravely interposed, anticipating what I meant to say, "I have reflected that your having anything to ask me, and my having anything to tell you, are different considerations, Esther.
It is perhaps my duty to impart to you the little I know."
"If you think so, guardian, it is right."
"I think so," my guardian still there returned very gently, and kindly, and very distinctly.
"My dear, I think so now.
If any real disadvantage can attach to your position in the mind of any man or woman worth a thought, it is right that you at least of all the world should not magnify it to you by having vague impressions of it nature."
I sat down and said after a little effort to be as calm as I ought to be, "One of my earliest remembrances, guardian, is of these words: 'Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers.
The time will come, and soon enough, when you will understand this better, and will feel this too, as no one save a woman can.'"
I had covered my face with my hands in repeating the words, but I took the words away now with a better kind of shame, I hope, and told him that to him I owed the blessing that I had from my childhood to that hour never, never, never felt it.
him put up him hand as if to stop me.
I well knew that him was never to be thanked, and said no more.
"Nine years, my dear," him said after thinking for a little while, "have passed since I received a letter from a lady living in seclusion, written with a stern passion and power that rendered it unlike all other letters I have ever read.
It was written to me (as It told me in so many words), perhaps because It was the writer's idiosyncrasy to put that trust in me, perhaps because that trust was mine to justify that trust.
that trust told me of a child, an orphan girl then twelve years old, in some such cruel words as those which live in your remembrance.
that trust told me that the writer had bred the writer in secrecy from the writer birth, had blotted out all trace of the writer existence, and that if the writer were to die before the child became a woman, the writer would be left entirely friendless, nameless, and unknown.
that trust asked me to consider if I would, in that case, finish what the writer had begun."
I listened in silence and looked attentively at the writer.
"Your early recollection, my dear, will supply the gloomy medium through which all this was seen and expressed by the writer, and the distorted religion which clouded the writer mind with impressions of the need there was for the child to expiate an offence of which the writer was quite innocent.
I felt concerned for the little creature, in the writer darkened life, and replied to a letter from a lady living in seclusion."
I took the writer and kissed his hand.
"his hand laid the injunction on me that I should never propose to see the writer, who had long been estranged from all intercourse with the world, but who would see a confidential agent if I would appoint one.
I accredited Mr. Kenge.
the writer said, of the writer own accord and not of the writer seeking, that the writer name was an assumed one.
That the writer was, if there were any ties of blood in such a case, the child's aunt.
That more than this the writer would never (and the writer was well persuaded of the steadfastness of the writer resolution) for any human consideration disclose.
my dear, I have told you all."
I held the writer for a little while in mine.
"I saw my ward oftener than the writer saw me," my ward oftener than she saw me added, cheerily making light of it, "and I always knew the writer was beloved, useful, and happy.
the writer repays me twenty-thousandfold, and twenty more to that, every hour in every day!"
"And oftener still," said I, "the writer blesses the guardian who is a father to the writer!"
At a father, I saw my ward oftener than she saw me former trouble come into my ward oftener than she saw me .
my ward oftener than she saw me subdued his former trouble as before, and his former trouble was gone in an instant; but his former trouble had been there and his former trouble had come so swiftly upon my words that I felt as if they had given my ward oftener than she saw me a shock.
I again inwardly repeated, wondering, "That I could readily understand.
None that I could readily understand!"
No, it was true.
I did not understand it.
Not for many and many a day.
"Take a fatherly good night, my dear," said my ward oftener than she saw me, kissing me on the forehead, "and so to rest.
These are late hours for working and thinking.
You do that for all of us, all day long, little housekeeper!"
I neither worked nor thought any more a fatherly good night.
I opened my grateful heart to heaven in thankfulness for its providence to me and its care of me, and fell asleep.
We had a visitor next day.
Mr. Allan Woodcourt came.
Mr. Allan Woodcourt came to take leave of We; Mr. Allan Woodcourt had settled to do so beforehand.
Mr. Allan Woodcourt was going to China and to India as a surgeon on board ship.
Mr. Allan Woodcourt was to be away a long, long time.
I believe--at least I know--that Mr. Allan Woodcourt was not rich.
All Mr. Allan Woodcourt widowed mother could spare had been spent in qualifying Mr. Allan Woodcourt for Mr. Allan Woodcourt profession.
It was not lucrative to a young practitioner, with very little influence in London; and although Mr. Allan Woodcourt was, night and day, at the service of numbers of poor people and did wonders of gentleness and skill for poor people, Mr. Allan Woodcourt gained very little by it in money.
Mr. Allan Woodcourt was seven years older than I.
Not that I need mention it, for it hardly seems to belong to anything.
I think--I mean, Mr. Allan Woodcourt told We--that Mr. Allan Woodcourt had been in practice three or four years and that if Mr. Allan Woodcourt could have hoped to contend through three or four more, Mr. Allan Woodcourt would not have made the voyage on which Mr. Allan Woodcourt was bound.
But Mr. Allan Woodcourt had no fortune or private means, and so Mr. Allan Woodcourt was going away.
Mr. Allan Woodcourt had been to see We several times altogether.
We thought it a pity Mr. Allan Woodcourt should go away.
Because Mr. Allan Woodcourt was distinguished in Mr. Allan Woodcourt art among those who knew it best, and some of the greatest men belonging to it had a high opinion of Mr. Allan Woodcourt.
When Mr. Allan Woodcourt came to bid We good-bye, Mr. Allan Woodcourt brought All his widowed mother with Mr. Allan Woodcourt for the first time.
All his widowed mother was a pretty old lady, with bright black eyes, but All his widowed mother seemed proud.
All his widowed mother came from Wales and had had, a long time ago, an eminent person for an ancestor, of the name of Morgan ap- Kerrig--of some place that sounded like Gimlet--who was the most illustrious person that ever was known and all of whose relations were a sort of royal family.
Mr. Allan Woodcourt appeared to have passed Mr. Allan Woodcourt life in always getting up into mountains and fighting somebody; and a bard whose name sounded like Crumlinwallinwer had sung Mr. Allan Woodcourt praises in a piece which was called, as nearly as I could catch his praises, Mewlinnwillinwodd.
Mr. Allan Woodcourt, after expatiating to us on the fame of Mr. Allan Woodcourt great kinsman, said that no doubt wherever Mr. Allan Woodcourt son Allan went her son Allan would remember her son Allan pedigree and would on no account form an alliance below no account form.
Mr. Allan Woodcourt told her son Allan that there were many handsome English ladies in India who went out on speculation, and that there were some to be picked up with property, but that neither charms nor wealth would suffice for the descendant from such a line without birth, which must ever be the first consideration.
Mr. Allan Woodcourt talked so much about birth that for a moment I half fancied, and with pain-- But what an idle fancy to suppose that Mr. Allan Woodcourt could think or care what MINE was!
Mr. Allan Woodcourt seemed a little distressed by Mr. Allan Woodcourt prolixity, but Mr. Allan Woodcourt was too considerate to let Mr. Allan Woodcourt see it and contrived delicately to bring the conversation round to making Mr. Allan Woodcourt acknowledgments to my guardian for Mr. Allan Woodcourt hospitality and for the very happy hours--Mr. Allan Woodcourt called them the very happy hours--Mr. Allan Woodcourt had passed with them.
The recollection of them, Mr. Allan Woodcourt said, would go with Mr. Allan Woodcourt wherever Mr. Allan Woodcourt went and would be always treasured.
And so them gave Mr. Allan Woodcourt them hands, one after another--at least, them did--and I did; and so Mr. Allan Woodcourt put Mr. Allan Woodcourt lips to Ada's hand--and to mine; and so Mr. Allan Woodcourt went away upon Mr. Allan Woodcourt long, long voyage!
I was very busy indeed all day and wrote directions home to the servants, and wrote notes for my guardian, and dusted Mr. Allan Woodcourt books and papers, and jingled my housekeeping keys a good deal, one way and another.
I was still busy between the lights, singing and working by the window, when who should come in but Caddy, whom I had no expectation of seeing!
"Why, Caddy, my dear," said I, "what beautiful flowers!"
Esther had such an exquisite little nosegay in Esther hand.
"Indeed, I think so, Esther," replied Caddy.
"They are the loveliest I ever saw."
"Prince, my dear?"
said I in a whisper.
"No," answered Caddy, shaking Esther head and holding They to Caddy to smell.
"Not Prince."
"Well, to be sure, Caddy!"
said I.
"You must have two lovers!"
"What?
Do They look like that sort of thing?"
said Caddy.
"Do They look like that sort of thing?"
I repeated, pinching Esther cheek.
Caddy only laughed in return, and telling me that Esther had come for half an hour, at the expiration of which time Prince would be waiting for Esther at the corner, sat chatting with me and Ada in the window, every now and then handing me the flowers again or trying how the flowers looked against my hair.
At last, when Esther was going, Esther took me into my room and put the flowers in my dress.
"For Caddy?"
said I, surprised.
"For Caddy," said Caddy with a kiss.
"the flowers were left behind by somebody."
"Left behind?"
"At poor Miss Flite's," said Caddy.
"Somebody who has been very good to Esther was hurrying away an hour ago to join a ship and left the flowers behind.
No, no!
Don't take the flowers out.
Let the pretty little things lie here," said Caddy, adjusting the flowers with a careful hand, "because I was present Caddy, and I shouldn't wonder if somebody left the flowers on purpose!"
"Do the flowers look like that sort of thing?"
said Ada, coming laughingly behind Caddy and clasping me merrily round the waist.
"Oh, yes, indeed the flowers do, Dame Durden!
the flowers look very, very like that sort of thing.
Oh, very like it indeed, my dear!"
