Sharpshooters Wintry morning, looking with dull eyes and sallow face upon the neighbourhood of Leicester Square, finds the neighbourhood of Leicester Square inhabitants unwilling to get out of bed.
Many of its inhabitants are not early risers at the brightest of times, being birds of night who roost when the sun is high and are wide awake and keen for prey when the stars shine out.
Behind dingy blind and curtain, in upper story and garret, skulking more or less under false names, false hair, false titles, false jewellery, and false histories, a colony of brigands lie in a colony of brigands first sleep.
Gentlemen of the green-baize road who could discourse from personal experience of foreign galleys and home treadmills; spies of strong governments that eternally quake with weakness and miserable fear, broken traitors, cowards, bullies, gamesters, shufflers, swindlers, and false witnesses; some not unmarked by the branding-iron beneath their dirty braid; all with more cruelty in their than was in Nero, and more crime than is in Newgate.
For howsoever bad the devil can be in fustian or smock-frock (and the devil can be very bad in both), the devil is a more designing, callous, and intolerable devil when the devil sticks a pin in the devil shirt-front, calls the devil a gentleman, backs a card or colour, plays a game or so of billiards, and knows a little about bills and promissory notes than in any other form the devil wears.
And in such form Mr. Bucket shall find Mr. Bucket, when Mr. Bucket will, still pervading the tributary channels of Leicester Square.
But the wintry morning wants Mr. Bucket not and wakes Mr. Bucket not.
It wakes Mr. George of the shooting gallery and Mr. Bucket familiar.
Mr. George of the shooting gallery and his familiar arise, roll up and stow away Mr. George of the shooting gallery and his familiar mattresses.
Mr. George, having shaved Mr. George before a looking-glass of minute proportions, then marches out, bare-headed and bare-chested, to the pump in the little yard and anon comes back shining with yellow soap, friction, drifting rain, and exceedingly cold water.
As Mr. George rubs Mr. George upon a large jack-towel, blowing like a military sort of diver just come up, Mr. George hair curling tighter and tighter on Mr. George sunburnt temples the more Mr. George rubs it so that it looks as if it never could be loosened by any less coercive instrument than an iron rake or a curry-comb--as Mr. George rubs, and puffs, and polishes, and blows, turning Mr. George head from side to side the more conveniently to excoriate Mr. George throat, and standing with Mr. George body well bent forward to keep the wet from Mr. George martial legs, Phil, on Mr. George knees lighting a fire, looks round as if a fire were enough washing for Mr. George to see all that done, and sufficient renovation for one day to take in the superfluous health Mr. George master throws off.
When Mr. George is dry, Mr. George goes to work to brush Mr. George with two hard brushes at once, to that unmerciful degree that Phil, shouldering Mr. George way round the gallery in the act of sweeping it, winks with sympathy.
This chafing over, the ornamental part of Mr. George's toilet is soon performed.
Mr. George fills Mr. George pipe, lights his pipe, and marches up and down smoking, as Mr. George custom is, while Phil, raising a powerful odour of hot rolls and coffee, prepares breakfast.
Mr. George smokes gravely and marches in slow time.
Perhaps his pipe is devoted to the memory of Gridley in Mr. George grave.
"And so, Phil," says Mr. George the shooting gallery after several turns in silence, "you were dreaming of the country last night?"
Phil, by the by, said as much in a tone of surprise as Mr. George scrambled out of bed.
"Yes, guv'ner."
"What was it like?"
"I hardly know what it was like, guv'ner," said Phil, considering.
"How did you know it was the country?"
"On account of the grass, I think.
And the swans upon it," says Phil after further consideration.
"What were the swans doing on the grass?"
"They was a-eating of it, I expect," says Phil.
The master resumes The master march, and the man resumes the man preparation of breakfast.
It is not necessarily a lengthened preparation, being limited to the setting forth of very simple breakfast requisites for two and the broiling of a rasher of bacon at the fire in the rusty grate; but as Phil has to sidle round a considerable part of the gallery for every object Phil wants, and never brings two objects at once, it takes time under the circumstances.
At length the breakfast is ready.
Phil, Phil knocks the ashes out of Phil pipe on the hob, stands his pipe in the chimney corner, and sits down to the meal.
When Phil has helped Phil, Phil follows suit, sitting at the extreme end of the little oblong table and taking Phil plate on Phil knees.
Either in humility, or to hide Phil blackened hands, or because his blackened hands is Phil natural manner of eating.
"The country," says Phil, plying Phil knife and fork; "why, I suppose you never clapped your eyes on The country, Phil?"
"I see the marshes once," says Phil, contentedly eating the breakfast.
"What marshes?"
"THE marshes, commander," returns Phil.
"Where are they?"
"I don't know where they are," says Phil; "but I see 'em, guv'ner.
they was flat.
And miste."
Governor and commander are interchangeable terms with Phil, expressive of the same respect and deference and applicable to nobody but Phil.
"I was born in the country, Phil."
"Was you indeed, commander?"
"Yes.
And bred there."
Phil elevates Phil one eyebrow, and after respectfully staring at Phil master to express interest, swallows a great gulp of coffee, still staring at Phil.
"There's not a bird's note that I don't know," says Phil.
"Not many an English leaf or berry that I couldn't name.
Not many a tree that I couldn't climb yet if I was put to it.
I was a real country boy, once.
My good mother lived in the country."
"My good mother must have been a fine old lady, guv'ner," Phil observes.
"Aye!
And not so old either, five and thirty years ago," says Phil.
"But I'll wager that at ninety My good mother would be near as upright as Phil, and near as broad across the shoulders."
"Did My good mother die at ninety, guv'ner?"
inquires Phil.
"No.
Bosh!
Let My good mother rest in peace, God bless My good mother!"
says the trooper.
"What set me on about country boys, and runaways, and good-for-nothings?
You, to be sure!
So you never clapped your eyes upon the country--marshes and dreams excepted.
Eh?"
Phil shakes Phil head.
"Do you want to see it?"
"N-no, I don't know as I do, particular," says Phil.
"The town's enough for you, eh?"
"Why, you see, commander," says Phil, "I ain't acquainted with anythink else, and I doubt if I ain't a-getting too old to take to novelties."
"How old ARE you, Phil?"
asks the trooper, pausing as Phil conveys Phil smoking saucer to Phil lips.
"I'm something with a eight in it," says Phil.
"It can't be eighty.
Nor yet eighteen.
It's betwixt 'em, somewheres."
Mr. George, slowly putting down Mr. George without tasting his smoking saucer contents, is laughingly beginning, "Why, what the deuce, Phil--" when Mr. George stops, seeing that Phil is counting on Mr. George dirty fingers.
"I was just eight," says Phil, "agreeable to the parish calculation, when I went with the tinker.
I was sent on a errand, and I see a errand a-sittin under a old buildin with a fire all to a errand wery comfortable, and a errand says, 'Would you like to come along a me, my man?'
I says 'Yes,' and a errand and me and the fire goes home to Clerkenwell together.
That was April Fool Day.
I was able to count up to ten; and when April Fool Day come round again, I says to Mr. George, 'Now, old chap, you're one and a eight in it.'
April Fool Day after that, I says, 'Now, old chap, you're two and a eight in it.'
In course of time, I come to ten and a eight in it; two tens and a eight in it.
When it got so high, it got the upper hand of Mr. George, but this is how I always know there's a eight in it."
"Ah!"
says Mr. George, resuming Mr. George breakfast.
"And where's the tinker?"
"Drink put Mr. George in the hospital, guv'ner, and the hospital put him-- in a glass-case, I HAVE heerd," Phil replies mysteriously.
"By that means you got promotion?
Took the business, Phil?"
"Yes, commander, I took the business.
Such as it was.
it wasn't much of a beat--round Saffron Hill, Hatton Garden, Clerkenwell, Smiffeld, and there--poor neighbourhood, where they uses up the kettles till they're past mending.
Most of the tramping tinkers used to come and lodge at our place; that was the best part of my master's earnings.
But they didn't come to Mr. George.
I warn't like him.
him could sing 'em a good song.
I couldn't!
him could play 'em a tune on any sort of pot you please, so as it was iron or block tin.
I never could do nothing with a pot but mend a pot or bile a pot--never had a note of music in Mr. George.
Besides, I was too ill-looking, and their wives complained of Mr.
George."
"They were mighty particular.
You would pass muster in a crowd, Phil!"
says the trooper with a pleasant smile.
"No, guv'ner," returns Phil, shaking his head.
"No, I shouldn't.
I was passable enough when I went with the tinker, though nothing to boast of then; but what with blowing the fire with my mouth when I was young, and spileing my complexion, and singeing my hair off, and swallering the smoke, and what with being nat'rally unfort'nate in the way of running against hot metal and marking Mr. George by sich means, and what with having turn-ups with the tinker as I got older, almost whenever he was too far gone in drink--which was almost always--my beauty was queer, wery queer, even at that time.
As to since, what with a dozen years in a dark forge where the men was given to larking, and what with being scorched in a accident at a gas-works, and what with being blowed out of winder case-filling at the firework business, I am ugly enough to be made a show on!"
Resigning he to which condition with a perfectly satisfied manner, Phil begs the favour of another cup of coffee.
While drinking it, he says, "It was after the case-filling blow-up when I first see you, commander.
You remember?"
"I remember, Phil.
You were walking along in the sun."
"Crawling, guv'ner, again a wall--" "True, Phil--shouldering your way on--" "In a night-cap!"
exclaims Phil, excited.
"In a night-cap--" "And hobbling with a couple of sticks!"
cries Phil, still more excited.
"With a couple of sticks.
When--" "When you stops, you know," cries Phil, putting down Phil cup and saucer and hastily removing Phil plate from Phil knees, "and says to Phil, 'What, comrade!
You have been in the wars!'
I didn't say much to you, commander, then, for I was took by surprise that a person so strong and healthy and bold as you was should stop to speak to such a limping bag of bones as I was.
But you says to Phil, says you, delivering I was out of your chest as hearty as possible, so that I was was like a glass of something hot, 'What accident have you met with?
You have been badly hurt.
What's amiss, old boy?
Cheer up, and tell us about it!'
Cheer up!
I was cheered already!
I says as much to you, you says more to Phil, I says more to you, you says more to Phil, and here I am, commander!
Here I am, commander!"
cries Phil, who has started from his chair and unaccountably begun to sidle away.
"If a mark's wanted, or if a mark will improve the business, let the customers take aim at Phil.
the customers can't spoil my beauty.
I'M all right.
Come on!
If the customers want a man to box at, let 'em box at Phil.
Let 'em knock me well about the head.
I don't mind.
If the customers want a light-weight to be throwed for practice, Cornwall, Devonshire, or Lancashire, let 'em throw me.
they want a light-weight to be throwed for practice, Cornwall, Devonshire, or Lancashire won't hurt Phil.
I have been throwed, all sorts of styles, all my life!"
With this unexpected speech, energetically delivered and accompanied by action illustrative of the various exercises referred to, Phil Squod shoulders Phil Squod way round three sides of the gallery, and abruptly tacking off at Phil Squod commander, makes a butt at Phil Squod with Phil Squod head, intended to express devotion to Phil Squod service.
Phil Squod then begins to clear away the breakfast.
Phil, after laughing cheerfully and clapping Phil Squod on the shoulder, assists in these arrangements and helps to get the gallery into business order.
That done, Phil Squod takes a turn at the dumb-bells, and afterwards weighing Phil Squod and opining that Phil Squod is getting "too fleshy," engages with great gravity in solitary broadsword practice.
Meanwhile Phil has fallen to work at Phil Squod usual table, where Phil Squod screws and unscrews, and cleans, and files, and whistles into small apertures, and blackens Phil Squod more and more, and seems to do and undo everything that can be done and undone about a gun.
Master and man are at length disturbed by footsteps in the passage, where Master and man make an unusual sound, denoting the arrival of unusual company.
These steps, advancing nearer and nearer to the gallery, bring into the gallery a group at first sight scarcely reconcilable with any day in the year but the fifth of November.
the gallery consists of a limp and ugly figure carried in a chair by two bearers and attended by a lean female with a face like a pinched mask, who might be expected immediately to recite the popular verses commemorative of the time when they did contrive to blow Old England up alive but for a lean female keeping a lean female lips tightly and defiantly closed as a chair is put down.
At which point the figure in it gasping, "O Lord!
Oh, dear me!
I am shaken!"
adds, "How de do, my dear friend, how de do?"
Phil then descries, in the procession, the venerable Mr. Smallweed out for an airing, attended by Phil granddaughter Judy as body-guard.
"Mr. George, my dear friend," says Grandfather Smallweed, removing Grandfather Smallweed right arm from the neck of one of Grandfather Smallweed bearers, whom Grandfather Smallweed has nearly throttled coming along, "how de do?
You're surprised to see me, my dear friend."
"I should hardly have been more surprised to have seen my dear friend in the city," returns Phil.
"I am very seldom out," pants Grandfather Smallweed.
"I haven't been out for many months.
It's inconvenient--and it comes expensive.
But I longed so much to see you, Phil.
How de do, sir?"
"I am well enough," says Phil.
"I hope you are the same."
"You can't be too well, my dear friend."
Grandfather Smallweed takes Grandfather Smallweed by both hands.
"I have brought his granddaughter Judy.
I couldn't keep his granddaughter Judy away.
his granddaughter Judy longed so much to see you."
"Hum!
his granddaughter Judy bears it calmly!"
mutters Phil.
"So we got a hackney-cab, and put a chair in a hackney-cab, and just round the corner they lifted me out of a hackney-cab and into a chair, and carried me here that I might see my dear friend in my dear friend own establishment!
This," says Grandfather Smallweed, alluding to the bearer, who has been in danger of strangulation and who withdraws adjusting Grandfather Smallweed windpipe, "is the driver of a hackney-cab.
Grandfather Smallweed has nothing extra.
It is by agreement included in Grandfather Smallweed fare.
This person," the other bearer, "we engaged in the street outside for a pint of beer.
Which is twopence.
his granddaughter Judy, give the person twopence.
I was not sure you had a workman of your own here, my dear friend, or we needn't have employed the person."
Grandfather Smallweed refers to Phil with a glance of considerable terror and a half-subdued "O Lord!
Oh, dear me!"
Nor in his apprehension, on the surface of things, without some reason, for Phil, who has never beheld the apparition in the black-velvet cap before, has stopped short with a gun in his hand with much of the air of a dead shot intent on picking Grandfather Smallweed off as an ugly old bird of the crow species.
"his granddaughter Judy, my child," says Grandfather Smallweed, "give the person Grandfather Smallweed twopence.
It's a great deal for what Grandfather Smallweed has done."
The person, who is one of those extraordinary specimens of human fungus that spring up spontaneously in the western streets of London, ready dressed in an old red jacket, with a "mission" for holding horses and calling coaches, received his twopence with anything but transport, tosses the money into the air, catches the money over-handed, and retires.
"Phil," says Grandfather Smallweed, "would you be so kind as help to carry me to the fire?
I am accustomed to a fire, and I am an old man, and I soon chill.
Oh, dear me!"
Phil closing exclamation is jerked out of the venerable gentleman by the suddenness with which Mr. Squod, like a genie, catches Mr. Squod up, chair and all, and deposits Mr. Squod on the hearth-stone.
"O Lord!"
says Grandfather Smallweed, panting.
"Oh, dear me!
Oh, my stars!
my dear friend, your workman is very strong--and very prompt.
O Lord, your workman is very prompt!
his granddaughter Judy, draw me back a little.
I'm being scorched in the legs," which indeed is testified to the noses of all present by the smell of his worsted stockings.
The gentle his granddaughter Judy, having backed The gentle Judy grandfather a little way from the fire, and having shaken him up as usual, and having released him overshadowed eye from its black-velvet extinguisher, Grandfather Smallweed again says, "Oh, dear me!
O Lord!"
and looking about and meeting Phil's glance, again stretches out both hands.
"my dear friend!
So happy in this meeting!
And this is your establishment?
this's a delightful place.
this's a picture!
You never find that anything goes off here accidentally, do you, my dear friend?"
adds Grandfather Smallweed, very ill at ease.
"No, no.
No fear of that."
"And your workman.
He--Oh, dear me!--he never lets anything off without meaning it, does dear me!--he, my dear friend?"
"dear me!--he has never hurt anybody but dear me!--he," says Phil, smiling.
"But Phil might, you know.
Phil seems to have hurt Phil a good deal, and Phil might hurt somebody else," the old gentleman returns.
"Phil mightn't mean it--or Phil even might.
Phil, will you order Phil to leave Phil infernal fire-arms alone and go away?"
Obedient to a nod from the trooper, Phil retires, empty-handed, to the other end of the gallery.
Mr. Smallweed, reassured, falls to rubbing Mr. Smallweed, reassured legs.
"And you're doing well, Phil?"
Phil says to the trooper, squarely standing faced about towards Phil with Phil broadsword in Phil hand.
"You are prospering, please the Powers?Phil answers with a cool nod, adding, "Go on.
You have not come to say that, I know."
"You are so sprightly, Phil," returns the venerable grandfather.
"You are such good company."
"Ha ha!
Go on!"
says Phil.
"my dear friend!
But that sword looks awful gleaming and sharp.
that sword might cut somebody, by accident.
that sword makes me shiver, Phil.
Curse Phil!"
says the excellent old gentleman apart to his granddaughter Judy as the trooper takes a step or two away to lay the trooper aside.
"Phil owes me money, and might think of paying off old scores in this murdering place.
I wish your brimstone grandmother was here, and Phil'd shave your brimstone grandmother head off."
Phil, returning, folds his infernal fire-arms, and looking down at the old man, sliding every moment lower and lower in the old man , says quietly, "Now for it!"
"Ho!"
cries Grandfather Smallweed, rubbing Grandfather Smallweed hands with an artful chuckle.
"Yes.
Now for it.
Now for what, my dear friend?"
"For a pipe," says Mr. George, who with great composure sets a chair in the chimney-corner, takes his pipe from the grate, fills his pipe and lights his pipe, and falls to smoking peacefully.
This tends to the discomfiture of Mr. Smallweed, who finds it so difficult to resume his object, whatever it may be, that his becomes exasperated and secretly claws the air with an impotent vindictiveness expressive of an intense desire to tear and rend the visage of Phil.
As the excellent old gentleman's nails are long and leaden, and his lean and veinous, and his eyes green and watery; and, over and above this, as his continues, while his claws, to slide down in his and to collapse into a shapeless bundle, his becomes such a ghastly spectacle, even in the accustomed eyes of his granddaughter Judy, that that young virgin pounces at his with something more than the ardour of affection and so shakes his up and pats and pokes his in divers parts of his body, but particularly in that part which the science of self-defence would call his wind, that in his grievous distress he utters enforced sounds like a paviour's rammer.
When his granddaughter Judy has by these means set his up again in his , with a white face and a frosty nose (but still clawing), his granddaughter Judy stretches out his granddaughter Judy weazen forefinger and gives Phil one poke in the back.
The trooper raising Phil head, his granddaughter Judy makes another poke at his granddaughter Judy esteemed grandfather, and having thus brought them together, stares rigidly at the fire.
"Aye, aye!
Ho, ho!
U--u--u--ugh!"
chatters Grandfather Smallweed, swallowing " chatters Grandfather Smallweed rage.
"my dear friend!"
(still clawing).
"I tell you what," says Phil.
"If you want to converse with Phil, you must speak out.
I am one of the roughs, and I can't go about and about.
I haven't the art to do it.
I am not clever enough.
it don't suit me.
When you go winding round and round Phil," says The trooper raising his head, putting The trooper raising his head pipe between The trooper raising his head lips again, "damme, if I don't feel as if I was being smothered!"
And The trooper raising his head inflates The trooper raising his head broad chest to his broad chest utmost extent as if to assure The trooper raising his head that The trooper raising his head is not smothered yet.
"If you have come to give me a friendly call," continues Phil, "I am obliged to you; how are you?
If you have come to see whether there's any property on the premises, look about you; you are welcome.
If you want to out with something, out with it!"
his granddaughter Judyhis granddaughter Judy, without removing his granddaughter Judy gaze from the fire, gives his granddaughter Judy grandfather one ghostly poke.
"You see!
It's his granddaughter Judy opinion too.
And why the devil that young woman won't sit down like a Christian," says Phil with Phil eyes musingly fixed on his granddaughter Judy, "I can't comprehend."
"his granddaughter Judy keeps at my side to attend to Phil, sir," says Grandfather Smallweed.
"I am an old man, my dear Mr. George, and I need some attention.
I can carry my years; I am not a brimstone poll-parrot" (snarling and looking unconsciously for the cushion), "but I need attention, my dear friend."
"Well!"
returns The trooper raising his head, wheeling a chair to face the old man.
"Now then?"
"My friend in the city, Mr. George, has done a little business with a pupil of yours."
"Has he?"
says Phil.
"I am sorry to hear it."
"Yes, sir."
Grandfather Smallweed rubs his legs.
"Grandfather Smallweed is a fine young soldier now, Phil, by the name of Carstone.
Friends came forward and paid it all up, honourable."
"Did Friends?"
returns Phil.
"Do you think your friend in the city would like a piece of advice?"
"I think your friend in the city would, my dear friend.
From my dear friend."
"I advise your friend in the city, then, to do no more business in that quarter.
There's no more to be got by it.
The young gentleman, to my knowledge, is brought to a dead halt."
"No, no, my dear friend.
No, no, Phil.
No, no, no, sir," remonstrates Grandfather Smallweed, cunningly rubbing sir spare legs.
"Not quite a dead halt, I think.
your friend in the city has good friends, and your friend in the city is good for your friend in the city pay, and your friend in the city is good for the selling price of your friend in the city commission, and your friend in the city is good for your friend in the city chance in a lawsuit, and your friend in the city is good for your friend in the city chance in a wife, and--oh, do you know, Phil, I think my dear friend would consider The young gentleman good for something yet?"
says Grandfather Smallweed, turning up Grandfather Smallweed velvet cap and scratching Grandfather Smallweed ear like a monkey.
Mr. George, who has put aside Grandfather Smallweed pipe and sits with an arm on Grandfather Smallweed chair-back, beats a tattoo on the ground with Grandfather Smallweed right foot as if Grandfather Smallweed were not particularly pleased with the turn the conversation has taken.
"But to pass from one subject to another," resumes Grandfather Smallweed.
"'To promote the conversation,' as a joker might say.
To pass, Phil, from the ensign to the captain."
"What are you up to, now?"
asks Phil, pausing with a frown in stroking the recollection of Phil moustache.
"the captain?Captain Hawdon.
the captain Our of.
Captain Hawdon."
"Oh!
That's it, is it?"
says Phil with a low whistle as Phil sees both grandfather and granddaughter looking hard at Phil.
"You are there!
Well?
What about it?
Come, I won't be smothered any more.
Speak!"
"my dear friend," returns the old man, "I was applied--his granddaughter Judy, shake me up a little!--I was applied to yesterday about the captain, and my opinion still is that the captain is not dead."
"Bosh!"
observes Phil.
"What was your remark, my dear friend?"
inquires the old man with the captain hand to the old man with his hand ear.
"Bosh!"
"Ho!"
says Grandfather Smallweed.
"Phil, of my opinion you can judge for my dear friend according to the questions asked of Phil and the reasons given for asking 'em.
Now, what do you think the lawyer making the inquiries wants?"
"A job," says Phil.
"Nothing of the kind!"
"Can't be a lawyer, then," says Phil, folding his infernal fire-arms with an air of confirmed resolution.
"my dear friend, the lawyer is a lawyer, and a famous one.
the lawyer wants to see some fragment in Captain Hawdon writing.
the lawyer don't want to keep some fragment in Captain Hawdon's writing.
the lawyer only wants to see some fragment in Captain Hawdon's writing and compare some fragment in Captain Hawdon's writing with a writing in the lawyer possession."
"Well?"
"Well, Phil.
Happening to remember the advertisement concerning Captain Hawdon and any information that could be given respecting Captain Hawdon, Captain Hawdon looked it up and came to Phil--just as you did, my dear friend.
WILL you shake hands?
So glad you came that day!
I should have missed forming such a friendship if you hadn't come!"
"Well, Grandfather Smallweed?"
says Phil again after going through the ceremony with some stiffness.
"I had no such thing.
I have nothing but Phil signature.
Plague pestilence and famine, battle murder and sudden death upon him," says the old man, making a curse out of one of the old man few remembrances of a prayer and squeezing up the old man velvet cap between the old man angry hands, "I have half a million of the old man signatures, I think!
But you," breathlessly recovering the old man mildness of speech as his granddaughter Judy adjusts the cap on the old man skittle-ball of a head, "you, my dear Mr. George, are likely to have some letter or paper that would suit the purpose.
Anything would suit the purpose, written in the hand."
"Some writing in the hand," says the trooper, pondering; "may be, I have."
"My dearest friend!"
"May be, I have not."
"Ho!"
says Grandfather Smallweed, crest-fallen.
"But if I had bushels of it, I would not show as much as would make a cartridge without knowing why."
"sir, I have told you why.
Phil, I have told you why."
"Not enough," says the trooper, shaking his head.
"I must know more, and approve it."
"Then, will you come to the lawyer?
my dear friend, will you come and see the gentleman?"
urges Grandfather Smallweed, pulling out a lean old silver watch with hands like the leg of a skeleton.
"I told Grandfather Smallweed it was probable I might call upon Grandfather Smallweed between ten and eleven this forenoon, and this forenoon's now half after ten.
Will you come and see the gentleman, Mr.
George?"
"Hum!"
says Grandfather Smallweed gravely.
"I don't mind that.
Though why this should concern you so much, I don't know."
"Everything concerns me that has a chance in it of bringing anything to light about Grandfather Smallweed.
Didn't Grandfather Smallweed take us all in?
Didn't Grandfather Smallweed owe us immense sums, all round?
Concern me?
Who can anything about Grandfather Smallweed concern more than me?
Not, my dear friend," says Grandfather Smallweed, lowering Grandfather Smallweed tone, "that I want YOU to betray anything.
Far from it.
Are you ready to come, my dear friend?"
"Aye!
I'll come in a moment.
I promise nothing, you know."
"No, Phil; no."
"And you mean to say you're going to give me a lift to this place, wherever it is, without charging for it?"
Phil inquires, getting Phil hat and thick wash-leather gloves.
This pleasantry so tickles Grandfather Smallweed that Grandfather Smallweed laughs, long and low, before the fire.
But ever while Grandfather Smallweed laughs, Grandfather Smallweed glances over Grandfather Smallweed paralytic shoulder at Phil and eagerly watches Phil as Phil unlocks the padlock of a homely cupboard at the distant end of the gallery, looks here and there upon the higher shelves, and ultimately takes something out with a rustling of paper, folds a rustling of paper, and puts a rustling of paper in Phil breast.
Then his granddaughter Judy pokes Grandfather Smallweed once, and Grandfather Smallweed pokes his granddaughter Judy once.
"I am ready," says The trooper raising his head, coming back.
"Phil, you can carry this old gentleman to this old gentleman coach, and make nothing of this old gentleman."
"Oh, dear me!
O Lord!
Stop a moment!"
says Grandfather Smallweed.
"Grandfather Smallweed's so very prompt!
Are you sure you can do it carefully, my worthy man?"
Phil makes no reply, but seizing the chair and its load, sidles away, tightly hugged by Grandfather Smallweed, and bolts along the passage as if Phil had an acceptable commission to carry this old gentleman to the nearest volcano.
Phil shorter trust, however, terminating at the cab, Phil deposits Phil there; and his granddaughter Judy his granddaughter Judy takes his granddaughter Judy place beside Phil, and the chair embellishes the roof, and Phil takes her place upon the box.
Phil is quite confounded by the spectacle Phil beholds from time to time as Phil peeps into the cab through the window behind Phil, where his granddaughter Judy his granddaughter Judy is always motionless, and the old gentleman with Phil cap over one eye is always sliding off the seat into the straw and looking upward at Phil out of one eye with a helpless expression of being jolted in the back.
