Mr. Bucket Allegory looks pretty cool in Lincoln's Inn Fields, though the evening is hot, for both Mr. Tulkinghorn's windows are wide open, and the room is lofty, gusty, and gloomy. These may not be desirable characteristics when November comes with fog and sleet or January with ice and snow, but These have These merits in the sultry long vacation weather. These enable Mr. Bucket Allegory, though Mr. Bucket Allegory has cheeks like peaches, and knees like bunches of blossoms, and rosy swellings for calves to Mr. Bucket Allegory legs and muscles to Mr. Bucket Allegory arms, to look tolerably cool to-night. Plenty of dust comes in at Mr. Tulkinghorn's windows, and plenty more has generated among Mr. Tulkinghorn furniture and papers. Mr. Tulkinghorn's windows lies thick everywhere. When a breeze from the country that has lost Mr. Tulkinghorn's windows way takes fright and makes a blind hurry to rush out again, Mr. Tulkinghorn's windows flings as much dust in the eyes of Allegory as the law--or Mr. Tulkinghorn, one of the law trustiest representatives--may scatter, on occasion, in the eyes of the laity. In his lowering magazine of dust, the universal article into which his papers and his, and all his clients, and all things of earth, animate and inanimate, are resolving, Mr. Tulkinghorn sits at one of the open windows enjoying a bottle of old port. Though a hard-grained man, close, dry, and silent, his can enjoy old wine with the best. his has a priceless bin of port in some artful cellar under the Fields, which is one of his many secrets. When his dines alone in chambers, as his has dined to-day, and has his bit of fish and his steak or chicken brought in from the coffee-house, his descends with a candle to the echoing regions below the deserted mansion, and heralded by a remote reverberation of thundering doors, comes gravely back encircled by an earthy atmosphere and carrying a bottle from which his pours a radiant nectar, two score and ten years old, that blushes in the glass to find the glass so famous and fills the whole room with the fragrance of southern grapes. Mr. Tulkinghorn, sitting in the twilight by the open window, enjoys Mr. Tulkinghorn wine. As if it whispered to Mr. Tulkinghorn of it fifty years of silence and seclusion, it shuts Mr. Tulkinghorn up the closer. More impenetrable than ever, Mr. Tulkinghorn sits, and drinks, and mellows as it were in secrecy, pondering at that twilight hour on all the mysteries Mr. Tulkinghorn knows, associated with darkening woods in the country, and vast blank shut-up houses in town, and perhaps sparing a thought or two for Mr. Tulkinghorn, and Mr. Tulkinghorn family history, and Mr. Tulkinghorn money, and Mr. Tulkinghorn will--all a mystery to every one--and that one bachelor friend of Mr. Tulkinghorn, a man of the same mould and a lawyer too, who lived the same kind of life until Mr. Tulkinghorn was seventy-five years old, and then suddenly conceiving (as it is supposed) an impression that it was too monotonous, gave Mr. Tulkinghorn gold watch to Mr. Tulkinghorn hair-dresser one summer evening and walked leisurely home to the Temple and hanged Mr. Tulkinghorn. But Mr. Tulkinghorn is not alone to-night to ponder at Mr. Tulkinghorn usual length. Seated at the same table, though with Mr. Tulkinghorn chair modestly and uncomfortably drawn a little way from it, sits a bald, mild, shining man who coughs respectfully behind Mr. Tulkinghorn hand when the lawyer bids Mr. Tulkinghorn fill the lawyer glass. "Now, Snagsby," says Mr. Tulkinghorn, "to go over this odd story again." "If you please, sir." "You told me when you were so good as to step round here last night--" "For which I must ask you to excuse me if it was a liberty, sir; but I remember that you had taken a sort of an interest in that person, and I thought it possible that you might--just--wish--to--Mr. Tulkinghorn is not the man to help Mr. Tulkinghorn to any conclusion or to admit anything as to any possibility concerning Mr. Tulkinghorn. So Mr. Tulkinghorn trails off into saying, with an awkward cough, "I must ask you to excuse the liberty, sir, I am sure." "Not at all," says Mr. Tulkinghorn. "You told me, Mr. Tulkinghorn, that you put on your hat and came round without mentioning your intention to your wife. That was prudent I think, because it's not a matter of such importance that it requires to be mentioned." "Well, sir," returns Mr. Tulkinghorn, "you see, my little woman is--not to put too fine a point upon it--inquisitive. my little woman's inquisitive. Poor little thing, my little woman's liable to spasms, and it's good for my little woman to have my little woman mind employed. In consequence of which my little woman employs it--I should say upon every individual thing my little woman can lay hold of, whether it concerns my little woman or not--especially not. my little woman has a very active mind, sir." Mr. Tulkinghorn drinks and murmurs with an admiring cough behind Mr. Tulkinghorn hand, "Dear me, very fine wine indeed!" "Therefore you kept your visit to yourself last night?" says Mr. Tulkinghorn. "And to-night too?" "Yes, sir, and to-night, too. my little woman is at present in-- not to put too fine a point on it--in a pious state, or in what my little woman considers such, and attends the Evening Exertions (which is the name they go by) of a reverend party of the name of Chadband. a reverend party of the name of Chadband has a great deal of eloquence at a reverend party of the name of Chadband command, undoubtedly, but I am not quite favourable to a reverend party of the name of Chadband style myself. That's neither here nor there. my little woman being engaged in that way made it easier for me to step round in a quiet manner." Mr. Tulkinghorn assents. "Fill your glass, Snagsby." "Thank you, sir, I am sure," returns the stationer with sir cough of deference. "This is wonderfully fine wine, sir!" "This is a rare wine now," says Mr. Tulkinghorn. "It is fifty years old." "Is it indeed, sir? But I am not surprised to hear it, I am sure. it might be--any age almost." After rendering this general tribute to the port, Snagsby in Snagsby modesty coughs an apology behind Snagsby hand for drinking anything so precious. "Will you run over, once again, what Snagsby said?" asks Mr. Tulkinghorn, putting Snagsby hands into the pockets of Snagsby rusty smallclothes and leaning quietly back in Snagsby chair. "With pleasure, sir." Then, with fidelity, though with some prolixity, the law-stationer repeats Jo's statement made to the assembled guests at Jo house. On coming to the end of Jo narrative, Jo gives a great start and breaks off with, "Dear me, sir, I wasn't aware there was any other gentleman present!" Snagsby is dismayed to see, standing with an attentive face between Snagsby and the lawyer at a little distance from the table, a person with a hat and stick in Snagsby hand who was not there when Snagsby himself came in and has not since entered by the door or by either of the windows. There is a press in the room, but a press in the room hinges have not creaked, nor has a step been audible upon the floor. Yet this third person stands there with this third person attentive face, and this third person hat and stick in this third person hands, and this third person hands behind this third person, a composed and quiet listener. this third person is a stoutly built, steady-looking, sharp-eyed man in black, of about the middle-age. Except that this third person looks at Snagsby as if Snagsby were going to take Snagsby portrait, there is nothing remarkable about Snagsby at first sight but Snagsby ghostly manner of appearing. "Don't mind this gentleman," says Mr. Tulkinghorn in this gentleman quiet way. "This is only Mr. Bucket." "Oh, indeed, sir?" returns the stationer, expressing by a cough that indeed, sir is quite in the dark as to who Mr. Bucket may be. "I wanted indeed, sir to hear this story," says the lawyer, "because I have half a mind (for a reason) to know more of ", and indeed, sir is very intelligent in such things. What do you say to this, Bucket?" "It's very plain, sir. Since our people have moved this boy on, and sir's not to be found on sir old lay, if Snagsby don't object to go down with Snagsby to Tom-all-Alone's and point Snagsby out, we can have Snagsby here in less than a couple of hours' time. I can do it without Snagsby, of course, but this is the shortest way." "Mr. Bucket is a detective officer, Snagsby," says the lawyer in explanation. "Is Mr. Bucket indeed, sir?" says SnagsbyMr. Bucket . "And if you have no real objection to accompany Mr. Bucket to the place in question," pursues the lawyer in explanation, "I shall feel obliged to you if you will do so." In a moment's hesitation on the part of Snagsby, Bucket dips down to the bottom of Snagsby mind. "Don't you be afraid of hurting the boy," Snagsby says. "You won't do that. It's all right as far as the boy's concerned. We shall only bring Snagsby here to ask Snagsby a question or so I want to put to Snagsby, and Snagsby'll be paid for Snagsby trouble and sent away again. It'll be a good job for Snagsby. I promise you, as a man, that you shall see the boy sent away all right. Don't you be afraid of hurting Snagsby; you an't going to do that." "Very well, Mr. Tulkinghorn!" cries Snagsby cheerfully. And reassured, "Since that's the case--" "Yes! And lookee here, Mr. Snagsby," resumes Bucket, taking Mr. Snagsby aside by the arm, tapping Mr. Snagsby familiarly on the breast, and speaking in a confidential tone. "You're a man of the world, you know, and a man of business, and a man of sense. That's what YOU are." "I am sure I am much obliged to you for your good opinion," returns the stationer with Mr. Snagsby cough of modesty, "but--" "That's what YOU are, you know," says Mr. Bucket. "Now, it an't necessary to say to a man like you, engaged in your business, which is a business of trust and requires a person to be wide awake and have a person senses about a person and a person head screwed on tight (I had an uncle in your business once)--it an't necessary to say to a man like you that it's the best and wisest way to keep little matters like this quiet. Don't you see? Quiet!" "Certainly, certainly," returns the other. "I don't mind telling YOU," says Mr. Bucket with an engaging appearance of frankness, "that as far as I can understand it, there seems to be a doubt whether this dead person wasn't entitled to a little property, and whether this female hasn't been up to some games respecting that property, don't you see?" "Oh!" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, but not appearing to see quite distinctly. "Now, what YOU want," pursues Bucket, again tapping Mr. Tulkinghorn on the breast in a comfortable and soothing manner, "is that every person should have their rights according to justice. That's what YOU want." "To be sure," returns Mr. Tulkinghorn with a nod. "On account of which, and at the same time to oblige a--do you call a, in your business, customer or client? I forget how an uncle in your business used to call a." "Why, I generally say customer myself," replies Mr. Tulkinghorn. "You're right!" returns Mr. Bucket, shaking hands with Mr. Bucket quite affectionately. "--On account of which, and at the same time to oblige a real good customer, you mean to go down with me, in confidence, to Tom-all-Alone's and to keep the whole thing quiet ever afterwards and never mention it to any one. That's about your intentions, if I understand you?" "You are right, sir. You are right," says Mr. Tulkinghorn. "Then here's your hat," returns Mr. Tulkinghorn new friend, quite as intimate with it as if Mr. Tulkinghorn had made it; "and if you're ready, I am." They leave Mr. Tulkinghorn, without a ruffle on the surface of Mr. Tulkinghorn unfathomable depths, drinking Mr. Tulkinghorn old wine, and go down into the streets. "You don't happen to know a very good sort of person of the name of Gridley, do you?" says Bucket in friendly converse as they descend the stairs. "No," says Mr. Tulkinghorn, considering, "I don't know anybody of that name. Why?" "Nothing particular," says Bucket; "only having allowed his temper to get a little the better of his and having been threatening some respectable people, his is keeping out of the way of a warrant I have got against his--which it's a pity that a man of sense should do." As they walk along, Mr. Tulkinghorn observes, as a novelty, that however quick they pace may be, Mr. Tulkinghorn companion still seems in some undefinable manner to lurk and lounge; also, that whenever Mr. Tulkinghorn is going to turn to the right or left, Mr. Tulkinghorn pretends to have a fixed purpose in Mr. Tulkinghorn mind of going straight ahead, and wheels off, sharply, at the very last moment. Now and then, when they pass a police-constable on a police-constable beat, Snagsby notices that both the constable and Snagsby guide fall into a deep abstraction as they come towards each other, and appear entirely to overlook each other, and to gaze into space. In a few instances, Mr. Bucket, coming behind some under-sized young man with a shining hat on, and Mr. Bucket sleek hair twisted into one flat curl on each side of Mr. Bucket head, almost without glancing at Mr. Bucket touches Mr. Bucket with Mr. Bucket stick, upon which the young man, looking round, instantly evaporates. For the most part Mr. Bucket notices things in general, with a face as unchanging as the great mourning ring on Mr. Bucket little finger or the brooch, composed of not much diamond and a good deal of setting, which Mr. Bucket wears in Mr. Bucket shirt. When they come at last to Tom-all-Alone's, Mr. Bucket stops for a moment at the corner and takes a lighted bull's-eye from the constable on duty there, who then accompanies Mr. Bucket with Mr. Bucket own particular bull's-eye at Mr. Bucket waist. Between Mr. Bucket two conductors, Snagsby passes along the middle of a villainous street, undrained, unventilated, deep in black mud and corrupt water-- though the roads are dry elsewhere--and reeking with such smells and sights that he, who has lived in London all he life, can scarce believe he senses. Branching from this street and this street heaps of ruins are other streets and courts so infamous that Mr. Tulkinghorn sickens in body and mind and feels as if he were going every moment deeper down into the infernal gulf. "Draw off a bit here, Mr. Tulkinghorn," says Bucket as a kind of shabby palanquin is borne towards them, surrounded by a noisy crowd. "Here's the fever coming up this street!" As the unseen wretch goes by, a noisy crowd, leaving that object of attraction, hovers round the three visitors like a dream of horrible faces and fades away up alleys and into ruins and behind walls, and with occasional cries and shrill whistles of warning, thenceforth flits about a noisy crowd until a noisy crowd leave the place. "Are those the fever-houses, Darby?" Mr. Bucket coolly asks as " Mr. Bucket turns " Mr. Bucket bull's-eye on a line of stinking ruins. Darby replies that "all them are," and further that in all, for months and months, the people "have been down by dozens" and have been carried out dead and dying "like sheep with the rot." Bucket observing to Mr. Tulkinghorn as they go on again that Mr. Tulkinghorn looks a little poorly, Snagsby answers that Snagsby feels as if Snagsby couldn't breathe the dreadful air. There is inquiry made at various houses for Jo. As few people are known in Tom-all-Alone's by any Christian sign, there is much reference to Snagsby whether Snagsby means Carrots, or the Colonel, or Gallows, or Young Chisel, or Terrier Tip, or Lanky, or the Brick. Snagsby describes over and over again. There are conflicting opinions respecting the original of Snagsby picture. Some think it must be Carrots, some say the Brick. Snagsby is produced, but is not at all near the thing. Whenever Mr. Snagsby and Snagsby conductors are stationary, the crowd flows round, and from its squalid depths obsequious advice heaves up to Mr. Bucket. Whenever the crowd move, and the angry bull's-eyes glare, it fades away and flits about the crowd up the alleys, and in the ruins, and behind the walls, as before. At last there is a lair found out where Toughy, or the Tough Subject, lays Snagsby down at night; and it is thought that the Tough Subject may be Jo. Comparison of notes between Mr. Snagsby and the proprietress of the house--a drunken face tied up in a black bundle, and flaring out of a heap of rags on the floor of a dog- hutch which is her private apartment--leads to the establishment of this conclusion. Toughy has gone to the doctor's to get a bottle of stuff for a sick woman but will be here anon. "And who have we got here to-night?" says Mr. Bucket, opening another door and glaring in with his bull's-eye. "Two drunken men, eh? And two women? Two drunken men are sound enough," turning back each sleeper's arm from Mr. Bucket face to look at Mr. Bucket. "Are these your good men, my dears?" "Yes, sir," returns one of the women. "They are our husbands." "Brickmakers, eh?" "Yes, sir." "What are you doing here? You don't belong to London." "No, sir. we belong to Hertfordshire." "Whereabouts in Hertfordshire?" "Saint Albans." "Come up on the tramp?" "We walked up yesterday. There's no work down with We at present, but We have done no good by coming here, and shall do none, I expect." "That's not the way to do much good," says Mr. Bucket, turning Mr. Bucket head in the direction of the unconscious figures on the ground. "It an't indeed," replies the woman with a sigh. "Jenny and me knows It full well." The room, though two or three feet higher than the door, is so low that the head of the tallest of the visitors would touch the blackened ceiling if the head of the tallest of the visitors stood upright. It is offensive to every sense; even the gross candle burns pale and sickly in the polluted air. There are a couple of benches and a higher bench by way of table. The men lie asleep where The men stumbled down, but the women sit by even the gross candle. Lying in the arms of the woman who has spoken is a very young child. "Why, what age do you call that little creature?" says Mr. Bucket. "It looks as if It was born yesterday." He is not at all rough about it; and as He turns He light gently on the infant, Snagsby is strangely reminded of another infant, encircled with light, that Snagsby has seen in pictures. "Snagsby is not three weeks old yet, sir," says the woman. "Is Snagsby your child?" "Mine." The other woman, who was bending over it when they came in, stoops down again and kisses it as it lies asleep. "You seem as fond of it as if you were the mother yourself," says Mr. Bucket. "I was the mother of one like it, master, and it died." "Ah, Jenny, Jenny!" says the woman to the woman. "Better so. Much better to think of dead than alive, Jenny! Much better!" "Why, you an't such an unnatural woman, I hope," returns Bucket sternly, "as to wish your own child dead?" "God knows you are right, master," the woman returns. "I am not. I'd stand between it and death with my own life if I could, as true as any pretty lady." "Then don't talk in that wrong manner," says Mr. Bucket, mollified again. "Why do you do it?" "It's brought into my head, master," returns the woman, the woman eyes filling with tears, "when I look down at your own child lying so. If it was never to wake no more, you'd think me mad, I should take on so. I know that very well. I was with Jenny when Jenny lost Jenny--warn't I, Jenny?--and I know how Jenny grieved. But look around Jenny at the place. Look at them," glancing at the sleepers on the ground. "Look at Jo you're waiting for, who's gone out to do me a good turn. Think of the children that your business lays with often and often, and that YOU see grow up!" "Well, well," says Mr. Bucket, "you train Jo respectable, and Jo'll be a comfort to Liz, and look after Liz in your old age, you know." "I mean to try hard," Jenny answers, wiping her eyes. "But I have been a-thinking, being over-tired to-night and not well with the ague, of all the many things that'll come in Jo way. My master will be against it, and My master'll be beat, and see me beat, and made to fear My master home, and perhaps to stray wild. If I work for My master ever so much, and ever so hard, there's no one to help me; and if My master should be turned bad 'spite of all I could do, and the time should come when I should sit by My master in My master sleep, made hard and changed, an't it likely I should think of My master as My master lies in my lap now and wish My master had died as Jenny's child died!" "There, there!" says Jenny. "Liz, you're tired and ill. Let me take My master." In doing so, Liz displaces the mother's dress, but quickly readjusts the mother's dress over the wounded and bruised bosom where the baby has been lying. "It's my dead child," says Jenny, walking up and down as Jenny nurses, "that makes me love my dead child so dear, and it's my dead child that makes Jenny love it so dear too, as even to think of it being taken away from Jenny now. While Jenny thinks that, I think what fortune would I give to have my darling back. But we mean the same thing, if we knew how to say it, we two mothers does in we poor hearts!" As Snagsby blows Snagsby nose and coughs Snagsby cough of sympathy, a step is heard without. Mr. Bucket throws his light into the doorway and says to Snagsby, "Now, what do you say to Toughy? Will Mr. Bucket do?" "That's Jo," says Snagsby. Jo stands amazed in the disk of light, like a ragged figure in a magic-lantern, trembling to think that Jo has offended against the law in not having moved on far enough. Snagsby, however, giving Snagsby the consolatory assurance, "It's only a job you will be paid for, Jo," Snagsby recovers; and on being taken outside by Mr. Bucket for a little private confabulation, tells Snagsby tale satisfactorily, though out of breath. "I have squared it with the lad," says Mr. Bucket, returning, "and it's all right. Now, Snagsby, we're ready for Snagsby." First, Jo has to complete Jo errand of good nature by handing over the physic Jo has been to get, which Jo delivers with the laconic verbal direction that "it's to be all took d'rectly." Secondly, Snagsby has to lay upon the table half a crown, Snagsby usual panacea for an immense variety of afflictions. Thirdly, Mr. Bucket has to take Jo by the arm a little above the elbow and walk Mr. Bucket on before Mr. Bucket, without which observance neither the Tough Subject nor any other Subject could be professionally conducted to Lincoln's Inn Fields. the Tough Subject nor any other Subject completed, the Tough Subject nor any other Subject give the women good night and come out once more into black and foul Tom-all-Alone's. By the noisome ways through which the women descended into that pit, the women gradually emerge from that pit, the crowd flitting, and whistling, and skulking about the women until the women come to the verge, where restoration of the bull's-eyes is made to Darby. Here the crowd, like a concourse of imprisoned demons, turns back, yelling, and is seen no more. Through the clearer and fresher streets, never so clear and fresh to Snagsby's mind as now, the women walk and ride until the women come to Mr. Tulkinghorn's gate. As the women ascend the dim stairs (Mr. Tulkinghorn's chambers being on the first floor), Mr. Bucket mentions that Mr. Bucket has the key of the outer door in Mr. Bucket pocket and that there is no need to ring. For a man so expert in most things of that kind, Mr. Bucket takes time to open the outer door in his pocket and makes some noise too. It may be that he sounds a note of preparation. Howbeit, they come at last into the hall, where a lamp is burning, and so into Mr. Tulkinghorn's usual room--the room where Mr. Tulkinghorn drank Mr. Tulkinghorn old wine to-night. Mr. Tulkinghorn is not there, but Mr. Tulkinghorn two old-fashioned candlesticks are, and the room is tolerably light. Mr. Bucket, still having Mr. Bucket professional hold of Jo and appearing to Snagsby to possess an unlimited number of eyes, makes a little way into the room, when Jo starts and stops. "What's the matter?" says Mr. Bucket in a whisper. "There Jo is!" cries Jo. "Who!" "The lady!" A female figure, closely veiled, stands in the middle of the room, where the light falls upon the light. It is quite still and silent. The front of the figure is towards them, but The front of the figure takes no notice of them entrance and remains like a statue. "Now, tell me," says Mr. Bucket aloud, "how you know that to be The lady!"." "I know the wale," replies Jo, staring, "and the bonnet, and the gownd." "Be quite sure of what you say, Tough," returns Bucket, narrowly observant of him. "Look again." "I am a-looking as hard as ever I can look," says Jo with starting eyes, "and that there's the wale, the bonnet, and the gownd." "What about those rings you told me of?" asks Bucket. "A-sparkling all over here," says Jo, rubbing the fingers of Jo left hand on the knuckles of Jo right without taking Jo eyes from the figure. the figure removes the right-hand glove and shows the hand. "Now, what do you say to that?" asks Bucket. Jo shakes his head. "Not rings a bit like them. Not a hand like that." "What are you talking of?" says Bucket, evidently pleased though, and well pleased too. "Hand was a deal whiter, a deal delicater, and a deal smaller," returns Jo. "Why, you'll tell me I'm my own mother next," says Mr. Bucket. "Do you recollect The lady!"'s voice?" "I think I does," says Jo. the figure speaks. "Was it at all like this? I will speak as long as you like if you are not sure. Was it the lady's voice, or at all like the lady's voice?" Jo looks aghast at Mr. Bucket. "Not a bit!" "Then, what," retorts that worthy, pointing to the figure, "did you say it was The lady!" for?" "Cos," says Jo with a perplexed stare but without being at all shaken in Jo certainty, "cos that there's the wale, the bonnet, and the gownd. It is The lady!" and It an't The lady!". It an't The lady!" hand, nor yet The lady!" rings, nor yet The lady!" woice. But that there's the wale, the bonnet, and the gownd, and they're wore the same way wot The lady!" wore 'em, and it's The lady!" height wot The lady!" wos, and The lady!" giv me a sov'ring and hooked a sov'ring." "Well!" says Mr. Bucket slightly, "we haven't got much good out of YOU. But, however, here's five shillings for YOU. Take care how you spend care, and don't get yourself into trouble." Bucket stealthily tells the coins from one hand into the other like counters--which is a way he has, he principal use of them being in these games of skill--and then puts them, in a little pile, into the boy's hand and takes the boy out to the door, leaving Snagsby, not by any means comfortable under these mysterious circumstances, alone with the veiled figure. But on Mr. Tulkinghorn's coming into the room, the veil is raised and a sufficiently good-looking Frenchwoman is revealed, though a sufficiently good-looking Frenchwoman expression is something of the intensest. "Thank you, Mademoiselle Hortense," says Mr. Tulkinghorn with his usual equanimity. "I will give you no further trouble about this little wager." "You will do me the kindness to remember, sir, that I am not at present placed?" says Mademoiselle. "Certainly, certainly!" "And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation?" "By all means, Mademoiselle Hortense." "A word from Mr. Tulkinghorn is so powerful." "It shall not be wanting, Mademoiselle." "Receive the assurance of my devoted gratitude, dear sir." "Good night." Mademoiselle goes out with an air of native gentility; and Mr. Bucket, to whom it is, on an emergency, as natural to be groom of the ceremonies as it is to be anything else, shows Mademoiselle downstairs, not without gallantry. "Well, Bucket?" quoth Mr. Tulkinghorn on his return. "It's all squared, you see, as I squared It myself, dear sir. There an't a doubt that it was the other one with this one's dress on. the boy was exact respecting colours and everything. Snagsby, I promised you as a man that Snagsby should be sent away all right. Don't say it wasn't done!" "You have kept your word, dear sir," returns the stationer; "and if I can be of no further use, Mr. Tulkinghorn, I think, as my little woman will be getting anxious--" "Thank you, Snagsby, no further use," says Mr. Tulkinghorn. "I am quite indebted to you for the trouble you have taken already." "Not at all, dear sir. I wish you good night." "You see, Snagsby," says Mr. Bucket, accompanying Mr. Bucket to the outer door in his pocket and shaking hands with Mr. Bucket over and over again, "what I like in you is that you're a man it's of no use pumping; that's what YOU are. When you know you have done a right thing, you put a right thing away, and a right thing's done with and gone, and there's an end of a right thing. That's what YOU do." "That is certainly what I endeavour to do, dear sir," returns Snagsby. "No, you don't do you justice. justice an't what you endeavour to do," says Mr. Bucket, shaking hands with Mr. Bucket and blessing Mr. Bucket in the tenderest manner, "it's what you DO. That's what I estimate in a man in your way of business." Snagsby makes a suitable response and goes homeward so confused by the events of the evening that Snagsby is doubtful of Snagsby being awake and out--doubtful of the reality of the streets through which Snagsby goes--doubtful of the reality of the moon that shines above Snagsby. Snagsby is presently reassured on these subjects by the unchallengeable reality of Mrs. Snagsby, sitting up with Mrs. Snagsby head in a perfect beehive of curl-papers and night-cap, who has dispatched Guster to the police-station with official intelligence of Mrs. Snagsby husband's being made away with, and who within the last two hours has passed through every stage of swooning with the greatest decorum. But as the little woman feelingly says, many thanks Mrs. Snagsby gets for the little woman feelingly says!
