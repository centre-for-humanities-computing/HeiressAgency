A Discovery The days when I frequented that miserable corner which my dear girl brightened can never fade in my remembrance. I never see it, and I never wish to see it now; I have been there only once since, but in my memory there is a mournful glory shining on the place which will shine for ever. Not a day passed without my going there, of course. At first I found Mr. Skimpole there, on two or three occasions, idly playing the piano and talking in Mr. Skimpole there usual vivacious strain. Now, besides my very much mistrusting the probability of Mr. Skimpole there being there without making Mr. Skimpole there poorer, I felt as if there were something in Mr. Skimpole there careless gaiety too inconsistent with what I knew of the depths of Ada's life. I clearly perceived, too, that Ada shared my feelings. I therefore resolved, after much thinking of it, to make a private visit to Mr. Skimpole there and try delicately to explain Mr. Skimpole there. my dear girl was the great consideration that made me bold. I set off one morning, accompanied by Charley, for Somers Town. As I approached the house, I was strongly inclined to turn back, for I felt what a desperate attempt the house was to make an impression on Mr. Skimpole there and how extremely likely it was that Mr. Skimpole there would signally defeat me. However, I thought that being there, I would go through with it. I knocked with a trembling hand at Mr. Skimpole there's door-- literally with a hand, for the knocker was gone--and after a long parley gained admission from an Irishwoman, who was in the area when I knocked, breaking up the lid of a water-butt with a poker to light the fire with. Mr. Skimpole there, lying on the sofa in Mr. Skimpole there room, playing the flute a little, was enchanted to see me. Now, who should receive me, Mr. Skimpole there asked. Who would I prefer for mistress of the ceremonies? Would I have Mr. Skimpole there Comedy daughter, Mr. Skimpole there Beauty daughter, or Mr. Skimpole there Sentiment daughter? Or would I have all the daughters at once in a perfect nosegay? I replied, half defeated already, that I wished to speak to Mr. Skimpole there only if Mr. Skimpole there would give me leave. "My dear Miss Summerson, most joyfully! Of course," Mr. Skimpole there said, bringing Mr. Skimpole there chair nearer mine and breaking into Mr. Skimpole there fascinating smile, "of course it's not business. Then it's pleasure!" I said it certainly was not business that I came upon, but it was not quite a pleasant matter. "Then, my dear Miss Summerson," said my dear Miss Summerson with the frankest gaiety, "don't allude to it. Why should you allude to anything that is NOT a pleasant matter? I never do. And you are a much pleasanter creature, in every point of view, than I. You are perfectly pleasant; I am imperfectly pleasant; then, if I never allude to an unpleasant matter, how much less should you! So that's disposed of, and we will talk of something else." Although I was embarrassed, I took courage to intimate that I still wished to pursue the subject. "I should think the subject a mistake," said Mr. Skimpole with Mr. Skimpole airy laugh, "if I thought Miss Summerson capable of making one. But I don't!" "Mr. Skimpole," said I, raising my eyes to Mr. Skimpole, "I have so often heard you say that you are unacquainted with the common affairs of life--" "Meaning our three banking-house friends, L, S, and who's the junior partner? D?" said Mr. Skimpole, brightly. "Not an idea of them!" "--That perhaps," I went on, "you will excuse my boldness on that account. I think you ought most seriously to know that Richard is poorer than Richard was." "Dear me!" said Mr. Skimpole. "So am I, they tell me." "And in very embarrassed circumstances." "Parallel case, exactly!" said Mr. Skimpole with a delighted countenance. "This at present naturally causes Ada much secret anxiety, and as I think Ada is less anxious when no claims are made upon Ada by visitors, and as Richard has one uneasiness always heavy on Richard mind, it has occurred to ME to take the liberty of saying that--if you would--not--" I was coming to the point with great difficulty when Richard took me by both hands and with a radiant face and in the liveliest way anticipated it. "Not go there? Certainly not, my dear Miss Summerson, most assuredly not. Why SHOULD I go there? When I go anywhere, I go for pleasure. I don't go anywhere for Pain, because I was made for pleasure. Pain comes to ME when it wants me. Now, I have had very little pleasure at our dear Richard's lately, and your practical sagacity demonstrates why. our young friends, losing the youthful poetry which was once so captivating in them, begin to think, 'This is a man who wants pounds.' So I am; I always want pounds; not for ME, but because tradespeople always want them of ME. Next, our young friends begin to think, becoming mercenary, 'This is the man who HAD pounds, who borrowed our young friends,' which I did. I always borrow pounds. So our young friends, reduced to prose (which is much to be regretted), degenerate in our young friends power of imparting pleasure to ME. Why should I go to see our young friends, therefore? Absurd!" Through the beaming smile with which he regarded me as he reasoned thus, there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite astonishing. "Besides," he said, pursuing he argument in he tone of light- hearted conviction, "if I don't go anywhere for pain--which would be a perversion of the intention of my being, and a monstrous thing to do--why should I go anywhere to be the cause of pain? If I went to see our young friends in our young friends present ill-regulated state of mind, I should give our young friends pain. The associations with ME would be disagreeable. The associations with me might say, 'This is the man who had pounds and who can't pay pounds,' which I can't, of course; nothing could be more out of the question! Then kindness requires that I shouldn't go near kindness--and I won't." he finished by genially kissing my hand and thanking me. Nothing but Miss Summerson's fine tact, he said, would have found this out for he. I was much disconcerted, but I reflected that if the main point were gained, it mattered little how strangely he perverted everything leading to this. I had determined to mention something else, however, and I thought I was not to be put off in that. "Mr. Skimpole," said I, "I must take the liberty of saying before I conclude my visit that I was much surprised to learn, on the best authority, some little time ago, that you knew with whom that poor boy left Bleak House and that you accepted a present on that occasion. I have not mentioned it to my guardian, for I fear it would hurt my guardian unnecessarily; but I may say to you that I was much surprised." "No? Really surprised, my dear Miss Summerson?" my guardian returned inquiringly, raising my guardian pleasant eyebrows. "Greatly surprised." my guardian thought about it for a little while with a highly agreeable and whimsical expression of face, then quite gave it up and said in my guardian most engaging manner, "You know what a child I am. Why surprised?" I was reluctant to enter minutely into that question, but as my guardian begged I would, for my guardian was really curious to know, I gave my guardian to understand in the gentlest words I could use that my guardian conduct seemed to involve a disregard of several moral obligations. my guardian was much amused and interested when my guardian heard this and said, "No, really?" with ingenuous simplicity. "You know I don't intend to be responsible. I never could do this. Responsibility is a thing that has always been above me--or below me," said Mr. Skimpole. "I don't even know which; but as I understand the way in which my dear Miss Summerson (always remarkable for her practical good sense and clearness) puts this case, I should imagine this case was chiefly a question of money, do you know?" I incautiously gave a qualified assent to this. "Ah! Then you see," said Mr. Skimpole, shaking Mr. Skimpole head, "I am hopeless of understanding his head." I suggested, as I rose to go, that his head was not right to betray my guardian's confidence for a bribe. "My dear Miss Summerson," My dear Miss Summerson returned with a candid hilarity that was all My dear Miss Summerson own, "I can't be bribed." "Not by Mr. Bucket?" said I. "No," said My dear Miss Summerson. "Not by anybody. I don't attach any value to money. I don't care about it, I don't know about it, I don't want it, I don't keep it--it goes away from me directly. How can I be bribed?" I showed that I was of a different opinion, though I had not the capacity for arguing the question. "On the contrary," said Mr. Skimpole, "I am exactly the man to be placed in a superior position in such a case as that. I am above the rest of mankind in such a case as that. I can act with philosophy in such a case as that. I am not warped by prejudices, as an Italian baby is by bandages. I am as free as the air. I feel me as far above suspicion as Caesar's wife." Anything to equal the lightness of his manner and the playful impartiality with which his seemed to convince his, as his tossed the matter about like a ball of feathers, was surely never seen in anybody else! "Observe the case, my dear Miss Summerson. Here is a boy received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to. a boy received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object being in bed, a man arrives--like the house. Here is the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to. Here is a bank-note produced by the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to. Here is the Skimpole who accepts the bank-note produced by the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to. Those are the facts. Very well. Should Mr. Skimpole there have refused the note? WHY should Mr. Skimpole there Mr. Skimpole there have refused the note? Skimpole protests to Bucket, 'What's this for? I don't understand it, it is of no use to me, take it away.' Bucket still entreats Mr. Skimpole there to accept it. Are there reasons why Mr. Skimpole there, not being warped by prejudices, should accept it? Yes. Mr. Skimpole there perceives them. What are them? Mr. Skimpole there reasons with Mr. Skimpole there, this is a tamed lynx, an active police-officer, an intelligent man, a person of a peculiarly directed energy and great subtlety both of conception and execution, who discovers our friends and enemies for our when our friends and enemies run away, recovers our property for our when our are robbed, avenges our comfortably when our are murdered. This active police-officer and intelligent man has acquired, in the exercise of This active police-officer and intelligent man art, a strong faith in money; This active police-officer and intelligent man finds it very useful to This active police-officer and intelligent man, and This active police-officer and intelligent man makes it very useful to society. Shall I shake a strong faith in money because I want a strong faith in money myself; shall I deliberately blunt one of Bucket's weapons; shall I positively paralyse Bucket in This active police-officer and intelligent man next detective operation? And again. If it is blameable in Mr. Skimpole there to take the note, it is blameable in Bucket to offer the note--much more blameable in Bucket, because he is the knowing man. Now, Mr. Skimpole there wishes to think well of Bucket; Mr. Skimpole there deems Mr. Skimpole there essential, in Mr. Skimpole there little place, to the general cohesion of things, that Mr. Skimpole there SHOULD think well of Bucket. The state expressly asks Mr. Skimpole there to trust to Bucket. And Mr. Skimpole there does. And that's all Mr. Skimpole there does!" I had nothing to offer in reply to this exposition and therefore took my leave. Mr. Skimpole, however, who was in excellent spirits, would not hear of my returning home attended only by "Little Coavinses," and accompanied me Mr. Skimpole. Mr. Skimpole entertained me on the way with a variety of delightful conversation and assured me, at parting, that Mr. Skimpole should never forget the fine tact with which I had found that out for Mr. Skimpole about our young friends. As it so happened that I never saw Mr. Skimpole again, I may at once finish what I know of Mr. Skimpole history. A coolness arose between Mr. Skimpole and my guardian, based principally on the foregoing grounds and on Mr. Skimpole having heartlessly disregarded my guardian's entreaties (as we afterwards learned from Ada) in reference to Richard. Mr. Skimpole being heavily in my guardian's debt had nothing to do with their separation. Mr. Skimpole died some five years afterwards and left a diary behind Mr. Skimpole, with letters and other materials towards Mr. Skimpole life, which was published and which showed Mr. Skimpole to have been the victim of a combination on the part of mankind against an amiable child. It was considered very pleasant reading, but I never read more of It myself than the sentence on which I chanced to light on opening the book. It was this: "Jarndyce, in common with most other men I have known, is the incarnation of selfishness." And now I come to a part of my story touching myself very nearly indeed, and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance occurred. Whatever little lingerings may have now and then revived in my mind associated with my poor old face had only revived as belonging to a part of my life that was gone--gone like my infancy or my childhood. I have suppressed none of my many weaknesses on that subject, but have written my many weaknesses as faithfully as my memory has recalled my many weaknesses. And I hope to do, and mean to do, the same down to the last words of these pages, which I see now not so very far before me. The months were gliding away, and my dear girl, sustained by the hopes she had confided in myself, was the same beautiful star in the miserable corner. Richard, more worn and haggard, haunted the court day after day, listlessly sat there the whole day long when Richard knew there was no remote chance of the suit being mentioned, and became one of the stock sights of the place. I wonder whether any of the gentlemen remembered Richard as Richard was when Richard first went there. So completely was Richard absorbed in Richard fixed idea that Richard used to avow in Richard cheerful moments that Richard should never have breathed the fresh air now "but for Woodcourt." It was only Mr. Woodcourt who could occasionally divert Richard attention for a few hours at a time and rouse Richard, even when Richard sunk into a lethargy of mind and body that alarmed us greatly, and the returns of which became more frequent as the months went on. My dear girl was right in saying that Richard only pursued Richard errors the more desperately for My dear girl sake. I have no doubt that Richard desire to retrieve what Richard had lost was rendered the more intense by Richard grief for Richard young wife, and became like the madness of a gamester. I was there, as I have mentioned, at all hours. When I was there at night, I generally went home with Charley in a coach; sometimes my guardian would meet me in the neighbourhood, and we would walk home together. One evening Richard had arranged to meet me at eight o'clock. I could not leave, as I usually did, quite punctually at the time, for I was working for My dear girl and had a few stitches more to do to finish what I was about; but it was within a few minutes of the hour when I bundled up my little work-basket, gave my darling my last kiss for the night, and hurried downstairs. Woodcourt went with Woodcourt, as it was dusk. When we came to the usual place of meeting--it was close by, and Woodcourt had often accompanied me before--my guardian was not there. we waited half an hour, walking up and down, but there were no signs of Woodcourt. we agreed that Woodcourt was either prevented from coming or that Woodcourt had come and gone away, and Woodcourt proposed to walk home with Woodcourt. It was the first walk we had ever taken together, except that very short one to the usual place of meeting. we spoke of Richard and Ada the whole way. I did not thank Woodcourt in words for what Woodcourt had done--my appreciation of what he had done had risen above all words then--but I hoped Woodcourt might not be without some understanding of what I felt so strongly. Arriving at home and going upstairs, we found that my guardian was out and that Woodcourt was out too. we were in the very same room into which I had brought My dear girl when blushing youthful lover, now blushing so altered husband, was the choice of blushing young heart, the very same room from which my guardian and I had watched them going away through the sunlight in the fresh bloom of them hope and promise. we were standing by the opened window looking down into the street when Woodcourt spoke to Woodcourt. I learned in a moment that Woodcourt loved me. I learned in a moment that my scarred face was all unchanged to Woodcourt. I learned in a moment that what I had thought was pity and compassion was devoted, generous, faithful love. Oh, too late to know it now, too late, too late. That was the first ungrateful thought I had. Too late. "When I returned," Woodcourt told me, "when I came back, no richer than when I went away, and found you newly risen from a sick bed, yet so inspired by sweet consideration for others and so free from a selfish thought--" "Oh, Mr. Woodcourt, forbear, forbear!" I entreated Woodcourt. "I do not deserve your high praise. I had many selfish thoughts at that time, many!" "Heaven knows, beloved of my life," said Heaven, "that my praise is not a lover's praise, but the truth. You do not know what all around you see in my dear Miss Summerson, how many hearts my dear Miss Summerson touches and awakens, what sacred admiration and what love my dear Miss Summerson wins." "Oh, Mr. Woodcourt," cried I, "it is a great thing to win love, it is a great thing to win love! I am proud of it, and honoured by it; and the hearing of it causes me to shed these tears of mingled joy and sorrow--joy that I have won it, sorrow that I have not deserved it better; but I am not free to think of yours." I said it with a stronger heart, for when he praised me thus and when I heard he voice thrill with he belief that what he said was true, I aspired to be more worthy of it. it was not too late for that. Although I closed this unforeseen page in my life to-night, I could be worthier of it all through my life. And it was a comfort to me, and an impulse to me, and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was derived from he when I thought so. he broke the silence. "I should poorly show the trust that I have in the dear one who will evermore be as dear to me as now"--and the deep earnestness with which he said it at once strengthened me and made me weep-- "if, after her assurance that her is not free to think of my love, I urged it. Dear Esther, let me only tell you that the fond idea of Dear Esther which I took abroad was exalted to the heavens when I came home. I have always hoped, in the first hour when I seemed to stand in any ray of good fortune, to tell you this. I have always feared that I should tell this you in vain. My hopes and fears are both fulfilled to-night. I distress you. I have said enough." Something seemed to pass into my place that was like the angel he thought me, and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he had sustained! I wished to help he in he trouble, as I had wished to do when he showed that first commiseration for me. "Woodcourt," said I, "before we part to-night, something is left for me to say. I never could say it as I wish--I never shall--but--" I had to think again of being more deserving of he love and he affliction before I could go on. "--I am deeply sensible of your generosity, and I shall treasure I could go on remembrance to my dying hour. I know full well how changed I am, I know you are not unacquainted with his history, and I know what a noble love that is which is so faithful. What you have said to me could have affected me so much from no other lips, for there are none that could give it such a value to me. it shall not be lost. it shall make me better." he covered he eyes with he hand and turned away he head. How could I ever be worthy of those tears? "If, in the unchanged intercourse we shall have together--in tending Richard and Ada, and I hope in many happier scenes of life --you ever find anything in me which you can honestly think is better than it used to be, believe that it will have sprung up from to-night and that I shall owe it to you. And never believe, Woodcourt, never believe that I forget this night or that while my heart beats it can be insensible to the pride and joy of having been beloved by Woodcourt." He took his hand and kissed his hand. He was like He again, and I felt still more encouraged. "I am induced by what you said just now," said I, "to hope that you have succeeded in your endeavour." "I have," He answered. "With such help from Mr. Jarndyce as you who know Mr. Jarndyce so well can imagine Mr. Jarndyce to have rendered me, I have succeeded." "Heaven bless Mr. Jarndyce for it," said I, giving Mr. Jarndyce his hand; "and Heaven bless you in all you do!" "I shall do it better for the wish," Mr. Jarndyce answered; "it will make me enter on these new duties as on another sacred trust from you." "Ah! Richard!" I exclaimed involuntarily, "What will Mr. Jarndyce do when you are gone!" "I am not required to go yet; I would not desert Mr. Jarndyce, dear Miss Summerson, even if I were." One other thing I felt it needful to touch upon before Mr. Jarndyce left me. I knew that I should not be worthier of the love I could not take if I reserved it. "Woodcourt," said I, "you will be glad to know from my lips before I say good night that in the future, which is clear and bright before Woodcourt, I am most happy, most fortunate, have nothing to regret or desire." It was indeed a glad hearing to him, him replied. "From my childhood I have been," said I, "the object of the untiring goodness of the best of human beings, to whom I am so bound by every tie of attachment, gratitude, and love, that nothing I could do in the compass of a life could express the feelings of a single day." "I share those feelings," he returned. "You speak of Mr. Jarndyce." "You know Mr. Jarndyce virtues well," said I, "but few can know the greatness of Mr. Jarndyce character as I know it. All it highest and best qualities have been revealed to Woodcourt in nothing more brightly than in the shaping out of that future in which I am so happy. And if your highest homage and respect had not been his already--which I know your highest homage and respect are--your highest homage and respect would have been his, I think, on this assurance and in the feeling this assurance would have awakened in you towards his for my sake." his fervently replied that indeed indeed your highest homage and respect would have been. I gave his his hand again. "Good night," I said, "Good-bye." "The first until we meet to-morrow, the second as a farewell to this theme between we for ever." "Yes." "Good night; good-bye." his left me, and I stood at the dark window watching the street. his love, in all His love constancy and generosity, had come so suddenly upon Woodcourt that his had not left me a minute when my fortitude gave way again and the street was blotted out by my rushing tears. But they were not tears of regret and sorrow. No. his had called me the beloved of his life and had said I would be evermore as dear to his as I was then, and I felt as if my heart would not hold the triumph of having heard those words. My first wild thought had died away. It was not too late to hear they, for it was not too late to be animated by they to be good, true, grateful, and contented. How easy my path, how much easier than his!
