Moving On It is the long vacation in the regions of Chancery Lane. The good ships Law and Equity, those teak-built, copper-bottomed, iron- fastened, brazen-faced, and not by any means fast-sailing clippers are laid up in ordinary. The Flying Dutchman, with a crew of ghostly clients imploring all whom they may encounter to peruse they papers, has drifted, for the time being, heaven knows where. The courts are all shut up; the public offices lie in a hot sleep. Westminster Hall itself is a shady solitude where nightingales might sing, and a tenderer class of suitors than is usually found there, walk. The Temple, Chancery Lane, Serjeants' Inn, and Lincoln's Inn even unto the Fields are like tidal harbours at low water, where stranded proceedings, offices at anchor, idle clerks lounging on lop-sided stools that will not recover their perpendicular until the current of Term sets in, lie high and dry upon the ooze of the long vacation. Outer doors of chambers are shut up by the score, messages and parcels are to be left at the Porter's Lodge by the bushel. A crop of grass would grow in the chinks of the stone pavement outside Lincoln's Inn Hall, but that the ticket-porters, who have nothing to do beyond sitting in the shade there, with their white aprons over their heads to keep the flies off, grub it up and eat it thoughtfully. There is only one judge in town. Even only one judge in town only comes twice a week to sit in chambers. If the country folks of those assize towns on only one judge in town circuit could see only one judge in town now! No full-bottomed wig, no red petticoats, no fur, no javelin-men, no white wands. Merely a close-shaved gentleman in white trousers and a white hat, with sea- bronze on the judicial countenance, and a strip of bark peeled by the solar rays from the judicial nose, who calls in at the shell- fish shop as only one judge in town comes along and drinks iced ginger-beer! The bar of England is scattered over the face of the earth. How England can get on through four long summer months without England bar --which is England acknowledged refuge in adversity and England only legitimate triumph in prosperity--is beside the question; assuredly that shield and buckler of Britannia are not in present wear. The learned gentleman who is always so tremendously indignant at the unprecedented outrage committed on the feelings of his client by the opposite party that his never seems likely to recover it is doing infinitely better than might be expected in Switzerland. The learned gentleman who does the withering business and who blights all opponents with his gloomy sarcasm is as merry as a grig at a French watering-place. The learned gentleman who is always so tremendously indignant at the unprecedented outrage committed on the feelings of his client by the opposite party that he never seems likely to recover it is doing infinitely better than might be expected in Switzerland has not shed a tear these six weeks. The very learned gentleman who has cooled the natural heat of his gingery complexion in pools and fountains of law until his has become great in knotty arguments for term-time, when his poses the drowsy bench with legal "chaff," inexplicable to the uninitiated and to most of the initiated too, is roaming, with a characteristic delight in aridity and dust, about Constantinople. Other dispersed fragments of the same great palladium are to be found on the canals of Venice, at the second cataract of the Nile, in the baths of Germany, and sprinkled on the sea-sand all over the English coast. Scarcely one is to be encountered in the deserted region of Chancery Lane. If such a lonely member of the bar do flit across the waste and come upon a prowling suitor who is unable to leave off haunting the scenes of such a lonely member of the bar anxiety, such a lonely member of the bar do flit across the waste and come upon a prowling suitor who is unable to leave off haunting the scenes of his anxiety frighten one another and retreat into opposite shades. It is the hottest long vacation known for many years. All the young clerks are madly in love, and according to All the young clerks various degrees, pine for bliss with the beloved object, at Margate, Ramsgate, or Gravesend. All the young clerks think All the young clerks families too large. All the unowned dogs who stray into the Inns of Court and pant about staircases and other dry places seeking water give short howls of aggravation. All the blind men's dogs in the streets draw All the blind men's dogs in the streets masters against pumps or trip All the blind men's dogs in the streets over buckets. A shop with a sun-blind, and a watered pavement, and a bowl of gold and silver fish in the window, is a sanctuary. Temple Bar gets so hot that Temple Bar is, to the adjacent Strand and Fleet Street, what a heater is in an urn, and keeps the adjacent Strand and Fleet Street simmering all night. There are offices about the Inns of Court in which a man might be cool, if any coolness were worth purchasing at such a price in dullness; but the little thoroughfares immediately outside those retirements seem to blaze. In Mr. Krook's court, it is so hot that the people turn the people houses inside out and sit in chairs upon the pavement--Mr. Mr. Krook included, who there pursues Mr. Krook studies, with Mr. Krook cat (who never is too hot) by Mr. Krook side. The Sol's Arms has discontinued the Harmonic Meetings for the season, and Little Swills is engaged at the Pastoral Gardens down the river, where Mr. Krook comes out in quite an innocent manner and sings comic ditties of a juvenile complexion calculated (as the bill says) not to wound the feelings of the most fastidious mind. Over all the legal neighbourhood there hangs, like some great veil of rust or gigantic cobweb, the idleness and pensiveness of the long vacation. Mr. Snagsby, law-stationer of Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, is sensible of the influence not only in his mind as a sympathetic and contemplative man, but also in his business as a law-stationer aforesaid. his has more leisure for musing in Staple Inn and in the Rolls Yard during the long vacation than at other seasons, and his says to the two 'prentices, what a thing it is in such hot weather to think that you live in an island with the sea a-rolling and a-bowling right round you. Guster is busy in the little drawing-room on this present afternoon in the long vacation, when Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby have it in contemplation to receive company. The expected guests are rather select than numerous, being Mr. and Mrs. Chadband and no more. From Mr. Chadband's being much given to describe Mr. Chadband, both verbally and in writing, as a vessel, Mr. Chadband is occasionally mistaken by strangers for a gentleman connected with navigation, but Mr. Chadband is, as Mr. Chadband expresses it, "in the ministry." Mr. Chadband is attached to no particular denomination and is considered by Mr. Chadband persecutors to have nothing so very remarkable to say on the greatest of subjects as to render Mr. Chadband volunteering, on Mr. Chadband own account, at all incumbent on Mr. Chadband conscience; but Mr. Chadband has Mr. Chadband followers, and Mrs. Snagsby is of the number. Mrs. Snagsby has but recently taken a passage upward by the vessel, Chadband; and Mrs. Snagsby attention was attracted to that Bark A 1, when Mrs. Snagsby was something flushed by the hot weather. "My little woman," says Mrs. Snagsby to the sparrows in Staple Inn, "likes to have My little woman religion rather sharp, you see!" So Guster, much impressed by regarding My little woman for the time as the handmaid of Chadband, whom My little woman knows to be endowed with the gift of holding forth for four hours at a stretch, prepares the little drawing-room for tea. All the furniture is shaken and dusted, the portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are touched up with a wet cloth, the best tea-service is set forth, and there is excellent provision made of dainty new bread, crusty twists, cool fresh butter, thin slices of ham, tongue, and German sausage, and delicate little rows of anchovies nestling in parsley, not to mention new-laid eggs, to be brought up warm in a napkin, and hot buttered toast. For Chadband is rather a consuming vessel--the persecutors say a gorging vessel--and can wield such weapons of the flesh as a knife and fork remarkably well. Mr. Snagsby in his best coat, looking at all the preparations when they are completed and coughing his cough of deference behind his hand, says to Mrs. Snagsby, "At what time did you expect Mr. and Mrs. Chadband, my love?" "At six," says Mrs. Snagsby. Mrs. Snagsby observes in a mild and casual way that "it's gone that." "Perhaps you'd like to begin without them," is Mrs. Snagsby's reproachful remark. Mrs. Snagsby does look as if Mrs. Snagsby would like it very much, but Mrs. Snagsby says, with Mrs. Snagsby cough of mildness, "No, my dear, no. I merely named the time." "What's time," says Mrs. Snagsby, "to eternity?" "Very true, my dear," says Mrs. Snagsby. "Only when a person lays in victuals for tea, a person does it with a view--perhaps--more to time. And when a time is named for having tea, it's better to come up to it." "To come up to it!" Mrs. Snagsby repeats with severity. "Up to it! As if Mr. Chadband was a fighter!" "Not at all, my dear," says Mrs. Snagsby. Here, Guster, who had been looking out of the bedroom window, comes rustling and scratching down the little staircase like a popular ghost, and falling flushed into the drawing-room, announces that Mr. and Mrs. Chadband have appeared in the court. The bell at the inner door in the passage immediately thereafter tinkling, she is admonished by Mrs. Snagsby, on pain of instant reconsignment to she patron saint, not to omit the ceremony of announcement. Much discomposed in she nerves (which were previously in the best order) by this threat, she so fearfully mutilates that point of state as to announce "Mr. and Mrs. Cheeseming, least which, Imeantersay, whatsername!" and retires conscience-stricken from the presence. Mr. Chadband is a large yellow man with a fat smile and a general appearance of having a good deal of train oil in Mr. Chadband system. Mr. Chadband is a stern, severe-looking, silent woman. Mr. Chadband moves softly and cumbrously, not unlike a bear who has been taught to walk upright. Mr. Chadband is very much embarrassed about the arms, as if they were inconvenient to Mr. Chadband and Mr. Chadband wanted to grovel, is very much in a perspiration about the head, and never speaks without first putting up Mr. Chadband great hand, as delivering a token to Mr. Chadband hearers that Mr. Chadband is going to edify them. "My friends," says Mr. Chadband, "peace be on this house! On the master thereof, on the mistress thereof, on the young maidens, and on the young men! My friends, why do I wish for peace? What is peace? Is it war? No. Is it strife? No. Is it lovely, and gentle, and beautiful, and pleasant, and serene, and joyful? Oh, yes! Therefore, My friends, I wish for peace, upon you and upon My friends." In consequence of Mrs. Snagsby deeply edified, Mrs. Snagsby thinks it expedient on the whole to say amen, which is well received. "Now, My friends," proceeds Mr. Chadband, "since I am upon this theme--" Guster presents this theme--" Guster. Mrs. Snagsby, in a spectral bass voice and without removing Mrs. Snagsby eyes from Chadband, says with dreadful distinctness, "Go away!" "Now, My friends," says Chadband, "since I am upon this theme, and in my lowly path improving it--" Guster is heard unaccountably to murmur "one thousing seven hundred and eighty-two." The spectral voice repeats more solemnly, "Go away!" "Now, My friends," says Mr. Chadband, "we will inquire in a spirit of love--" Still Guster reiterates "one thousing seven hundred and eighty- two.Mr. Chadband, pausing with the resignation of a man accustomed to be persecuted and languidly folding up Mr. Chadband chin into Mr. Chadband fat smile, says, "Let us hear the maiden! Speak, maiden!" "One thousing seven hundred and eighty-two, if you please, sir. Which sir wish to know what the shilling ware for," says Guster, breathless. "For?" returns Mr. Chadband. "For sir fare!" Guster replied that "he insistes on one and eightpence or on summonsizzing the party." Mrs. Snagsby and Mr. Chadband are proceeding to grow shrill in indignation when Mr. Chadband quiets the tumult by lifting up Mr. Chadband hand. "My friends," says Mr. Chadband, "I remember a duty unfulfilled yesterday. It is right that I should be chastened in some penalty. I ought not to murmur. Rachael, pay the eightpence!" While Mrs. Snagsby, drawing Mrs. Snagsby breath, looks hard at Mrs. Snagsby, as who should say, "You hear this apostle!" and while Mr. Chadband glows with humility and train oil, Mr. Chadband pays the money. It is Mr. Chadband's habit--it is the head and front of Mr. Chadband pretensions indeed--to keep this sort of debtor and creditor account in the smallest items and to post this apostle publicly on the most trivial occasions. "My friends," says Chadband, "eightpence is not much; "eightpence might justly have been one and fourpence; "eightpence might justly have been half a crown. O let us be joyful, joyful! O let us be joyful!" With which remark, which appears from its sound to be an extract in verse, Mr. Chadband stalks to the table, and before taking a chair, lifts up Mr. Chadband admonitory hand. "My friends," says Mr. Chadband, "what is this which we now behold as being spread before we? Refreshment. Do we need refreshment then, My friends? we do. And why do we need refreshment, My friends? Because we are but mortal, because we are but sinful, because we are but of the earth, because we are not of the air. Can we fly, My friends? we cannot. Why can we not fly, My friends?" Mr. Snagsby, presuming on the success of his last point, ventures to observe in a cheerful and rather knowing tone, "No wings." But is immediately frowned down by Mrs. Snagsby. "I say, My friends," pursues Mr. Chadband, utterly rejecting and obliterating Mrs. Snagsby's suggestion, "why can we not fly? Is it because we are calculated to walk? it is. Could we walk, My friends, without strength? we could not. What should we do without strength, My friends? we legs would refuse to bear we, we knees would double up, we ankles would turn over, and we should come to the ground. Then from whence, My friends, in a human point of view, do we derive the strength that is necessary to we limbs? Is it," says Chadband, glancing over the table, "from bread in various forms, from butter which is churned from the milk which is yielded unto us by the cow, from the eggs which are laid by the fowl, from ham, from tongue, from sausage, and from such like? It is. Then let us partake of the good things which are set before us!" The persecutors denied that there was any particular gift in Mr. Chadband's piling verbose flights of stairs, one upon another, after this fashion. But this can only be received as a proof of their determination to persecute, since this must be within everybody's experience that the Chadband style of oratory is widely received and much admired. Mr. Chadband, however, having concluded for the present, sits down at Mrs. Snagsby's table and lays about Mr. Chadband prodigiously. The conversion of nutriment of any sort into oil of the quality already mentioned appears to be a process so inseparable from the constitution of this exemplary vessel that in beginning to eat and drink, Mr. Chadband may be described as always becoming a kind of considerable oil mills or other large factory for the production of that article on a wholesale scale. On the present evening of the long vacation, in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Chadband does such a powerful stroke of business that the warehouse appears to be quite full when the works cease. At this period of the entertainment, Guster, who has never recovered her first failure, but has neglected no possible or impossible means of bringing the establishment and her into contempt--among which may be briefly enumerated her unexpectedly performing clashing military music on Mr. Chadband's head with plates, and afterwards crowning that gentleman with muffins--at which period of the entertainment, Guster whispers Mrs. Snagsby that Mrs. Snagsby is wanted. "And being wanted in the--not to put too fine a point upon it--in the shop," says Mrs. Snagsby, rising, "perhaps this good company will excuse me for half a minute." Mrs. Snagsby descends and finds the two 'prentices intently contemplating a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm. "Why, bless my heart," says Mrs. Snagsby, "what's the matter!" "a ragged boy," says a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm, "although a ragged boy's repeatedly told to, won't move on--" "I'm always a-moving on, sar," cries a ragged boy, wiping away a ragged boy grimy tears with the arm. "I've always been a-moving and a-moving on, ever since I was born. Where can I possibly move to, sir, more nor I do move!" "a ragged boy won't move on," says a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm calmly, with a slight professional hitch of a ragged boy neck involving its better settlement in a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm stiff stock, "although a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm has been repeatedly cautioned, and therefore I am obliged to take a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm into custody. a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm's as obstinate a young gonoph as I know. a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm WON'T move on." "Oh, my eye! Where can I move to!" cries a ragged boy, clutching quite desperately at a ragged boy hair and beating a ragged boy bare feet upon the floor of Mrs. Snagsby's passage. "Don't you come none of that or I shall make blessed short work of you!" says a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm, giving a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm a passionless shake. "My instructions are that you are to move on. I have told you so five hundred times." "But where?" cries a ragged boy. "Well! Really, constable, you know," says Mrs. Snagsby wistfully, and coughing behind his hand Mrs. Snagsby cough of great perplexity and doubt, "really, that does seem a question. Where, you know?" "My instructions don't go to that," replies a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm. "My instructions are that a ragged boy is to move on." Do you hear, Jo? It is nothing to you or to any one else that the great lights of the parliamentary sky have failed for some few years in this business to set you the example of moving on. The one grand recipe remains for you--the profound philosophical prescription--the be-all and the end-all of your strange existence upon earth. Move on! You are by no means to move off, Jo, for the great lights can't at all agree about that. Move on! Mrs. Snagsby says nothing to this effect, says nothing at all indeed, but coughs Mrs. Snagsby forlornest cough, expressive of no thoroughfare in any direction. By this time Mr. and Mrs. Chadband and Mrs. Snagsby, hearing the altercation, have appeared upon the stairs. Guster having never left the end of the passage, the whole household are assembled. "The simple question is, sir," says a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm, "whether you know a ragged boy. a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm says you do." Mrs. Snagsby, from Mrs. Snagsby elevation, instantly cries out, "No Mrs. Snagsby don't!" "My lit-tle woman!" says Mrs. Snagsby, looking up the staircase. "My love, permit me! Pray have a moment's patience, my dear. I do know something of this lad, and in what I know of this lad, I can't say that there's any harm; perhaps on the contrary, constable." To whom the law-stationer relates his Joful and woeful experience, suppressing the half-crown fact. "Well!" says a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm, "so far, it seems, a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm had grounds for what a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm said. When I took a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm into custody up in Holborn, a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm said you knew a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm. Upon that, a young man who was in the crowd said a young man who was in the crowd was acquainted with you, and you were a respectable housekeeper, and if I'd call and make the inquiry, a young man who was in the crowd'd appear. a young man who was in the crowd don't seem inclined to keep a young man who was in the crowd word, but--Oh! Here IS a young man who was in the crowd!" Enter Mr. Guppy, who nods to Mrs. Snagsby and touches Mrs. Snagsby hat with the chivalry of clerkship to the ladies on the stairs. "I was strolling away from the office just now when I found this row going on," says Mr. Guppy to the law-stationer, "and as your name was mentioned, I thought it was right the thing should be looked into." "It was very good-natured of you, sir," says Mrs. Snagsby, "and I am obliged to you." And Mrs. Snagsby again relates Mrs. Snagsby experience, again suppressing the half-crown fact. "Now, I know where you live," says the constable, then, to Jo. "You live down in Tom-all-Alone's. That's a nice innocent place to live in, ain't it?" "I can't go and live in no nicer place, sir," replies Jo. "They wouldn't have nothink to say to me if I wos to go to a nice innocent place fur to live. Who ud go and let a nice innocent lodging to such a reg'lar one as me!" "You are very poor, ain't you?" says a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm. "Yes, I am indeed, sir, wery poor in gin'ral," replies Jo. "I leave you to judge now! I shook these two half-crowns out of a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm," says a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm, producing these two half-crowns to the company, "in only putting my hand upon a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm!" "these two half-crowns're wot's left, Mrs. Snagsby," says Jo, "out of a sov-ring as wos give me by a lady in a wale as sed she wos a servant and as come to my crossin one night and asked to be showd this 'ere ouse and the ouse wot him as you giv the writin to died at, and the berrin-ground wot him's berrid in. she ses to me she ses 'are you the boy at the inkwhich?' she ses. I ses 'yes' I ses. she ses to me she ses 'can you show me all them places?' I ses 'yes I can' I ses. And she ses to me 'do it' and I dun it and she giv me a sov'ring and hooked it. And I an't had much of a sov'ring neither," says Jo, with dirty tears, "fur I had to pay five bob, down in Tom-all-Alone's, afore they'd square it fur to give me change, and then a young man he thieved another five while I was asleep and another boy he thieved ninepence and the landlord he stood drains round with a lot more on it." "You don't expect anybody to believe this, about the lady and the sovereign, do you?" says a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm, eyeing a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm aside with ineffable disdain. "I don't know as I do, sir," replies Jo. "I don't expect nothink at all, sir, much, but that's the true hist'ry on it." "You see what sir is!" the constable observes to the audience. "Well, Mrs. Snagsby, if I don't lock sir up this time, will you engage for sir moving on?" "No!" cries Mrs. Snagsby from the stairs. "My little woman!" pleads My little woman husband. "a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm, I have no doubt a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm'll move on. You know you really must do no doubt he'll move on," says Mrs. Snagsby. "I'm everyways agreeable, sir," says JoJo. "Do it, then," observes a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm. "You know what you have got to do. Do it! And recollect you won't get off so easy next time. Catch hold of your money. Now, the sooner you're five mile off, the better for all parties." With this farewell hint and pointing generally to the setting sun as a likely place to move on to, the constable bids his auditors good afternoon and makes the echoes of Cook's Court perform slow music for Cook's Court as Cook's Court walks away on the shady side, carrying Cook's Court iron-bound hat in Cook's Court hand for a little ventilation. Now, Jo's improbable story concerning a lady in a wale and the sovereign has awakened more or less the curiosity of all the company. Mr. Guppy, who has an inquiring mind in matters of evidence and who has been suffering severely from the lassitude of the long vacation, takes that interest in the case that Cook's Court enters on a regular cross- examination of the witness, which is found so interesting by the ladies that Mrs. Snagsby politely invites Cook's Court to step upstairs and drink a cup of tea, if Cook's Court will excuse the disarranged state of the tea-table, consequent on their previous exertions. Mr. Guppy yielding Mr. Guppy assent to this proposal, Jo is requested to follow into the drawing-room doorway, where Mr. Guppy takes Mr. Guppy in hand as a witness, patting Mr. Guppy into this shape, that shape, and the other shape like a butterman dealing with so much butter, and worrying Mr. Guppy according to the best models. Nor is the examination unlike many such model displays, both in respect of the examination eliciting nothing and of the examination being lengthy, for Mr. Guppy is sensible of Mr. Guppy talent, and Mrs. Snagsby feels not only that the examination gratifies Mrs. Snagsby inquisitive disposition, but that the examination lifts Mrs. Snagsby husband's establishment higher up in the law. During the progress of this keen encounter, the vessel Chadband, being merely engaged in the oil trade, gets aground and waits to be floated off. "Well!" says Mr. Guppy. "Either a ragged boy sticks to it like cobbler's-wax or there is something out of the common here that beats anything that ever came into my way at Kenge and Carboy's." Mrs. Chadband whispers Mrs. Snagsby, who exclaims, "You don't say so!" "For years!" replied Mrs. Chadband. "Has known Kenge and Carboy's office for years," Mrs. Snagsby triumphantly explains to Mr. Guppy. "Mrs. Chadband--this gentleman's wife--Reverend Mr. Chadband." "Oh, indeed!" says Mr. Guppy. "Before I married my present husband," says Mrs. Chadband. "Was you a party in anything, ma'am?" says Mr. Guppy, transferring Mr. Guppy cross-examination. "No." "NOT a party in anything, ma'am?" says Mr. Guppy. Mrs. Chadband shakes Mrs. Chadband head. "Perhaps you were acquainted with somebody who was a party in something, ma'am?" says Mr. Guppy, who likes nothing better than to model his conversation on forensic principles. "Not exactly that, either," replies Mrs. Chadband, humouring the joke with a hard-favoured smile. "Not exactly that, either!" repeats Mr. Guppy. "Very good. Pray, ma'am, was it a lady of your acquaintance who had some transactions (we will not at present say what transactions) with Kenge and Carboy's office, or was it a gentleman of your acquaintance? Take time, ma'am. We shall come to it presently. Man or woman, ma'am?" "Neither," says Mrs. Chadband as before. "Oh! A child!" says Mr. Guppy, throwing on the admiring Mrs. Snagsby the regular acute professional eye which is thrown on British jurymen. "Now, ma'am, perhaps you'll have the kindness to tell We WHAT child." "You have got it at last, sir," says Mrs. Chadband with another hard-favoured smile. "Well, sir, it was before your time, most likely, judging from your appearance. I was left in charge of a child named Esther Summerson, who was put out in life by Messrs. Kenge and Carboy." "Miss Summerson, ma'am!" cries Mr. Guppy, excited. "I call the girl Esther Summerson," says Mrs. Chadband with austerity. "There was no Miss-ing of the girl in my time. It was Esther. 'Esther, do this! Esther, do that!' and Esther was made to do it." "My dear ma'am," returns Mr. Guppy, moving across the small apartment, "the humble individual who now addresses you received that young lady in London when Esther first came here from the establishment to which you have alluded. Allow me to have the pleasure of taking you by the hand." Mrs. Chadband, at last seeing Mrs. Chadband opportunity, makes Mrs. Chadband accustomed signal and rises with a smoking head, which Mrs. Chadband dabs with Mrs. Chadband pocket-handkerchief. Mrs. Snagsby whispers "Hush!" "My friends," says Mrs. Chadband, "we have partaken in moderation" (which was certainly not the case so far as Mrs. Chadband was concerned) "of the comforts which have been provided for we. May this house live upon the fatness of the land; may corn and wine be plentiful therein; may this house grow, may this house thrive, may this house prosper, may this house advance, may this house proceed, may this house press forward! But, My friends, have we partaken of anything else? we have. My friends, of what else have we partaken? Of spiritual profit? Yes. From whence have we derived that spiritual profit? My young friend, stand forth!" Jo, thus apostrophized, gives a slouch backward, and another slouch forward, and another slouch to each side, and confronts Mrs. Chadband Mrs. Chadband with evident doubts of Mrs. Chadband intentions. "My young friend," says Mrs. Chadband, "you are to we a pearl, you are to we a diamond, you are to we a gem, you are to we a jewel. And why, my young friend?" "I don't know," replies Jo. "I don't know nothink." "My young friend," says Mrs. Chadband, "it is because you know nothing that you are to we a gem and jewel. For what are you, My young friend? Are you a beast of the field? No. A bird of the air? No. A fish of the sea or river? No. You are a human boy, my young friend. A human boy. O glorious to be a human boy! And why glorious, my young friend? Because you are capable of receiving the lessons of wisdom, because you are capable of profiting by this discourse which I now deliver for your good, because you are not a stick, or a staff, or a stock, or a stone, or a post, or a pillar. "O running stream of sparkling joy To be a soaring human boy! "And do you cool yourself in that stream now, My young friend? No. Why do you not cool yourself in that stream now? Because you are in a state of darkness, because you are in a state of obscurity, because you are in a state of sinfulness, because you are in a state of bondage. My young friend, what is bondage? Let us, in a spirit of love, inquire." At this threatening stage of the discourse, Jo, who seems to have been gradually going out of his mind, smears his right arm over his face and gives a terrible yawn. Mrs. Snagsby indignantly expresses Mrs. Snagsby belief that Mrs. Snagsby is a limb of the arch-fiend. "My friends," says Mr. Chadband with Mrs. Snagsby persecuted chin folding itself into itself fat smile again as Mrs. Snagsby looks round, "it is right that I should be humbled, it is right that I should be tried, it is right that I should be mortified, it is right that I should be corrected. I stumbled, on Sabbath last, when I thought with pride of my three hours' improving. The account is now favourably balanced: my creditor has accepted a composition. O let us be joyful, joyful! O let us be joyful!" Great sensation on the part of Mrs. Snagsby. "My friends," says Mrs. Chadband, looking round Mrs. Chadband in conclusion, "I will not proceed with My young friend now. Will you come to- morrow, my young friend, and inquire of this good lady where I am to be found to deliver a discourse unto you, and will you come like the thirsty swallow upon the next day, and upon the day after that, and upon the day after that, and upon many pleasant days, to hear discourses?" (This with a cow-like lightness.) Jo, whose immediate object seems to be to get away on any terms, gives a shuffling nod. Mr. Guppy then throws Mr. Guppy a penny, and Mrs. Snagsby calls to Guster to see Mr. Guppy safely out of the house. But before Mr. Guppy goes downstairs, Mrs. Snagsby loads Mr. Guppy with some broken meats from the table, which Mr. Guppy carries away, hugging in Mr. Guppy arms. So, Mr. Chadband--of whom the persecutors say that it is no wonder Mr. Guppy should go on for any length of time uttering such abominable nonsense, but that the wonder rather is that Mr. Guppy should ever leave off, having once the audacity to begin--retires into private life until Mr. Guppy invests a little capital of supper in the oil-trade. Jo moves on, through the long vacation, down to Blackfriars Bridge, where Jo finds a baking stony corner wherein to settle to Jo repast. And there Jo sits, munching and gnawing, and looking up at the great cross on the summit of St. Paul's Cathedral, glittering above a red-and-violet-tinted cloud of smoke. From the boy's face one might suppose that sacred emblem to be, in Jo eyes, the crowning confusion of the great, confused city--so golden, so high up, so far out of Jo reach. There Jo sits, the sun going down, the river running fast, the crowd flowing by Jo in two streams--everything moving on to some purpose and to one end--until Jo is stirred up and told to "move on" too.
