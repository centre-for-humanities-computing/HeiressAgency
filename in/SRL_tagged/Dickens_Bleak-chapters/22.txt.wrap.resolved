A New Lodger The long vacation saunters on towards term-time like an idle river very leisurely strolling down a flat country to the sea. Mr. Guppy saunters along with it congenially. Mr. Guppy has blunted the blade of Mr. Guppy penknife and broken the point off by sticking that instrument into Mr. Guppy desk in every direction. Not that Mr. Guppy bears the desk any ill will, but Mr. Guppy must do something, and it must be something of an unexciting nature, which will lay neither Mr. Guppy physical nor Mr. Guppy intellectual energies under too heavy contribution. Mr. Guppy finds that nothing agrees with Mr. Guppy so well as to make little gyrations on one leg of Mr. Guppy stool, and stab Mr. Guppy desk, and gape. Kenge and Carboy are out of town, and the articled clerk has taken out a shooting license and gone down to the articled clerk father's, and Mr. Guppy's two fellow-stipendiaries are away on leave. Mr. Guppy and Mr. Richard Carstone divide the dignity of the office. But Mr. Carstone is for the time being established in Kenge's room, whereat Mr. Guppy chafes. So exceedingly that Mr. Carstone with biting sarcasm informs Mr. Carstone mother, in the confidential moments when Mr. Carstone sups with his mother off a lobster and lettuce in the Old Street Road, that Mr. Carstone is afraid the office is hardly good enough for swells, and that if Mr. Carstone had known there was a swell coming, Mr. Carstone would have got the office painted. Mr. Guppy suspects everybody who enters on the occupation of a stool in Kenge and Carboy's office of entertaining, as a matter of course, sinister designs upon Mr. Guppy. Mr. Guppy is clear that every such person wants to depose Mr. Guppy. If Mr. Guppy be ever asked how, why, when, or wherefore, Mr. Guppy shuts up one eye and shakes Mr. Guppy head. On the strength of these profound views, Mr. Guppy in the most ingenious manner takes infinite pains to counterplot when there is no plot, and plays the deepest games of chess without any adversary. It is a source of much gratification to Mr. Guppy, therefore, to find the new-comer constantly poring over the papers in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, for Mr. Guppy well knows that nothing but confusion and failure can come of that. Mr. Guppy satisfaction communicates His satisfaction to a third saunterer through the long vacation in Kenge and Carboy's office, to wit, Young Smallweed. Whether Young Smallweed (metaphorically called Small and eke Chick Weed, as it were jocularly to express a fledgling) was ever a boy is much doubted in Lincoln's Inn. a boy is now something under fifteen and an old limb of the law. a boy is facetiously understood to entertain a passion for a lady at a cigar-shop in the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane and for her sake to have broken off a contract with another lady, to whom a boy had been engaged some years. a boy is a town-made article, of small stature and weazen features, but may be perceived from a considerable distance by means of a boy very tall hat. To become a Guppy is the object of a boy ambition. a boy dresses at that gentleman (by whom a boy is patronized), talks at a boy, walks at a boy, founds a boy entirely on a boy. a boy is honoured with a Guppy's particular confidence and occasionally advises a boy, from the deep wells of a boy experience, on difficult points in private life. a Guppy has been lolling out of window all the morning after trying all the stools in succession and finding none of all the stools in succession easy, and after several times putting a Guppy head into the iron safe with a notion of cooling the iron. Mr. Smallweed has been twice dispatched for effervescent drinks, and has twice mixed all the stools in succession in the two official tumblers and stirred all the stools in succession up with the ruler. a Guppy propounds for Mr. Smallweed's consideration the paradox that the more you drink the thirstier you are and reclines a Guppy head upon the window- sill in a state of hopeless languor. While thus looking out into the shade of Old Square, Lincoln's Inn, surveying the intolerable bricks and mortar, a Guppy becomes conscious of a manly whisker emerging from the cloistered walk below and turning a manly whisker emerging from the cloistered walk below and turning itself up in the direction of his face up in the direction of a Guppy face. At the same time, a low whistle is wafted through the Inn and a suppressed voice cries, "Hip! Gup-py!" "Why, you don't mean it!" says a Guppy, aroused. "Small! Here's Jobling!" Small's head looks out of window too and nods to Jobling. "Where have you sprung up from?" inquires a Guppy. "From the market-gardens down by Deptford. I can't stand it any longer. I must enlist. I say! I wish you'd lend me half a crown. Upon my soul, I'm hungry." Jobling looks hungry and also has the appearance of having run to seed in the market-gardens down by Deptford. "I say! Just throw out half a crown if you have got one to spare. I want to get some dinner." "Will you come and dine with me?" says a Guppy, throwing out the coin, which Jobling catches neatly. "How long should I have to hold out?" says Jobling. "Not half an hour. I am only waiting here till the enemy goes, returns a Guppy, butting inward with a Guppy head. "What enemy?" "A new one. Going to be articled. Will you wait?" "Can you give a fellow anything to read in the meantime?" says Jobling. Smallweed suggests the law list. But Jobling declares with much earnestness that Jobling "can't stand it." "You shall have the paper," says a Guppy. "a Guppy shall bring the paper down. But you had better not be seen about here. Sit on our staircase and read. It's a quiet place." Jobling nods intelligence and acquiescence. Smallweed supplies him with the newspaper and occasionally drops him eye upon him from the landing as a precaution against him becoming disgusted with waiting and making an untimely departure. At last the enemy retreats, and then Smallweed fetches Jobling up. "Well, and how are you?" says a Guppy, shaking hands with a Guppy. "So, so. How are you?" a Guppy replying that a Guppy is not much to boast of, Mr. Jobling ventures on the question, "How is SHE?" a Guppy resents as a liberty, retorting, "Jobling, there ARE chords in the human mind--" Jobling begs pardon. "Any subject but that!" says a Guppy with a gloomy enjoyment of a Guppy injury. "For there ARE chords, Jobling--" Mr. Jobling begs pardon again. During this short colloquy, the active Smallweed, who is of the dinner party, has written in legal characters on a slip of paper, "Return immediately." This notification to all whom it may concern, a Guppy inserts in the letter-box, and then putting on the tall hat at the angle of inclination at which a Guppy wears a Guppy, informs a Guppy patron that they may now make they scarce. Accordingly they betake they to a neighbouring dining-house, of the class known among a neighbouring dining-house frequenters by the denomination slap- bang, where the waitress, a bouncing young female of forty, is supposed to have made some impression on the susceptible Smallweed, of whom it may be remarked that a Guppy is a weird changeling to whom years are nothing. a Guppy stands precociously possessed of centuries of owlish wisdom. If a Guppy ever lay in a cradle, it seems as if a Guppy must have lain there in a tail-coat. a Guppy has an old, old eye, has Smallweed; and a Guppy drinks and smokes in a monkeyish way; and a Guppy neck is stiff in a Guppy collar; and a Guppy is never to be taken in; and a Guppy knows all about it, whatever it is. In short, in a Guppy bringing up a Guppy has been so nursed by Law and Equity that a Guppy has become a kind of fossil imp, to account for whose terrestrial existence whose terrestrial existence is reported at the public offices that a Guppy father was John Doe and a Guppy mother the only female member of the Roe family, also that a Guppy first long-clothes were made from a blue bag. Into the dining-house, unaffected by the seductive show in the window of artificially whitened cauliflowers and poultry, verdant baskets of peas, coolly blooming cucumbers, and joints ready for the spit, Mr. Smallweed leads the way. the seductive show in the window of artificially whitened cauliflowers and poultry, verdant baskets of peas know Mr. Smallweed there and defer to Mr. Smallweed. Mr. Smallweed has Mr. Smallweed favourite box, Mr. Smallweed bespeaks all the papers, Mr. Smallweed is down upon bald patriarchs, who keep all the papers more than ten minutes afterwards. It is of no use trying Mr. Smallweed with anything less than a full-sized "bread" or proposing to Mr. Smallweed any joint in cut unless it is in the very best cut. In the matter of gravy Mr. Smallweed is adamant. Conscious of Mr. Smallweed elfin power and submitting to Mr. Smallweed dread experience, a Guppy consults Mr. Smallweed in the choice of that day's banquet, turning an appealing look towards Mr. Smallweed as the waitress repeats the catalogue of viands and saying "What do YOU take, Chick?" Chick, out of the profundity of Chick artfulness, preferring "veal and ham and French beans--and don't you forget the stuffing, Polly" (with an unearthly cock of Chick venerable eye), Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling give the like order. Three pint pots of half-and-half are superadded. Quickly the waitress returns bearing what is apparently a model of the Tower of Babel but what is really a pile of plates and flat tin dish-covers. Mr. Smallweed, approving of what is set before Chick, conveys intelligent benignity into Chick ancient eye and winks upon her. Then, amid a constant coming in, and going out, and running about, and a clatter of crockery, and a rumbling up and down of the machine which brings the nice cuts from the kitchen, and a shrill crying for more nice cuts down the speaking-pipe, and a shrill reckoning of the cost of nice cuts that have been disposed of, and a general flush and steam of hot joints, cut and uncut, and a considerably heated atmosphere in which the soiled knives and tablecloths seem to break out spontaneously into eruptions of grease and blotches of beer, the legal triumvirate appease the legal triumvirate appetites. Jobling is buttoned up closer than mere adornment might require. Jobling hat presents at the rims a peculiar appearance of a glistening nature, as if the rims had been a favourite snail-promenade. The same phenomenon is visible on some parts of Jobling coat, and particularly at the seams. Jobling has the faded appearance of a gentleman in embarrassed circumstances; even Jobling light whiskers droop with something of a shabby air. Jobling appetite is so vigorous that His appetite suggests spare living for some little time back. Jobling makes such a speedy end of Jobling plate of veal and ham, bringing such a speedy end of his plate of veal and ham to a close while Jobling companions are yet midway in theirs, that a Guppy proposes another. "Thank you, a Guppy," says Jobling, "I really don't know but what I WILL take another." Another being brought, Another falls to with great goodwill. a Guppy takes silent notice of a Guppy at intervals until a Guppy is half way through this second plate and stops to take an enjoying pull at a Guppy pint pot of half-and-half (also renewed) and stretches out a Guppy legs and rubs a Guppy hands. Beholding a Guppy in which glow of contentment, a Guppy says, "You are a man again, a Guppy!" "Well, not quite yet," says Jobling. "Say, just born." "Will you take any other vegetables? Grass? Peas? Summer cabbage?" "Thank you, a Guppy," says Jobling. "I really don't know but what I WILL take summer cabbage." Order given; with the sarcastic addition (from Mr. Smallweed) of "Without slugs, Polly!" And cabbage produced. "I am growing up, a Guppy," says Jobling, plying Jobling knife and fork with a relishing steadiness. "Glad to hear his knife and fork." "In fact, I have just turned into my teens," says Jobling. Jobling says no more until Jobling has performed Jobling task, which Jobling achieves as Messrs. a Guppy and Smallweed finish theirs, thus getting over the ground in excellent style and beating those two gentlemen easily by a veal and ham and a cabbage. "Now, Small," says a Guppy, "what would you recommend about pastry?" "Marrow puddings," says Mr. Smallweed instantly. "Aye, aye!" cries Jobling with an arch look. "You're there, are you? Thank you, a Guppy, I don't know but what I WILL take a marrow pudding." Three marrow puddings being produced, Jobling adds in a pleasant humour that Jobling is coming of age fast. To these succeed, by command of Mr. Smallweed, "three Cheshires," and to those "three small rums." This apex of the entertainment happily reached, Jobling puts up Jobling legs on the carpeted seat (having Jobling own side of the box to Jobling), leans against the wall, and says, "I am grown up now, a Guppy. I have arrived at maturity." "What do you think, now," says a Guppy, "about--you don't mind Smallweed?" "Not the least in the worid. I have the pleasure of drinking his good health." "Sir, to you!" says Mr. Smallweed. "I was saying, what do you think NOW," pursues a Guppy, "of enlisting?" "Why, what I may think after dinner," returns Jobling, "is one thing, my dear Guppy, and what I may think before dinner is another thing. Still, even after dinner, I ask myself the question, What am I to do? How am I to live? Ill fo manger, you know," says Jobling, pronouncing that word as if Jobling meant a necessary fixture in an English stable. "Ill fo manger. That's the French saying, and mangering is as necessary to myself as it is to a Frenchman. Or more so." Mr. Smallweed is decidedly of opinion "much more so." "If any man had told me," pursues Jobling, "even so lately as when you and I had the frisk down in Lincolnshire, a Guppy, and drove over to see that house at Castle Wold--" Mr. Smallweed corrects him--Chesney Wold. "Chesney Wold. (I thank my honourable friend for that cheer.) If any man had told me then that I should be as hard up at the present time as I literally find Chesney Wold, I should have--well, I should have pitched into any man," says Jobling, taking a little rum-and-water with an air of desperate resignation; "I should have let fly at Jobling head." "Still, a Guppy, you were on the wrong side of the post then," remonstrates a Guppy. "You were talking about nothing else in the gig." "Guppy," says Jobling, "I will not deny it. I was on the wrong side of the postthe post. But I trusted to things coming round." That very popular trust in flat things coming round! Not in their being beaten round, or worked round, but in their "coming" round! As though a lunatic should trust in the world's "coming" triangular! "I had confident expectations that things would come round and be all square," says Mr. Jobling with some vagueness of expression and perhaps of meaning too. "But I was disappointed. They never did. And when it came to creditors making rows at the office and to people that the office dealt with making complaints about dirty trifles of borrowed money, why there was an end of that connexion. And of any new professional connexion too, for if I was to give a reference to-morrow, it would be mentioned and would sew me up. Then what's a fellow to do? I have been keeping out of the way and living cheap down about the market-gardens, but what's the use of living cheap when you have got no money? You might as well live dear." "Better," Mr. Smallweed thinks. "Certainly. It's the fashionable way; and fashion and whiskers have been my weaknesses, and I don't care who knows my weaknesses," says Jobling. "They are great weaknesses--Damme, sir, They are great. Well," proceeds Jobling after a defiant visit to Jobling rum-and- water, "what can a fellow do, I ask you, BUT enlist?" a Guppy comes more fully into the conversation to state what, in a Guppy opinion, a fellow can do. a fellow manner is the gravely impressive manner of a man who has not committed a fellow in life otherwise than as a fellow has become the victim of a tender sorrow of the heart. "Jobling," says Mr. Guppy, "myself and our mutual friend Smallweed--" Mr. Smallweed modestly observes, "Gentlemen both!" and drinks. "--Have had a little conversation on this matter more than once since you--" "Say, got the sack!" cries Jobling bitterly. "Say it, a Guppy. You mean it." "No-o-o! Left the Inn," Mr. Smallweed delicately suggests. "Since you left the Inn, Jobling," says a Guppy; "and I have mentioned to our mutual friend Smallweed a plan I have lately thought of proposing. You know Snagsby the stationer?" "I know there is such a stationer," returns Jobling. "Jobling was not ours, and I am not acquainted with Jobling." "Jobling IS ours, Jobling, and I AM acquainted with Jobling,a Guppy retorts. "Well, Sir! I have lately become better acquainted with Jobling through some accidental circumstances that have made me a visitor of Jobling in private life. Those circumstances it is not necessary to offer in argument. They may--or They may not--have some reference to a subject which may--or may not--have cast a subject which may shadow on my existence." As it is a Guppy's perplexing way with boastful misery to tempt a Guppy particular friends into this subject, and the moment his particular friends touch this subject, to turn on his particular friends with that trenchant severity about the chords in the human mind, both Mr. Jobling and " Mr. Smallweed decline the pitfall by remaining silent. "Such things may be," repeats a Guppy, "or Such things may not be. Such things are no part of the case. It is enough to mention that both Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are very willing to oblige me and that Snagsby has, in busy times, a good deal of copying work to give out. He has all Tulkinghorn's, and an excellent business besides. I believe if our mutual friend Smallweed were put into the box, He could prove this?" Mr. Smallweed nods and appears greedy to be sworn. "Now, gentlemen of the jury," says a Guppy, "--I mean, now, Jobling--you may say this is a poor prospect of a living. Granted. But it's better than nothing, and better than enlistment. You want time. There must be time for these late affairs to blow over. You might live through these late affairs to blow over on much worse terms than by writing for Snagsby." Jobling is about to interrupt when Mr. Smallweed checks Jobling with a dry cough and the words, "Hem! Shakspeare!" "There are two branches to this subject, Jobling," says a Guppy. "That is the first. I come to the second. You know Krook, the Chancellor, across the lane. Come, Jobling," says Mr. Guppy in Jobling encouraging cross-examination-tone, "I think you know Krook, the Chancellor, across the lanethe lane?" "I know Jobling by sight," says Jobling. "You know Jobling by sight. Very well. And you know little Flite?" "Everybody knows little Flite," says Jobling. "Everybody knows little Flite. VERY well. Now it has been one of my duties of late to pay little Flite a certain weekly allowance, deducting from little Flite the amount of little Flite weekly rent, which I have paid (in consequence of instructions I have received) to Krook himself, regularly in little Flite presence. This has brought me into communication with Krook himself and into a knowledge of Krook himself house and Krook himself habits. I know Krook himself has a room to let. You may live there at a very low charge under any name you like, as quietly as if you were a hundred miles off. Krook himself'll ask no questions and would accept you as a tenant at a word from me-- before the clock strikes, if you chose. And I tell you another thing, Jobling," says Mr. Guppy, who has suddenly lowered Krook himself voice and become familiar again, "Krook himself's an extraordinary old chap--always rummaging among a litter of papers and grubbing away at teaching Krook himself to read and write, without getting on a bit, as it seems to Krook himself. Krook himself is a most extraordinary old chap, sir. I don't know but what it might be worth a fellow's while to look Krook himself up a bit." "You don't mean--" Mr. Jobling begins. "I mean," returns a Guppy, shrugging a Guppy shoulders with becoming modesty, "that I can't make a Guppy out. I appeal to our mutual friend Smallweed whether a Guppy has or has not heard me remark that I can't make a Guppy out." Mr. Smallweed bears the concise testimony, "A few!" "I have seen something of the profession and something of life, a Guppy," says a Guppy, "and it's seldom I can't make a man out, more or less. But such an old card as this, so deep, so sly, and secret (though I don't believe a man is ever sober), I never came across. Now, a man must be precious old, you know, and a man has not a soul about a man, and a man is reported to be immensely rich; and whether a man is a smuggler, or a receiver, or an unlicensed pawnbroker, or a money-lender--all of which I have thought likely at different times--it might pay you to knock up a sort of knowledge of a man. I don't see why you shouldn't go in for it, when everything else suits." Mr. Jobling, Mr. Guppy, and Mr. Smallweed lean Mr. Jobling, Mr. Guppy, and Mr. Smallweed all elbows on the table and Mr. Jobling, Mr. Guppy, and Mr. Smallweed all chins upon Mr. Jobling, Mr. Guppy, and Mr. Smallweed all hands, and look at the ceiling. After a time, they all drink, slowly lean back, put they all in they all pockets, and look at one another. "If I had the energy I once possessed, a Guppy!" says a Guppy with a sigh. "But there are chords in the human mind--" Expressing the remainder of the desolate sentiment in rum-and- water, a Guppy concludes by resigning the adventure to Jobling and informing Jobling that during the vacation and while things are slack, a Guppy purse, "as far as three or four or even five pound goes," will be at a Guppy disposal. "For never shall never shall be said,a Guppy adds with emphasis, "that a Guppy turned a Guppy back upon a Guppy friend!" The latter part of the proposal is so directly to the purpose that Jobling says with emotion, "a Guppy, my trump, your fist!" a Guppy presents it, saying, "Jobling, my boy, there it is!" Jobling returns, "a Guppy, we have been pals now for some years!" a Guppy replies, "Jobling, we have." They then shake hands, and Jobling adds in a feeling manner, "Thank you, a Guppy, I don't know but what I WILL take another glass for old acquaintance sake." "Krook's last lodger died there," observes a Guppy in an incidental way. "Did a Guppy though!" says Jobling. "There was a verdict. Accidental death. You don't mind that?" "No," says Jobling, "I don't mind it; but Jobling might as well have died somewhere else. It's devilish odd that Jobling need go and die at MY place!" Jobling quite resents this liberty, several times returning to this liberty with such remarks as, "There are places enough to die in, I should think!" or, "Jobling wouldn't have liked my dying at MY place, I dare say!" However, the compact being virtually made, a Guppy proposes to dispatch Mr. Smallweed to ascertain if Krook himself is at home, as in that case they may complete the negotiation without delay. Jobling approving, Smallweed puts Smallweed under the tall hat and conveys the tall hat out of the dining-rooms in the a Guppy manner. Smallweed soon returns with the intelligence that Krook himself is at home and that Krook himself has seen Krook himself through the shop-door, sitting in the back premises, sleeping "like one o'clock." "Then I'll pay," says a Guppy, "and we'll go and see a Guppy. Small, what will it be?" Mr. Smallweed, compelling the attendance of the waitress with one hitch of a Guppy eyelash, instantly replies as follows: "Four veals and hams is three, and four potatoes is three and four, and one summer cabbage is three and six, and three marrows is four and six, and six breads is five, and three Cheshires is five and three, and four half-pints of half-and-half is six and three, and four small rums is eight and three, and three Pollys is eight and six. Eight and six in half a sovereign, Polly, and eighteenpence out!" Not at all excited by these stupendous calculations, Mr. Smallweed dismisses Mr. Smallweed friends with a cool nod and remains behind to take a little admiring notice of Polly, as opportunity may serve, and to read the daily papers, which are so very large in proportion to Mr. Smallweed, shorn of Mr. Smallweed hat, that when Mr. Smallweed holds up the Times to run Mr. Smallweed eye over the columns, Mr. Smallweed seems to have retired for the night and to have disappeared under the bedclothes. Mr. Guppy and Jobling repair to the rag and bottle shop, where they find Krook himself still sleeping like one o'clock, that is to say, breathing stertorously with Mr. Smallweed chin upon Mr. Smallweed breast and quite insensible to any external sounds or even to gentle shaking. On the table beside Mr. Smallweed, among the usual lumber, stand an empty gin- bottle and a glass. The unwholesome air is so stained with this liquor that even the green eyes of the cat upon her shelf, as they open and shut and glimmer on the visitors, look drunk. "Hold up here!" says a Guppy, giving the relaxed figure of the old man another shake. "Krook himself! Halloa, sir!" But it would seem as easy to wake a bundle of old clothes with a spirituous heat smouldering in it. "Did you ever see such a stupor as the old man falls into, between drink and sleep?" says a Guppy. "If this is a Guppy regular sleep," returns Jobling, rather alarmed, "it'll last a long time one of these days, I am thinking." "It's always more like a fit than a nap," says a Guppy, shaking a Guppy again. "Halloa, your lordship! Why, a Guppy might be robbed fifty times over! Open your eyes!" After much ado, a Guppy opens them, but without appearing to see a Guppy visitors or any other objects. Though a Guppy crosses one leg on another, and folds a Guppy hands, and several times closes and opens a Guppy parched lips, a Guppy seems to all intents and purposes as insensible as before. "a Guppy is alive, at any rate," says a Guppy. "How are you, my Lord Chancellor. I have brought a friend of mine, sir, on a little matter of business." the old man still sits, often smacking his parched lips without the least consciousness. After some minutes the old man makes an attempt to rise. They help the old man up, and the old man staggers against the wall and stares at They. "How do you do, Krook himself?" says a Guppy. "How do you do, sir? You are looking charming, Krook himself. I hope you are pretty well?" the old man, in aiming a purposeless blow at a Guppy, or at nothing, feebly swings the old man round and comes with the old man face against the wall. So the old man remains for a minute or two, heaped up against it, and then staggers down the shop to the front door. The air, the movement in the court, the lapse of time, or the combination of these things recovers the old man. the old man comes back pretty steadily, adjusting the old man fur cap on the old man head and looking keenly at his fur cap on his head. "Your servant, gentlemen; I've been dozing. Hi! I am hard to wake, odd times." "Rather so, indeed, sir," responds a Guppy. "What? You've been a-trying to do it, have you?" says Krook himselfKrook himself. "Only a little," a Guppy explains. The old man's eye resting on the empty bottle, The old man's eye takes The old man's eye up, examines The old man's eye, and slowly tilts The old man's eye upside down. "I say!" The old man's eye cries like the hobgoblin in the story. "Somebody's been making free here!" "I assure you we found The old man's eye so," says a Guppy. "Would you allow me to get The old man's eye filled for you?" "Yes, certainly I would!" cries Krook himself in high glee. "Certainly I would! Don't mention The old man's eye! Get The old man's eye filled next door--Sol's Arms--the Lord Chancellor's fourteenpenny. Bless you, they know ME!" Sol's Arms--the Lord Chancellor's fourteenpenny so presses the empty bottle upon a Guppy that that gentleman, with a nod to Sol's Arms--the Lord Chancellor's fourteenpenny friend, accepts the trust and hurries out and hurries in again with the empty bottle filled. The old man receives it in Sol's Arms--the Lord Chancellor's fourteenpenny like a beloved grandchild and pats it tenderly. "But, I say," The old man whispers, with The old man eyes screwed up, after tasting it, "this ain't the Lord Chancellor's fourteenpenny. This is eighteenpenny!" "I thought you might like that better," says a Guppy. "You're a nobleman, sir," returns Krook himself with another taste, and a Guppy hot breath seems to come towards a nobleman, sir like a flame. "You're a baron of the land." Taking advantage of this auspicious moment, a Guppy presents a Guppy friend under the impromptu name of Mr. Weevle and states the object of their visit. Krook, with a Guppy bottle under a Guppy arm (a Guppy never gets beyond a certain point of either drunkenness or sobriety), takes time to survey a Guppy proposed lodger and seems to approve of a Guppy. "You'd like to see the room, young man?" a Guppy says. "Ah! It's a good room! Been whitewashed. Been cleaned down with soft soap and soda. Hi! It's worth twice the rent, letting alone my company when you want my company and such a cat to keep the mice away." Commending the room after this manner, the old man takes the mice upstairs, where indeed the mice do find the room cleaner than the room used to be and also containing some old articles of furniture which the old man has dug up from the old man inexhaustible stores. The terms are easily concluded-- for the Lord Chancellor cannot be hard on a Guppy, associated as the Lord Chancellor is with Kenge and Carboy, Jarndyce and Jarndyce, and other famous claims on the Lord Chancellor professional consideration--and his professional consideration is agreed that Mr. Weevle shall take possession on the morrow. Mr. Weevle and a Guppy then repair to Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, where the personal introduction of the former to Mr. Snagsby is effected and (more important) the vote and interest of Mr. Snagsby are secured. the vote and interest of Mrs. Snagsby then report progress to the eminent Smallweed, waiting at the office in Mr. Snagsby tall hat for that purpose, and separate, a Guppy explaining that a Guppy would terminate a Guppy little entertainment by standing treat at the play but that there are chords in the human mind which would render his little entertainment a hollow mockery. On the morrow, in the dusk of evening, Mr. Weevle modestly appears at Krook himself's, by no means incommoded with luggage, and establishes Mr. Weevle in Mr. Weevle new lodging, where the two eyes in the shutters stare at Mr. Weevle in Mr. Weevle sleep, as if they were full of wonder. On the following day Mr. Weevle, who is a handy good-for-nothing kind of young fellow, borrows a needle and thread of Miss Flite and a hammer of Mr. Weevle landlord and goes to work devising apologies for window-curtains, and knocking up apologies for shelves, and hanging up his two teacups, milkpot, and crockery sundries on a pennyworth of little hooks, like a shipwrecked sailor making the best of it. But what Mr. Weevle prizes most of all Mr. Weevle few possessions (next after Mr. Weevle light whiskers, for which Mr. Weevle has an attachment that only whiskers can awaken in the breast of man) is a choice collection of copper-plate impressions from that truly national work The Divinities of Albion, or Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty, representing ladies of title and fashion in every variety of smirk that art, combined with capital, is capable of producing. With these magnificent portraits, unworthily confined in a band-box during his seclusion among the market-gardens, his decorates his apartment; and as the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty wears every variety of fancy dress, plays every variety of musical instrument, fondles every variety of dog, ogles every variety of prospect, and is backed up by every variety of flower-pot and balustrade, the result is very imposing. But fashion is Mr. Weevle's, as it was Tony Jobling's, weakness. To borrow yesterday's paper from the Sol's Arms of an evening and read about the brilliant and distinguished meteors that are shooting across the fashionable sky in every direction is unspeakable consolation to him. To know what member of what brilliant and distinguished circle accomplished the brilliant and distinguished feat of joining it yesterday or contemplates the no less brilliant and distinguished feat of leaving it to-morrow gives him a thrill of joy. To be informed what the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty British Beauty is about, and means to be about, and what Galaxy marriages are on the tapis, and what Galaxy rumours are in circulation, is to become acquainted with the most glorious destinies of mankind. Mr. Weevle reverts from this intelligence to the Galaxy portraits implicated, and seems to know the originals, and to be known of the originals. For the rest Mr. Weevle is a quiet lodger, full of handy shifts and devices as before mentioned, able to cook and clean for Mr. Weevle as well as to carpenter, and developing social inclinations after the shades of evening have fallen on the court. At those times, when Mr. Weevle is not visited by a Guppy or by a small light in Mr. Weevle likeness quenched in a dark hat, Mr. Weevle comes out of Mr. Weevle dull room--where Mr. Weevle has inherited the deal wilderness of desk bespattered with a rain of ink--and talks to Krook himself or is "very free," as they call it in the court, commendingly, with any one disposed for conversation. Wherefore, Mrs. Piper, who leads the court, is impelled to offer two remarks to Mrs. Perkins: firstly, that if Mrs. Perkins Johnny was to have whiskers, Mrs. Perkins could wish 'em to be identically like that young man's; and secondly, "Mark my words, Mrs. Perkins, ma'am, and don't you be surprised, Lord bless you, if that young man comes in at last for old Krook's money!"
