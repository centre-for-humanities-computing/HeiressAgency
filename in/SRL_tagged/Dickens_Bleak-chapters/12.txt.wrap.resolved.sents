Our Dear Brother A touch on the lawyer's wrinkled hand as the lawyer stands in the dark room, irresolute, makes the lawyer start and say, "What's that?"
"It's me," returns the old man of the house, whose breath is in his ear.
"Can't you wake his?"
"No."
"What have you done with your candle?"
"It's gone out.
Here It is."
Krook takes it, goes to the fire, stoops over the red embers, and tries to get a light.
The dying ashes have no light to spare, and his endeavours are vain.
Muttering, after an ineffectual call to his lodger, that his will go downstairs and bring a lighted candle from the shop, his departs.
Mr. Tulkinghorn, for some new reason that Mr. Tulkinghorn has, does not await Mr. Tulkinghorn return in the room, but on the stairs outside.
a light soon shines upon the wall, as Krook comes slowly up with Mr. Tulkinghorn green-eyed cat following at Mr. Tulkinghorn heels.
"Does his generally sleep like this?"
inquired the lawyer in a low voice.
"Hi!
I don't know," says Krook, shaking his head and lifting his eyebrows.
"I know next to nothing of his habits except that his keeps his very close."
Thus whispering, they both go in together.
As a light goes in, the great eyes in the shutters, darkening, seem to close.
Not so the eyes upon the bed.
"God save us!"
exclaims Mr. Tulkinghorn.
"Mr. Tulkinghorn is dead!"
Krook drops the heavy hand Mr. Tulkinghorn has taken up so suddenly that the arm swings over the bedside.
They look at one another for a moment.
"Send for some doctor!
Call for Miss Flite up the stairs, sir.
Here's poison by the bed!
Call out for Miss Flite, will you?"
says Krook, with Krook lean hands spread out above the body like a vampire's wings.
Mr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing and calls, "Miss Flite!
Flite!
Make haste, here, whoever you are!
Flite!"
Krook follows Mr. Tulkinghorn with Mr. Tulkinghorn eyes, and while Mr. Tulkinghorn is calling, finds opportunity to steal to the old portmanteau and steal back again.
"Run, Miss Flite, run!
The nearest doctor!
Run!"
So Krook addresses a crazy little woman who is Krook female lodger, who appears and vanishes in a breath, who soon returns accompanied by a testy medical man brought from Krook dinner, with a broad, snuffy upper lip and a broad Scotch tongue.
"Ey!
Bless the hearts o' ye," says a testy medical man brought from his dinner, looking up at the hearts after a moment's examination.
"a testy medical man brought from his dinner's just as dead as Phairy!"
Mr. Tulkinghorn inquires if Mr. Tulkinghorn has been dead any time.
"Any time, sir?"
says the medical gentleman.
"It's probable Mr. Tulkinghorn wull have been dead aboot three hours."
"About that time, I should say," observes a dark young man on the other side of the bed.
"Air you in the maydickle prayfession yourself, sir?"
inquires the first.
a dark young man on the other side of the bed says yes.
"Then I'll just tak' my depairture," replies the other, "for I'm nae gude here!"
With which remark a dark young man on the other side of the bed finishes a dark young man on the other side of the bed brief attendance and returns to finish a dark young man on the other side of the bed .
The dark young surgeon passes the candle across and across the face and carefully examines the law-writer, who has established The dark young surgeon pretensions to The dark young surgeon name by becoming indeed No one.
"I knew this person by sight very well," says this person.
"this person has purchased opium of this person for the last year and a half.
Was anybody present related to this person?"
glancing round upon the three bystanders.
"I was this person landlord," grimly answers Krook, taking the candle from The dark young surgeon's outstretched hand.
"this person told me once I was the nearest relation this person had."
"this person has died," says the surgeon, "of an over-dose of opium, there is no doubt.
The room is strongly flavoured with The room.
There is enough here now," taking an old tea-pot from Krook, "to kill a dozen people."
"Do you think this person did it on purpose?"
asks Krook.
"Took the over-dose?"
"Yes!"
Krook almost smacks Krook lips with the unction of a horrible interest.
"I can't say.
I should think it unlikely, as Krook has been in the habit of taking so much.
But nobody can tell.
this person was very poor, I suppose?"
"I suppose this person was.
this person room--don't look rich," says Krook, who might have changed eyes with this person cat, as this person casts this person sharp glance around.
"But I have never been in it since this person had it, and this person was too close to name this person circumstances to me."
"Did this person owe you any rent?"
"Six weeks."
"this person will never pay it!"
says this person, resuming this person examination.
"It is beyond a doubt that this person is indeed as dead as Pharaoh; and to judge from this person appearance and condition, I should think it a happy release.
Yet this person must have been a good figure when a youth, and I dare say, good-looking."
this person says this, not unfeelingly, while sitting on the bedstead's edge with this person face towards that other face and this person hand upon the region of the heart.
"I recollect once thinking there was something in his manner, uncouth as it was, that denoted a fall in life.
Was that so?"
his continues, looking round.
Krook replies, "You might as well ask me to describe the ladies whose heads of hair I have got in sacks downstairs.
Than that his was my lodger for a year and a half and lived--or didn't live--by law-writing, I know no more of his."
During this dialogue his has stood aloof by the old portmanteau, with his hands behind his, equally removed, to all appearance, from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the bed--from the young surgeon's professional interest in death, noticeable as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as an individual; from the old man's unction; and the little crazy woman's awe.
his imperturbable face has been as inexpressive as his rusty clothes.
One could not even say his has been thinking all this while.
his has shown neither patience nor impatience, nor attention nor abstraction.
his has shown nothing but his shell.
As easily might the tone of a delicate musical instrument be inferred from its case, as the tone of his from its case.
his now interposes, addressing the young surgeon in his unmoved, professional way.
"I looked in here," his observes, "just before you, with the intention of giving this deceased man, whom I never saw alive, some employment at his trade of copying.
I had heard of his from my stationer--Snagsby of Cook's Court.
Since no one here knows anything about his, it might be as well to send for Snagsby.
Ah!"
to the little crazy woman, who has often seen his in court, and whom his has often seen, and who proposes, in frightened dumb-show, to go for the law-stationer.
"Suppose you do!"
While she is gone, the surgeon abandons the surgeon hopeless investigation and covers the surgeon subject with the patchwork counterpane.
Mr. Krook and he interchange a word or two.
his says nothing, but stands, ever, near the old portmanteau.
Snagsby arrives hastily in Snagsby grey coat and Snagsby black sleeves.
"Dear me, dear me," Snagsby says; "and it has come to this, has it!
Bless my soul!"
"Can you give the person of the house any information about this unfortunate creature, Snagsby?"
inquires his.
"his was in arrears with his rent, it seems.
And his must be buried, you know."
"Well, sir," says Snagsby, coughing Snagsby apologetic cough behind Snagsby hand, "I really don't know what advice I could offer, except sending for the beadle."
"I don't speak of advice," returns his.
"I could advise--" "No one better, sir, I am sure," says Snagsby, with Snagsby deferential cough.
"I speak of affording some clue to Snagsby connexions, or to where Snagsby came from, or to anything concerning Snagsby."
"I assure you, sir," says Snagsby after prefacing Snagsby reply with Snagsby cough of general propitiation, "that I no more know where Snagsby came from than I know--" "Where Snagsby has gone to, perhaps," suggests the surgeon to help Snagsby out.
A pause.
his looking at the law-stationer.
Mr. Krook, with his mouth open, looking for somebody to speak next.
"As to his connexions, sir," says Snagsby, "if a person was to say to Snagsby, 'Snagsby, here's twenty thousand pound down, ready for Snagsby in the Bank of England if you'll only name one of 'em,' I couldn't do it, sir!
About a year and a half ago--to the best of my belief, at the time when he first came to lodge at the present rag and bottle shop--" "That was the time!"
says Krook with a nod.
"About a year and a half ago," says Snagsby, strengthened, "Snagsby came into our place one morning after breakfast, and finding my little woman (which I name Mrs. Snagsby when I use that appellation) in our shop, produced a specimen of Snagsby handwriting and gave Mrs. Snagsby to understand that Snagsby was in want of copying work to do and was, not to put too fine a point upon it," a favourite apology for plain speaking with Mr. Snagsby, which Snagsby always offers with a sort of argumentative frankness, "hard up!
Mrs. Snagsby is not in general partial to strangers, particular--not to put too fine a point upon it--when strangers, particular-- want anything.
But Mrs. Snagsby was rather took by something about this person, whether by this person being unshaved, or by this person hair being in want of attention, or by what other ladies' reasons, I leave you to judge; and Mrs. Snagsby accepted of the specimen, and likewise of the address.
Mrs. Snagsby hasn't a good ear for names," proceeds Snagsby after consulting Snagsby cough of consideration behind Snagsby hand, "and Mrs. Snagsby considered Nemo equally the same as Nimrod.
In consequence of which, Mrs. Snagsby got into a habit of saying to Mrs. Snagsby at meals, 'Snagsby, you haven't found Nimrod any work yet!'
or 'Snagsby, why didn't you give that eight and thirty Chancery folio in Jarndyce to Nimrod?'
or such like.
And that is the way Snagsby gradually fell into job-work at our place; and that is the most I know of Snagsby except that Snagsby was a quick hand, and a hand not sparing of night-work, and that if you gave Snagsby out, say, five and forty folio on the Wednesday night, you would have it brought in on the Thursday morning.
All of which--" Mr. Snagsby concludes by politely motioning with Snagsby hat towards the bed, as much as to add, "I have no doubt my honourable friend would confirm if Snagsby were in a condition to do it."
"Hadn't you better see," says his to Krook, "whether his had any papers that may enlighten you?
There will be an inquest, and you will be asked the question.
You can read?"
"No, I can't," returns the old man with a sudden grin. "
Mr. Snagsby," says his, "look over the room for the old man.
the old man will get into some trouble or difficulty otherwise.
Being here, I'll wait if you make haste, and then I can testify on the old man behalf, if it should ever be necessary, that all was fair and right.
If you will hold the candle for Mr. Snagsby, my friend, the old man'll soon see whether there is anything to help you."
"In the first place, here's an old portmanteau, sir," says Snagsby.
Ah, to be sure, so there is!
his does not appear to have seen it before, though his is standing so close to it, and though there is very little else, heaven knows.
The marine-store merchant holds the light, and the law-stationer conducts the search.
the surgeon leans against the corner of the chimney-piece; Miss Flite peeps and trembles just within the door.
The apt old scholar of the old school, with the surgeon dull black breeches tied with ribbons at the knees, the surgeon large black waistcoat, the surgeon long- sleeved black coat, and the surgeon wisp of limp white neckerchief tied in the bow the peerage knows so well, stands in exactly the same place and attitude.
There are some worthless articles of clothing in the old portmanteau; there is a bundle of pawnbrokers' duplicates, those turnpike tickets on the road of poverty; there is a crumpled paper, smelling of opium, on which are scrawled rough memoranda--as, took, such a day, so many grains; took, such another day, so many more-- begun some time ago, as if with the intention of being regularly continued, but soon left off.
There are a few dirty scraps of newspapers, all referring to coroners' inquests; there is nothing else.
coroners' inquests search the cupboard and the drawer of the ink-splashed table.
There is not a morsel of an old letter or of any other writing in either.
the surgeon examines the dress on the law- writer.
A knife and some odd halfpence are all the surgeon finds.
Snagsby's suggestion is the practical suggestion after all, and the beadle must be called in.
So the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle, and the rest come out of the room.
"Don't leave the cat there!"
says the surgeon; "that won't do!"
Krook therefore drives Krook out before Krook, and Krook goes furtively downstairs, winding Krook lithe tail and licking Krook lips.
"Good night!"
says his, and goes home to Allegory and meditation.
By this time the news has got into the court.
Groups of the court inhabitants assemble to discuss the thing, and the outposts of the army of observation (principally boys) are pushed forward to Krook's window, which Groups of its inhabitants closely invest.
A policeman has already walked up to the room, and walked down again to the door, where A policeman stands like a tower, only condescending to see the boys at A policeman base occasionally; but whenever A policeman does see the boys at his base, the boys at his base quail and fall back.
Mrs. Perkins, who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms with Mrs. Piper in consequence for an unpleasantness originating in young Perkins' having "fetched" young Piper "a crack," renews Mrs. Piper friendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion.
The potboy at the corner, who is a privileged amateur, as possessing official knowledge of life and having to deal with drunken men occasionally, exchanges confidential communications with A policeman and has the appearance of an impregnable youth, unassailable by truncheons and unconfinable in station-houses.
People talk across the court out of window, and bare-headed scouts come hurrying in from Chancery Lane to know what's the matter.
The general feeling seems to be that it's a blessing Krook warn't made away with first, mingled with a little natural disappointment that Krook was not.
In the midst of this sensation, the beadle arrives.
the beadle, though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a ridiculous institution, is not without a certain popularity for the moment, if it were only as a man who is going to see the body.
A policeman considers him an imbecile civilian, a remnant of the barbarous watchmen times, but gives him admission as something that must be borne with until government shall abolish him.
The sensation is heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the beadle is on the ground and has gone in.
By and by the beadle comes out, once more intensifying the sensation, which has rather languished in the interval.
the beadle is understood to be in want of witnesses for the inquest to-morrow who can tell the coroner and jury anything whatever respecting the deceased.
Is immediately referred to innumerable people who can tell nothing whatever.
Is made more imbecile by being constantly informed that Mrs. Green's son "was a law-writer his-self and knowed Mrs. Green's son better than anybody," which son of Mrs. Green's appears, on inquiry, to be at the present time aboard a vessel bound for China, three months out, but considered accessible by telegraph on application to the Lords of the Admiralty.
the beadle goes into various shops and parlours, examining the inhabitants, always shutting the door first, and by exclusion, delay, and general idiotcy exasperating the public.
A policeman seen to smile to potboy.
Public loses interest and undergoes reaction.
Taunts the beadle in shrill youthful voices with having boiled a boy, choruses fragments of a popular song to that effect and importing that a boy was made into soup for the workhouse.
Policeman at last finds it necessary to support the law and seize a vocalist, who is released upon the flight of the rest on condition of the beadle getting out of this then, come, and cutting this--a condition the beadle immediately observes.
So the sensation dies off for the time; and the unmoved policeman (to whom a little opium, more or less, is nothing), with the beadle shining hat, stiff stock, inflexible great-coat, stout belt and bracelet, and all things fitting, pursues the beadle lounging way with a heavy tread, beating the palms of the beadle white gloves one against the other and stopping now and then at a street-corner to look casually about for anything between a lost child and a murder.
Under cover of the night, the beadle comes flitting about Chancery Lane with the beadle summonses, in which every juror's name is wrongly spelt, and nothing rightly spelt but the beadle's own name, which nobody can read or wants to know.
his summonses, in which every juror's name is wrongly spelt served and the beadle witnesses forewarned, the beadle goes to Krook's to keep a small appointment Krook has made with certain paupers, who, presently arriving, are conducted upstairs, where his witnesses leave the great eyes in the shutter something new to stare at, in that last shape which earthly lodgings take for No one--and for Every one.
And all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau; and the lonely figure on the bed, whose path in life has lain through five and forty years, lies there with no more track behind the beadle that any one can trace than a deserted infant.
Next day the court is all alive--is like a fair, as Mrs. Perkins, more than reconciled to Mrs. Piper, says in amicable conversation with that excellent woman.
the coroner is to sit in the first-floor room at the Sol's Arms, where the Harmonic Meetings take place twice a week and where the chair is filled by a gentleman of professional celebrity, faced by Little Swills, the comic vocalist, who hopes (according to the bill in the window) that his friends will rally round his and support first-rate talent.
the Sol's Arms does a brisk stroke of business all the morning.
Even children so require sustaining under the general excitement that a pieman who has established himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says himself brandy-balls go off like smoke.
What time the beadle, hovering between the door of Krook's establishment and the door of The Sol's Arms, shows the curiosity in Krook keeping to a few discreet spirits and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in return.
At the appointed hour arrives the coroner, for whom the jurymen are waiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good dry skittle-ground attached to The Sol's Arms.
the coroner, for whom the jurymen are waiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good dry skittle-ground attached to the Sol's Arms frequents more public-houses than any man alive.
The smell of sawdust, beer, tobacco-smoke, and spirits is inseparable in Krook vocation from death in its most awful shapes.
Krook is conducted by the beadle and the landlord to the Harmonic Meeting Room, where Krook puts Krook hat on the piano and takes a Windsor-chair at the head of a long table formed of several short tables put together and ornamented with glutinous rings in endless involutions, made by pots and glasses.
As many of the jury as can crowd together at the table sit there.
The rest get among the spittoons and pipes or lean against the piano.
Over the coroner, for whom the jurymen are waiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good dry skittle-ground attached to the Sol's Arms's head is a small iron garland, the pendant handle of a bell, which rather gives the majesty of the court the appearance of going to be hanged presently.
Call over and swear the jury!
While the ceremony is in progress, sensation is created by the entrance of a chubby little man in a large shirt-collar, with a moist eye and an inflamed nose, who modestly takes a position near the door as one of the general public, but seems familiar with the room too.
A whisper circulates that this is Little Swills.
this is considered not unlikely that he will get up an imitation of the coroner, for whom the jurymen are waiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good dry skittle-ground attached to the Sol's Arms and make an imitation of the coroner the principal feature of the Harmonic Meeting in the evening.
"Well, gentlemen--" the coroner, for whom the jurymen are waiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good dry skittle-ground attached to the Sol's Arms begins.
"Silence there, will you!"
says the beadle.
Not to the coroner, for whom the jurymen are waiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good dry skittle-ground attached to the Sol's Arms, though the coroner, for whom the jurymen are waiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good dry skittle-ground attached to the Sol's Arms might appear so.
"Well, gentlemen," resumes the coroner, for whom the jurymen are waiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good dry skittle-ground attached to the Sol's Arms.
"You are impanelled here to inquire into the death of a certain man.
Evidence will be given before you as to the circumstances attending the death of a certain man, and you will give your verdict according to the--skittles; they must be stopped, you know, beadle!--evidence, and not according to anything else.
The first thing to be done is to view the body."
"Make way there!"
cries the beadle.
So they go out in a loose procession, something after the manner of a straggling funeral, and make they inspection in Krook's back second floor, from which a few of the jurymen retire pale and precipitately.
the beadle is very careful that two gentlemen not very neat about the cuffs and buttons (for whose accommodation the beadle has provided a special little table near the coroner in the Harmonic Meeting Room) should see all that is to be seen.
For all that is to be seen are the public chroniclers of such inquiries by the line; and the beadle is not superior to the universal human infirmity, but hopes to read in print what "Mooney, the active and intelligent beadle of the district," said and did and even aspires to see the name of Mooney as familiarly and patronizingly mentioned as the name of the hangman is, according to the latest examples.
Little Swills is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return.
Mr. Tulkinghorn, also.
his is received with distinction and seated near the coroner between that high judicial officer, a bagatelle-board, and the coal-box.
The inquiry proceeds.
The jury learn how the subject of The jury inquiry died, and learn no more about his.
"A very eminent solicitor is in attendance, gentlemen," says the coroner, "who, I am informed, was accidentally present when discovery of the death was made, but A very eminent solicitor could only repeat the evidence you have already heard from the surgeon, the landlord, the lodger, and the law-stationer, and it is not necessary to trouble A very eminent solicitor.
Is anybody in attendance who knows anything more?"
Mrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins.
Mrs. Piper sworn.
Anastasia Piper, gentlemen.
Married woman.
Now, Mrs. Piper, what have you got to say about this?
Why, Mrs. Piper has a good deal to say, chiefly in parentheses and without punctuation, but not much to tell.
Mrs. Piper lives in the court (which Mrs. Piper husband is a cabinet-maker), and it has long been well beknown among the neighbours (counting from the day next but one before the half-baptizing of Alexander James Piper aged eighteen months and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live such was the sufferings gentlemen of that child in her husband gums) as the plaintive--so Mrs. Piper insists on calling the deceased--was reported to have sold Piper.
Thinks it was the plaintive's air in which that report originatinin.
See the plaintive often and considered as Piper air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go about some children being timid (and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins may be brought forard for Mrs. Perkins is here and will do credit to Mrs. Perkins husband and Mrs. Perkins and family).
Has seen the plaintive wexed and worrited by the children (for children children will ever be and you cannot expect children specially if of playful dispositions to be Methoozellers which you was not yourself).
On accounts of this and Piper dark looks has often dreamed as Mrs. Perkins see Piper take a pick-axe from Piper pocket and split Johnny's head (which the child knows not fear and has repeatually called after Piper close at Piper eels).
Never however see the plaintive take a pick-axe or any other wepping far from it.
Has seen Piper hurry away when run and called after as if not partial to children and never see Piper speak to neither child nor grown person at any time (excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing down the lane over the way round the corner which if Piper was here would tell you that Piper has been seen a-speaking to Piper frequent).
Says the coroner, is that boy here?
Says the beadle, no, sir, the beadle is not here.
Says the coroner, go and fetch the beadle then.
In the absence of the active and intelligent, the coroner converses with his.
Oh!
Here's that boy, gentlemen!
Here his is, very muddy, very hoarse, very ragged.
Now, boy!
But stop a minute.
Caution.
that boy must be put through a few preliminary paces.
Name, Jo.
Nothing else that that boy knows on.
Don't know that everybody has two names.
Never heerd of sich a think.
Don't know that Jo is short for a longer name.
Thinks it long enough for that boy.
that boy don't find no fault with it.
Spell it?
No.
that boy can't spell it.
No father, no mother, no friends.
Never been to school.
What's home?
Knows a broom's a broom, and knows it's wicked to tell a lie.
Don't recollect who told that boy about a broom's a broom or about a lie, but knows both.
Can't exactly say what'll be done to that boy arter that boy's dead if that boy tells a lie to the gentlemen here, but believes it'll be something wery bad to punish that boy, and serve that boy right--and so that boy'll tell the truth.
"This won't do, gentlemen!"
says the coroner with a melancholy shake of the coroner's head.
"Don't you think you can receive that boy evidence, sir?"
asks an attentive juryman.
"Out of the question," says the coroner with a melancholy shake of the head.
"You have heard that boy.
'Can't exactly say' won't do, you know.
We can't take THAT in a court of justice, gentlemen.
It's terrible depravity.
Put that boy aside."
Boy put aside, to the great edification of the audience, especially of Little Swills, the comic vocalist.
Now.
Is there any other witness?
No other witness.
Very well, gentlemen!
Here's a man unknown, proved to have been in the habit of taking opium in large quantities for a year and a half, found dead of too much opium.
If you think you have any evidence to lead you to the conclusion that that boy committed suicide, you will come to the conclusion that he committed suicide.
If you think it is a case of accidental death, you will find a verdict accordingly.
Verdict accordingly.
Accidental death.
No doubt.
Gentlemen, you are discharged.
Good afternoon.
While the coroner with a melancholy shake of the head buttons his great-coat, Mr. Tulkinghorn and his give private audience to the rejected witness in a corner.
That graceless creature only knows that the dead man (whom his recognized just now by his yellow face and black hair) was sometimes hooted and pursued about the streets.
That one cold winter night when his, the boy, was shivering in a doorway near his crossing, his turned to look at his, and came back, and having questioned his and found that his had not a friend in the world, said, "Neither have
