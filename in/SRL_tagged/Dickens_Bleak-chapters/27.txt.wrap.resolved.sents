Mrs. Snagsby Sees It All There is disquietude in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street.
Black suspicion hides in that peaceful region.
The mass of Cook's Courtiers are in The mass of Cook's Courtiers usual state of mind, no better and no worse; but Mrs. Snagsby is changed, and Mrs. Snagsby little woman knows it.
For Tom-all-Alone's and Lincoln's Inn Fields persist in harnessing themselves, a pair of ungovernable coursers, to the chariot of Mrs. Snagsby's imagination; and Mr. Bucket drives; and the passengers are Jo and Mr. Tulkinghorn; and the complete equipage whirls though the law-stationery business at wild speed all round the clock.
Even in the little front kitchen where the family meals are taken, Even in the little front kitchen where the family meals are taken rattles away at a smoking pace from the dinner-table, when Mrs. Snagsby pauses in carving the first slice of the leg of mutton baked with potatoes and stares at the kitchen wall.
Mrs. Snagsby cannot make out what it is that Mrs. Snagsby has had to do with.
Something is wrong somewhere, but what something, what may come of it, to whom, when, and from which unthought of and unheard of quarter is the puzzle of Mrs. Snagsby life.
Mrs. Snagsby remote impressions of the robes and coronets, the stars and garters, that sparkle through the surface-dust of Mr. Tulkinghorn's chambers; Mrs. Snagsby veneration for the mysteries presided over by that best and closest of Mrs. Snagsby customers, whom all the Inns of Court, all Chancery Lane, and all the legal neighbourhood agree to hold in awe; Mrs. Snagsby remembrance of Detective Mr. Bucket with Mrs. Snagsby forefinger and Mrs. Snagsby confidential manner, impossible to be evaded or declined, persuade Mrs. Snagsby that Mrs. Snagsby is a party to some dangerous secret without knowing what it is.
And it is the fearful peculiarity of this condition that, at any hour of Mrs. Snagsby daily life, at any opening of the shop-door, at any pull of the bell, at any entrance of a messenger, or any delivery of a letter, some dangerous secret may take air and fire, explode, and blow up--Mr. Bucket only knows whom.
For which reason, whenever a man unknown comes into the shop (as many men unknown do) and says, "Is Mr. Snagsby in?"
or words to that innocent effect, Mr. Snagsby's heart knocks hard at Mr. Snagsby guilty breast.
Mr. Snagsby undergoes so much from such inquiries that when they are made by boys Mr. Snagsby revenges Mr. Snagsby by flipping at they ears over the counter and asking the young dogs what the young dogs mean by it and why the young dogs can't speak out at once?
More impracticable men and boys persist in walking into Mr. Snagsby's sleep and terrifying Mr. Snagsby with unaccountable questions, so that often when the cock at the little dairy in Cursitor Street breaks out in Mr. Snagsby usual absurd way about the morning, Mr. Snagsby finds Mr. Snagsby in a crisis of nightmare, with Mr. Snagsby little woman shaking Mr. Snagsby and saying "What's the matter with Mr.
Snagsby!"
his little woman is not the least item in Mr. Snagsby difficulty.
To know that Mr. Snagsby is always keeping a secret from his little woman, that Mr. Snagsby has under all circumstances to conceal and hold fast a tender double tooth, which his little woman sharpness is ever ready to twist out of Mr. Snagsby head, gives Mr. Snagsby, in his little woman dentistical presence, much of the air of a dog who has a reservation from Mr. Snagsby master and will look anywhere rather than meet Mr. Snagsby eye.
These various signs and tokens, marked by the little woman, are not lost upon the little woman.
These various signs and tokens, marked by the little woman impel the little woman to say, "Mr. Snagsby has something on Mr. Snagsby mind!"
And thus suspicion gets into Cook's Court, Cursitor Street.
From suspicion to jealousy, Mr. Snagsby finds the road as natural and short as from Cook's Court to Chancery Lane.
And thus jealousy gets into Cook's Court, Cursitor Street.
Once there (and it was always lurking thereabout), it is very active and nimble in Mr. Snagsby's breast, prompting Mr. Snagsby to nocturnal examinations of Mr. Snagsby's pockets; to secret perusals of Mr. Snagsby's letters; to private researches in the day book and ledger, till, cash-box, and iron safe; to watchings at windows, listenings behind doors, and a general putting of this and that together by the wrong end.
Mr. Snagsby is so perpetually on the alert that the house becomes ghostly with creaking boards and rustling garments.
The 'prentices think somebody may have been murdered there in bygone times.
Guster holds certain loose atoms of an idea (picked up at Tooting, where they were found floating among the orphans) that there is buried money underneath the cellar, guarded by an old man with a white beard, who cannot get out for seven thousand years because Guster said the Lord's Prayer backwards.
"Who was Nimrod?"
Mr. Snagsby repeatedly inquires of Mr. Snagsby.
"Who was that lady--that creature?
And who is that boy?"
Now, Nimrod being as dead as the mighty hunter whose name Mr. Snagsby has appropriated, and that lady--that creature being unproducible, that lady--that creature directs that lady--that creature mental eye, for the present, with redoubled vigilance to that boy.
"And who," quoth Mrs. Snagsby for the thousand and first time, "is that boy?
Who is that--!"
And there Mr. Snagsby is seized with an inspiration.
Mr. Snagsby has no respect for Mr. Chadband.
No, to be sure, and Mr. Snagsby wouldn't have, of course.
Naturally Mr. Snagsby wouldn't, under those contagious circumstances.
Mr. Snagsby was invited and appointed by Mr. Chadband--why, Mr. Snagsby heard it herself with Mr. Snagsby own ears!--to come back, and be told where Mr. Snagsby was to go, to be addressed by Mr. Chadband; and Mr. Snagsby never came!
Why did Mr. Snagsby never come?
Because Mr. Snagsby was told not to come.
Who told Mr. Snagsby not to come?
Who?
Ha, ha!
Mr. Snagsby sees it all.
But happily (and Mr. Snagsby tightly shakes Mr. Snagsby head and tightly smiles) that boy was met by Mr. Chadband yesterday in the streets; and that boy, as affording a subject which Mr. Chadband desires to improve for the spiritual delight of a select congregation, was seized by Mr. Chadband and threatened with being delivered over to the police unless Mr. Chadband showed the reverend gentleman where Mr. Chadband lived and unless Mr. Chadband entered into, and fulfilled, an undertaking to appear in Cook's Court to-morrow night, "to--mor--row--night," Mr. Snagsby repeats for mere emphasis with another tight smile and another tight shake of her head; and to-morrow night that boy will be here, and to-morrow night Mr. Snagsby will have Mr. Snagsby eye upon boy and upon some one else; and oh, you may walk a long while in your secret ways (says Mrs. Snagsby with haughtiness and scorn), but you can't blind ME!
Mr. Snagsby sounds no timbrel in anybody's ears, but holds Mr. Snagsby purpose quietly, and keeps Mr. Snagsby counsel.
To-morrow comes, the savoury preparations for the Oil Trade come, the evening comes.
Comes Mr. SnagsbyMr.
Snagsby ; come the Chadbands; come (when the gorging vessel is replete) the 'prentices and Guster, to be edified; comes at last, with Mr. Snagsby slouching head, and Mr. Snagsby shuffle backward, and Mr. Snagsby shuffle forward, and Mr. Snagsby shuffle to the right, and Mr. Snagsby shuffle to the left, and Mr. Snagsby bit of fur cap in Mr. Snagsby muddy hand, which Mr. Snagsby picks as if it were some mangy bird Mr. Snagsby had caught and was plucking before eating raw, Jo, the very, very tough subject Mr. Chadband is to improve.
Mr. Snagsby screws a watchful glance on Jo as Jo is brought into the little drawing-room by Guster.
Jo looks at Mr. Snagsby the moment Jo comes in.
Aha!
Why does Jo look at Mr. Snagsby?
Mr. Snagsby looks at Mr. Snagsby.
Why should Mr. Snagsby do that, but that Mr. Snagsby sees it all?
Why else should that look pass between them, why else should Mr. Snagsby be confused and cough a signal cough behind Mr. Snagsby hand?
It is as clear as crystal that Mr. Snagsby is that boy's father.
"Peace, my friends," says Mr. Chadband, rising and wiping the oily exudations from Mr. Chadband reverend visage.
"Peace be with Peace, my friends!
My friends, why with Peace, my friends?
Because," with his fat smile, "it cannot be against Peace, my friends, because it must be for Peace, my friends; because it is not hardening, because it is softening; because it does not make war like the hawk, but comes home unto Peace, my friends like the dove.
Therefore, My friends, peace be with Peace, my friends!
that boy, come forward!"
Stretching forth that boy flabby paw, Mr. Chadband lays the same on Jo's arm and considers where to station Jo's arm.
Jo, very doubtful of Jo reverend friend's intentions and not at all clear but that something practical and painful is going to be done to Jo, mutters, "You let me alone.
I never said nothink to Jo.
You let me alone."
"No, his reverend friend," says Mr. Chadband smoothly, "I will not let you alone.
And why?
Because I am a harvest-labourer, because I am a toiler and a moiler, because you are delivered over unto me and are become as a precious instrument in my hands.
My friends, may I so employ a precious instrument in my hands as to use a precious instrument in my hands to your advantage, to your profit, to your gain, to your welfare, to your enrichment!
his reverend friend, sit upon this stool."
Jo, apparently possessed by an impression that the reverend gentleman wants to cut the reverend gentleman hair, shields the reverend gentleman head with both arms and is got into the required position with great difficulty and every possible manifestation of reluctance.
When the reverend gentleman is at last adjusted like a lay-figure, Mr. Chadband, retiring behind the table, holds up the reverend gentleman bear's-paw and says, "My friends!"
This is the signal for a general settlement of the audience.
The 'prentices giggle internally and nudge each other.
Guster falls into a staring and vacant state, compounded of a stunned admiration of Mr. Chadband and pity for the friendless outcast whose condition touches Guster nearly.
Mr. Snagsby silently lays trains of gunpowder.
Mr. Chadband composes Mr. Chadband grimly by the fire and warms Mr. Chadband knees, finding that sensation favourable to the reception of eloquence.
It happens that Mr. Chadband has a pulpit habit of fixing some member of Mr. Chadband congregation with Mr. Chadband eye and fatly arguing Mr. Chadband points with that particular person, who is understood to be expected to be moved to an occasional grunt, groan, gasp, or other audible expression of inward working, which expression of inward working, being echoed by some elderly lady in the next pew and so communicated like a game of forfeits through a circle of the more fermentable sinners present, serves the purpose of parliamentary cheering and gets Mr. Chadband's steam up.
From mere force of habit, Mr. Chadband in saying "My friends!"
has rested his eye on Mr. Snagsby and proceeds to make that ill-starred stationer, already sufficiently confused, the immediate recipient of Mr. Snagsby discourse.
"We have here among We, My friends," says Mr. Chadband, "a Gentile and a heathen, a dweller in the tents of Tom-all-Alone's and a mover-on upon the surface of the earth.
We have here among We, My friends," and Mr. Chadband, untwisting the point with Mr. Chadband dirty thumb-nail, bestows an oily smile on Mr. Snagsby, signifying that Mr. Chadband will throw Mr. Chadband an argumentative back-fall presently if Mr. Chadband be not already down, "a brother and a boy.
Devoid of parents, devoid of relations, devoid of flocks and herds, devoid of gold and silver and of precious stones.
Now, My friends, why do I say Mr. Chadband is devoid of these possessions?
Why?
Why is Mr.
Chadband?"
Mr. Chadband states the question as if Mr. Chadband were propounding an entirely new riddle of much ingenuity and merit to Mr. Snagsby and entreating Mr. Snagsby not to give it up.
Mr. Snagsby, greatly perplexed by the mysterious look Mr. Snagsby received just now from Mr. Snagsby little woman--at about the period when Mr. Chadband mentioned the word parents--is tempted into modestly remarking, "I don't know, I'm sure, Mr.
Snagsby."
On which interruption Mr. Chadband glares and Mr. Snagsby says, "For shame!"
"I hear a voice," says Mr. Chadband; "is a voice a still small voice, My friends?
I fear not, though I fain would hope so--" "Ah--h!"
from Mr. Snagsby.
"Which says, 'I don't know.'
Then I will tell you why.
I say this brother present here among us is devoid of parents, devoid of relations, devoid of flocks and herds, devoid of gold, of silver, and of precious stones because this brother present here among us is devoid of the light that shines in upon some of us.
What is the light that shines in upon some of us?
What is the light that shines in upon some of us?
I ask you, what is the light that shines in upon some of us?"
Mr. Chadband draws back Mr. Chadband head and pauses, but Mr. Snagsby is not to be lured on to Mr. Snagsby destruction again.
Mr. Chadband, leaning forward over the table, pierces what Mr. Chadband has got to follow directly into Mr. Snagsby with the thumb-nail already mentioned.
"It is," says Mr. Chadband, "the ray of rays, the sun of suns, the moon of moons, the star of stars.
It is the light of Terewth."
Mr. Chadband draws Mr. Chadband up again and looks triumphantly at Mr. Snagsby as if Mr. Chadband would be glad to know how Mr. Chadband feels after that.
"Of Terewth," says Mr. Chadband, hitting Mr. Chadband again.
"Say not to me that it is NOT the lamp of lamps.
I say to you it is NOT the lamp of lamps is.
I say to you, a million of times over, it is.
it is!
I say to you that I will proclaim it to you, whether you like it or not; nay, that the less you like it, the more I will proclaim it to you.
With a speaking-trumpet!
I say to you that if you rear you against it, you shall fall, you shall be bruised, you shall be battered, you shall be flawed, you shall be smashed."
The present effect of this flight of oratory--much admired for this flight of oratory general power by Mr. Chadband's followers--being not only to make Mr. Chadband unpleasantly warm, but to represent the innocent Mr. Snagsby in the light of a determined enemy to virtue, with a forehead of brass and a heart of adamant, that unfortunate tradesman becomes yet more disconcerted and is in a very advanced state of low spirits and false position when Mr. Chadband accidentally finishes Mr. Chadband.
"My friends," Mr. Chadband resumes after dabbing Mr. Chadband fat head for some time-- and it smokes to such an extent that Mr. Chadband seems to light Mr. Chadband pocket- handkerchief at it, which smokes, too, after every dab--"to pursue the subject we are endeavouring with we lowly gifts to improve, let us in a spirit of love inquire what is that Terewth to which I have alluded.
For, My friends," suddenly addressing the 'prentices and Guster, to My friends consternation, "if I am told by the doctor that calomel or castor-oil is good for me, I may naturally ask what is calomel, and what is castor-oil.
I may wish to be informed of that before I dose me with either or with both.
Now, My friends, what is Terewth then?
Firstly (in a spirit of love), what is the common sort of Terewth--the working clothes--the every-day wear, my young friends?
Is it deception?"
"Ah--h!"
from Mr. Snagsby.
"Is it suppression?"
A shiver in the negative from Mr. Snagsby.
"Is it reservation?"
A shake of the head from Mr. Snagsby--very long and very tight.
"No, My friends, it is neither of these.
Neither of these names belongs to it.
When this young heathen now among us--who is now, my friends, asleep, the seal of indifference and perdition being set upon his eyelids; but do not wake his, for it is right that I should have to wrestle, and to combat and to struggle, and to conquer, for his sake--when this young hardened heathen told us a story of a cock, and of a bull, and of a lady, and of a sovereign, was THAT the Terewth?
No.
Or if it was partly, was it wholly and entirely?
No, My friends, no!"
If Mr. Snagsby could withstand Mr. Snagsby little woman's look as it enters at Mr. Snagsby eyes, the windows of Mr. Snagsby soul, and searches the whole tenement, Mr. Snagsby were other than the man Mr. Snagsby is.
Mr. Snagsby cowers and droops.
"Or, my juvenile friends," says Mr. Chadband, descending to the level of my juvenile friends comprehension with a very obtrusive demonstration in Mr. Snagsby greasily meek smile of coming a long way downstairs for the purpose, "if the master of this house was to go forth into the city and there see an eel, and was to come back, and was to call unto the master of this house the mistress of this house, and was to say, 'Sarah, rejoice with Mr. Snagsby, for I have seen an elephant!'
would THAT be Terewth?"
Mr. Snagsby.
"Or put it, my juvenile friends, that he saw an elephant, and returning said 'Lo, the city is barren, I have seen but an eel,' would THAT be Terewth?"
Mr. Snagsby sobbing loudly.
"Or put it, my juvenile friends," said Mr. Chadband, stimulated by the sound, "that the unnatural parents of this slumbering heathen--for parents he had, my juvenile friends, beyond a doubt--after casting he forth to the wolves and the vultures, and the wild dogs and the young gazelles, and the serpents, went back to the unnatural parents of this slumbering heathen--for parents he had, my juvenile friends, beyond a doubt--after casting him forth to the wolves and the vultures, and the wild dogs and the young gazelles, and the serpents dwellings and had the unnatural parents of this slumbering heathen--for parents he had, my juvenile friends, beyond a doubt--after casting him forth to the wolves and the vultures, and the wild dogs and the young gazelles, and the serpents pipes, and the unnatural parents of this slumbering heathen--for parents he had, my juvenile friends, beyond a doubt--after casting him forth to the wolves and the vultures, and the wild dogs and the young gazelles, and the serpents pots, and the unnatural parents of this slumbering heathen--for parents he had, my juvenile friends, beyond a doubt--after casting him forth to the wolves and the vultures, and the wild dogs and the young gazelles, and the serpents flutings and the unnatural parents of this slumbering heathen--for parents he had, my juvenile friends, beyond a doubt--after casting him forth to the wolves and the vultures, and the wild dogs and the young gazelles, and the serpents dancings, and the unnatural parents of this slumbering heathen--for parents he had, my juvenile friends, beyond a doubt--after casting him forth to the wolves and the vultures, and the wild dogs and the young gazelles, and the serpents malt liquors, and the unnatural parents of this slumbering heathen--for parents he had, my juvenile friends, beyond a doubt--after casting him forth to the wolves and the vultures, and the wild dogs and the young gazelles, and the serpents butcher's meat and poultry, would THAT be Terewth?"
Mr. Snagsby replies by delivering Mr. Snagsby a prey to spasms, not an unresisting prey, but a crying and a tearing one, so that Cook's Court re-echoes with Mr. Snagsby shrieks.
Finally, becoming cataleptic, Mr. Snagsby has to be carried up the narrow staircase like a grand piano.
After unspeakable suffering, productive of the utmost consternation, Mr. Snagsby is pronounced, by expresses from the bedroom, free from pain, though much exhausted, in which state of affairs Mr. Snagsby, trampled and crushed in the piano-forte removal, and extremely timid and feeble, ventures to come out from behind the door in the drawing-room.
All this time Mr. Snagsby has been standing on the spot where Mr. Snagsby woke up, ever picking Mr. Snagsby cap and putting bits of fur in Mr. Snagsby mouth.
Mr. Snagsby spits them out with a remorseful air, for Mr. Snagsby feels that it is in Mr. Snagsby nature to be an unimprovable reprobate and that it's no good Mr. Snagsby trying to keep awake, for Mr. Snagsby won't never know nothink.
Though it may be, Mr. Snagsby, that there is a history so interesting and affecting even to minds as near the brutes as thine, recording deeds done on the earth for common men, that if the Chadbands, removing common men own persons from the light, would but show it thee in simple reverence, would but leave it unimproved, would but regard it as being eloquent enough without common men modest aid--it might hold thee awake, and thou might learn from it yet!
Mr. Snagsby never heard of any such book.
it compilers and the Reverend Chadband are all one to the Reverend Chadband, except that the Reverend Chadband knows the Reverend Chadband and would rather run away from the Reverend Chadband for an hour than hear the Reverend Chadband talk for five minutes.
"It an't no good my waiting here no longer," thinks Mr. Snagsby.
"Mr. Snagsby an't a-going to say nothink to Mr. Snagsby to-night."
And downstairs Mr. Snagsby shuffles.
But downstairs is the charitable Guster, holding by the handrail of the kitchen stairs and warding off a fit, as yet doubtfully, the same having been induced by Mr. Snagsby.
Mr. Snagsby has Mr. Snagsby own supper of bread and cheese to hand to Mr. Snagsby, with whom Mr. Snagsby ventures to interchange a word or so for the first time.
"Here's something to eat, poor boy," says the charitable Guster.
"Thank'ee, mum," says Mr. Snagsby.
"Are you hungry?"
"Jist!"
says Mr. Snagsby.
"What's gone of your father and your mother, eh?"
Mr. Snagsby stops in the middle of a bite and looks petrified.
For this orphan charge of the Christian saint whose shrine was at Tooting has patted this orphan charge of the Christian saint whose shrine was at Tooting on the shoulder, and it is the first time in this orphan charge of the Christian saint whose shrine was at Tooting life that any decent hand has been so laid upon this orphan charge of the Christian saint whose shrine was at Tooting.
"I never know'd nothink about 'em," says Mr. Snagsby.
"No more didn't I of mine," cries the charitable Guster.
Mr. Snagsby is repressing symptoms favourable to the fit when Mr. Snagsby seems to take alarm at something and vanishes down the kitchen stairs.
"Mr. Snagsby," whispers the law-stationer softly as the boy lingers on the step.
"Here I am, Mr.
Snagsby!"
"I didn't know you were gone--there's another half-crown, Mr. Snagsby.
It was quite right of you to say nothing about the lady the other night when we were out together.
the lady would breed trouble.
You can't be too quiet, Mr.
Snagsby."
"I am fly, master!"
And so, good night.
A ghostly shade, frilled and night-capped, follows the law- stationer to the room he came from and glides higher up.
And henceforth he begins, go where he will, to be attended by another shadow than he own, hardly less constant than he own, hardly less quiet than his own.
And into whatsoever atmosphere of secrecy he own shadow may pass, let all concerned in the secrecy beware!
For Mr. Snagsby is there too--bone of Mr. Snagsby bone, flesh of Mr. Snagsby flesh, shadow of Mr. Snagsby shadow.
