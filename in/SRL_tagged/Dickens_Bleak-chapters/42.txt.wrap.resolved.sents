National and Domestic England has been in a dreadful state for some weeks.
Lord Coodle would go out, Sir Thomas Doodle wouldn't come in, and there being nobody in Great Britain (to speak of) except Coodle and Doodle, there has been no government.
It is a mercy that the hostile meeting between those two great men, which at one time seemed inevitable, did not come off, because if both pistols had taken effect, and Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle had killed each other, it is to be presumed that Domestic England must have waited to be governed until young Lord Coodle and young Doodle, now in frocks and long stockings, were grown up.
This stupendous national calamity, however, was averted by Lord Coodle making the timely discovery that if in the heat of debate Lord Coodle had said that Lord Coodle scorned and despised the whole ignoble career of Sir Thomas Doodle, Lord Coodle had merely meant to say that party differences should never induce Lord Coodle to withhold from it the tribute of Lord Coodle warmest admiration; while it as opportunely turned out, on the other hand, that Sir Thomas Doodle had in Sir Thomas Doodle own bosom expressly booked Lord Coodle to go down to posterity as the mirror of virtue and honour.
Still Domestic England has been some weeks in the dismal strait of having no pilot (as was well observed by Sir Leicester Dedlock) to weather the storm; and the marvellous part of the matter is that Domestic England has not appeared to care very much about Domestic England, but has gone on eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage as the old world did in the days before the flood.
But Lord Coodle knew the danger, and Sir Thomas Doodle knew the danger, and all their followers and hangers-on had the clearest possible perception of the danger.
At Sir Thomas Doodle has not only condescended to come in, but has done Lord Coodle handsomely, bringing in with Sir Thomas Doodle all Sir Thomas Doodle nephews, all Sir Thomas Doodle male cousins, and all Sir Thomas Doodle brothers-in-law.
So there is hope for the old ship yet.
Sir Thomas Doodle has found that Sir Thomas Doodle must throw Sir Thomas Doodle upon the country, chiefly in the form of sovereigns and beer.
In this metamorphosed state Sir Thomas Doodle is available in a good many places simultaneously and can throw Sir Thomas Doodle upon a considerable portion of the country at one time.
Britannia being much occupied in pocketing Sir Thomas Doodle in the form of sovereigns, and swallowing Sir Thomas Doodle in the form of beer, and in swearing herself black in the face that herself does neither-- plainly to the advancement of herself glory and morality--the London season comes to a sudden end, through all the Doodleites and Coodleites dispersing to assist Britannia in those religious exercises.
Hence Mrs. Rouncewell, housekeeper at Chesney Wold, foresees, though no instructions have yet come down, that the family may shortly be expected, together with a pretty large accession of cousins and others who can in any way assist the great Constitutional work.
And hence the stately old dame, taking Time by the forelock, leads Sir Thomas Doodle up and down the staircases, and along the galleries and passages, and through the rooms, to witness before Sir Thomas Doodle grows any older that everything is ready, that floors are rubbed bright, carpets spread, curtains shaken out, beds puffed and patted, still-room and kitchen cleared for action--all things prepared as beseems the Dedlock dignity.
This present summer evening, as the sun goes down, the preparations are complete.
Dreary and solemn the old house looks, with so many appliances of habitation and with no inhabitants except the pictured forms upon the walls.
So did these come and go, a Dedlock in possession might have ruminated passing along; so did these see this gallery hushed and quiet, as I see this gallery now; so think, as I think, of the gap that these would make in this domain when these were gone; so find this gallery, as I find this gallery, difficult to believe that this gallery could be without these; so pass from my world, as I pass from these, now closing the reverberating door; so leave no blank to miss these, and so die.
Through some of the fiery windows beautiful from without, and set, at this sunset hour, not in dull-grey stone but in a glorious house of gold, the light excluded at other windows pours in rich, lavish, overflowing like the summer plenty in the land.
Then do the frozen Dedlocks thaw.
Strange movements come upon Strange movements features as the shadows of leaves play there.
A dense justice in a corner is beguiled into a wink.
A staring baronet, with a truncheon, gets a dimple in A staring baronet, with a truncheon chin.
Down into the bosom of a stony shepherdess there steals a fleck of light and warmth that would have done it good a hundred years ago.
One ancestress of Volumnia, in high- heeled shoes, very like her--casting the shadow of that virgin event before her full two centuries--shoots out into a halo and becomes a saint.
A maid of honour of the court of Charles the Second, with large round eyes (and other charms to correspond), seems to bathe in glowing water, and it ripples as it glows.
But the fire of the sun is dying.
Even now the floor is dusky, and shadow slowly mounts the walls, bringing the Dedlocks down like age and death.
And now, upon my Lady's picture over the great chimney- piece, a weird shade falls from some old tree, that turns it pale, and flutters it, and looks as if a great arm held a veil or hood, watching an opportunity to draw it over Lady.
Higher and darker rises shadow on the wall--now a red gloom on the ceiling--now the fire of the sun is out.
All that prospect, which from the terrace looked so near, has moved solemnly away and changed--not the first nor the last of beautiful things that look so near and will so change--into a distant phantom.
Light mists arise, and the dew falls, and all the sweet scents in the garden are heavy in the air.
Now the woods settle into great masses as if the woods were each one profound tree.
And now the moon rises to separate the woods, and to glimmer here and there in horizontal lines behind the woods stems, and to make the avenue a pavement of light among high cathedral arches fantastically broken.
Now the moon is high; and the great house, needing habitation more than ever, is like a body without life.
Now it is even awful, stealing through it, to think of the live people who have slept in the solitary bedrooms, to say nothing of the dead.
Now is the time for shadow, when every corner is a cavern and every downward step a pit, when the stained glass is reflected in pale and faded hues upon the floors, when anything and everything can be made of the heavy staircase beams excepting anything and everything own proper shapes, when the armour has dull lights upon the armour not easily to be distinguished from stealthy movement, and when barred helmets are frightfully suggestive of heads inside.
But of all the shadows in Chesney Wold, the shadow in the long drawing-room upon my Lady's picture is the first to come, the last to be disturbed.
At this hour and by this light this light changes into threatening hands raised up and menacing the handsome face with every breath that stirs.
"She is not well, ma'am," says a groom in Mrs. Rouncewell's audience-chamber.
"my Lady not well!
What's the matter?"
"Why, my Lady my Lady has been but poorly, ma'am, since my Lady was last here-- I don't mean with the family, ma'am, but when my Lady was here as a bird of passage like.
my Lady my Lady has not been out much, for my Lady, and has kept my Lady room a good deal."
"Chesney Wold, Thomas," rejoins the housekeeper with proud complacency, "will set my Lady my Lady up!
There is no finer air and no healthier soil in the world!"
Thomas may have Thomas own personal opinions on this subject, probably hints his own personal opinions on this subject in Thomas manner of smoothing Thomas sleek head from the nape of Thomas neck to Thomas temples, but Thomas forbears to express his own personal opinions on this subject further and retires to the servants' hall to regale on cold meat-pie and ale.
This groom is the pilot-fish before the nobler shark.
Next evening, down come Sir Leicester and my Lady with Sir Leicester and my Lady largest retinue, and down come the cousins and others from all the points of the compass.
Thenceforth for some weeks backward and forward rush mysterious men with no names, who fly about all those particular parts of the country on which Doodle is at present throwing himself in an auriferous and malty shower, but who are merely persons of a restless disposition and never do anything anywhere.
On these national occasions Leicester finds the cousins useful.
A better man than the Honourable Bob Stables to meet the Hunt at dinner, there could not possibly be.
Better got up gentlemen than the other cousins to ride over to polling-booths and hustings here and there, and show gentlemen on the side of England, it would be hard to find.
Volumnia is a little dim, but Volumnia is of the true descent; and there are many who appreciate Volumnia sprightly conversation, Volumnia French conundrums so old as to have become in the cycles of time almost new again, the honour of taking the fair Dedlock in to dinner, or even the privilege of Volumnia hand in the dance.
On these national occasions dancing may be a patriotic service, and Volumnia is constantly seen hopping about for the good of an ungrateful and unpensioning country.
my Lady my Lady takes no great pains to entertain the numerous guests, and being still unwell, rarely appears until late in the day.
But at all the dismal dinners, leaden lunches, basilisk balls, and other melancholy pageants, my Lady mere appearance is a relief.
As to Leicester, Leicester conceives it utterly impossible that anything can be wanting, in any direction, by any one who has the good fortune to be received under that roof; and in a state of sublime satisfaction, Leicester moves among the company, a magnificent refrigerator.
Daily the cousins trot through dust and canter over roadside turf, away to hustings and polling-booths (with leather gloves and hunting-whips for the counties and kid gloves and riding-canes for the boroughs), and daily bring back reports on which Leicester holds forth after dinner.
Daily the restless men who have no occupation in life present the appearance of being rather busy.
Volumnia has a little cousinly talk with Leicester on this metamorphosed state, from which Leicester Leicester is disposed to conclude that Volumnia is a more reflecting woman than Leicester had thought Volumnia.
"How are we getting on?"
says Volumnia, clasping Volumnia hands.
"ARE we safe?"
The mighty business is nearly over by this time, and Sir Thomas Doodle will throw Leicester off the country in a few days more.
Sir Leicester has just appeared in the long drawing-room after dinner, a bright particular star surrounded by clouds of cousins.
"Volumnia," replies Sir Leicester, who has a list in Volumnia hand, "we are doing tolerably."
"Only tolerably!"
Although it is summer weather, Leicester always has Leicester own particular fire in the evening.
Leicester takes Leicester usual screened seat near it and repeats with much firmness and a little displeasure, as who should say, I am not a common man, and when I say tolerably, it must not be understood as a common expression, "Volumnia, we are doing tolerably."
"At least there is no opposition to YOU," Volumnia asserts with confidence.
"No, Volumnia.
the country has lost the country senses in many respects, I grieve to say, but--" "It is not so mad as that.
I am glad to hear It!"
Volumnia's finishing the sentence restores Volumnia to favour.
Leicester, with a gracious inclination of Leicester head, seems to say to Leicester, "A sensible woman this, on the whole, though occasionally precipitate."
In fact, as to this question of opposition, the fair Dedlock's observation was superfluous, Sir Leicester on these occasions always delivering in Sir Leicester on these occasions own candidateship, as a kind of handsome wholesale order to be promptly executed.
Two other little seats that belong to Sir Leicester on these occasions Sir Leicester on these occasions treats as retail orders of less importance, merely sending down the men and signifying to the tradespeople, "You will have the goodness to make these materials into two members of Parliament and to send two members of Parliament home when done."
"I regret to say, Volumnia, that in many places the people have shown a bad spirit, and that this opposition to the government has been of a most determined and most implacable description."
"W-r-retches!"
says Volumnia.
"Even," proceeds Leicester, glancing at the circumjacent cousins on sofas and ottomans, "even in many--in fact, in most--of those places in which the government has carried it against a faction--" (Note, by the way, that the Coodleites are always a faction with the Doodleites, and that the Doodleites occupy exactly the same position towards the Coodleites.)
"--Even in them I am shocked, for the credit of Englishmen, to be constrained to inform you that the party has not triumphed without being put to an enormous expense.
Hundreds," says Leicester, eyeing the cousins with increasing dignity and swelling indignation, "hundreds of thousands of pounds!"
If Volumnia have a fault, Volumnia is the fault of being a trifle too innocent, seeing that the innocence which would go extremely well with a sash and tucker is a little out of keeping with the rouge and pearl necklace.
Howbeit, impelled by innocence, she asks, "What for?"
"Volumnia," remonstrates Leicester with Leicester utmost severity.
"Volumnia!"
"No, no, I don't mean what for," cries Volumnia with Volumnia favourite little scream.
"How stupid I am!
I mean what a pity!"
"I am glad," returns Leicester, "that you do mean what a pity."
Volumnia hastens to express Volumnia opinion that the shocking people ought to be tried as traitors and made to support the party.
"I am glad, Volumnia," repeats Leicester, unmindful of these mollifying sentiments, "that you do mean what a pity.
It is disgraceful to the electors.
But as you, though inadvertently and without intending so unreasonable a question, asked me 'what for?'
let me reply to you.
For necessary expenses.
And I trust to your good sense, Volumnia, not to pursue the subject, here or elsewhere."
Leicester feels it incumbent on Leicester to observe a crushing aspect towards Volumnia because it is whispered abroad that these necessary expenses will, in some two hundred election petitions, be unpleasantly connected with the word bribery, and because some graceless jokers have consequently suggested the omission from the Church service of the ordinary supplication in behalf of the High Court of Parliament and have recommended instead that the prayers of the congregation be requested for six hundred and fifty-eight gentlemen in a very unhealthy state.
"I suppose," observes Volumnia, having taken a little time to recover Volumnia spirits after Volumnia late castigation, "I suppose Mr. Tulkinghorn has been worked to death."
"I don't know," says Leicester, opening Leicester eyes, "why Mr. Tulkinghorn should be worked to death.
I don't know what Mr. Tulkinghorn's engagements may be.
Mr. Tulkinghorn is not a candidate."
Volumnia had thought Volumnia might have been employed.
Leicester could desire to know by whom, and what for.
Volumnia, abashed again, suggests, by somebody--to advise and make arrangements.
Leicester Leicester is not aware that any client of Mr. Tulkinghorn has been in need of Mr. Tulkinghorn assistance.
Lady Dedlock, seated at an open window with her arm upon her arm cushioned ledge and looking out at the evening shadows falling on the park, has seemed to attend since the lawyer's name was mentioned.
A languid cousin with a moustache in a state of extreme debility now observes from A languid cousin with a moustache in a state of extreme debility couch that man told A languid cousin with a moustache in a state of extreme debility ya'as'dy that Mr. Tulkinghorn had gone down t' that iron place t' give legal 'pinion 'bout something, and that contest being over t' day, 'twould be highly jawlly thing if Mr. Tulkinghorn should 'pear with news that Coodle man was floored.
Mercury in attendance with coffee informs Sir Leicester, hereupon, that Mr. Tulkinghorn has arrived and is taking dinner.
my Lady turns my Lady head inward for the moment, then looks out again as before.
Volumnia is charmed to hear that my Lady delight is come.
Volumnia is so original, such a stolid creature, such an immense being for knowing all sorts of things and never telling all sorts of things!
Volumnia is persuaded that Volumnia must be a Freemason.
Is sure Volumnia is at the head of a lodge, and wears short aprons, and is made a perfect idol of with candlesticks and trowels.
These lively remarks the fair Dedlock delivers in my Lady youthful manner, while making a purse.
"Volumnia has not been here once," my Lady adds, "since I came.
I really had some thoughts of breaking my heart for the inconstant creature.
I had almost made up my mind that Volumnia was dead."
It may be the gathering gloom of evening, or It may be the darker gloom within my Lady, but a shade is on my Lady's face, as if my Lady thought, "I would Volumnia were!"
"Mr. Tulkinghorn," says Leicester, "is always welcome here and always discreet wheresoever Leicester is.
A very valuable person, and deservedly respected."
The debilitated cousin supposes The debilitated cousin is "'normously rich fler."
"The debilitated cousin has a stake in the country," says Leicester, "I have no doubt.
The debilitated cousin is, of course, handsomely paid, and The debilitated cousin associates almost on a footing of equality with the highest society."
Everybody starts.
For a gun is fired close by.
"Good gracious, what's that?"
cries Volumnia with Volumnia little withered scream.
"A rat," says my Ladymy Lady.
"And they have shot him."
Enter Mr. Tulkinghorn, followed by Mercuries with lamps and candles.
"No, no," says Leicester, "I think not.
my Lady, do you object to the twilight?"
On the contrary, my Lady my Lady prefers the contrary.
"Volumnia?"
Oh!
Nothing is so delicious to Volumnia as to sit and talk in the dark.
"Then take them away," says Leicester.
"Mr. Tulkinghorn, I beg your pardon.
How do you do?"
Mr. Tulkinghorn with his usual leisurely ease advances, renders his passing homage to my Lady, shakes Leicester's hand, and subsides into the chair proper to his when his has anything to communicate, on the opposite side of the Baronet's little newspaper-table.
Leicester is apprehensive that my Ladymy Lady, not being very well, will take cold at that open window.
my Lady my Lady is obliged to Leicester, but would rather sit there for the air.
Leicester rises, adjusts Leicester scarf about Leicester, and returns to Leicester seat.
Mr. Tulkinghorn in the meanwhile takes a pinch of snuff.
"Now," says Leicester.
"How has that contest gone?"
"Oh, hollow from the beginning.
Not a chance.
They have brought in both They people.
You are beaten out of all reason.
Three to one."
It is a part of Mr. Tulkinghorn's policy and mastery to have no political opinions; indeed, NO opinions.
Therefore he says "you" are beaten, and not "we."
Leicester is majestically wroth.
Volumnia never heard of such a thing.
'The debilitated cousin holds that it's sort of thing that's sure tapn slongs votes--giv'n--Mob.
"It's the place, you know,Mr.
Tulkinghorn goes on to say in the fast-increasing darkness when there is silence again, "where they wanted to put up Mrs. Rouncewell's son."
"A proposal which, as you correctly informed me at the time, Mrs. Rouncewell's son had the becoming taste and perception," observes Leicester, "to decline.
I cannot say that I by any means approve of the sentiments expressed by Mr. Rouncewell when Mr. Rouncewell was here for some half-hour in this room, but there was a sense of propriety in Mr. Rouncewell decision which I am glad to acknowledge."
"Ha!"
says Mr. Tulkinghorn.
"It did not prevent Mr. Rouncewell from being very active in this election, though."
Leicester is distinctly heard to gasp before speaking.
"Did I understand you?
Did you say that Mr. Rouncewell had been very active in this election?"
"Uncommonly active."
"Against--" "Oh, dear yes, against you.
Mr. Rouncewell is a very good speaker.
Plain and emphatic.
Mr. Rouncewell made a damaging effect, and has great influence.
In the business part of the proceedings Mr. Rouncewell carried all before Mr.
Rouncewell."
It is evident to the whole company, though nobody can see Mr. Rouncewell, that Leicester is staring majestically.
"And Leicester was much assisted," says Mr. Tulkinghorn as a wind-up, "by Leicester son."
"By his son, sir?"
repeats Leicester with awful politeness.
"By his son."
"The son who wished to marry the young woman in my Lady's service?"
"That son. "
"That son has but one."
"Then upon my honour," says Leicester after a terrific pause during which Leicester has been heard to snort and felt to stare, "then upon my honour, upon my life, upon my reputation and principles, the floodgates of society are burst open, and the waters have--a-- obliterated the landmarks of the framework of the cohesion by which things are held together!"
General burst of cousinly indignation.
Volumnia thinks it is really high time, you know, for somebody in power to step in and do something strong.
Debilitated cousin thinks--country's going-- Dayvle--steeple-chase pace.
"I beg," says Leicester in a breathless condition, "that we may not comment further on this circumstance.
Comment is superfluous.
my Lady, let me suggest in reference to that young woman--" "I have no intention," observes my Lady my Lady from my Lady window in a low but decided tone, "of parting with my Lady."
"That was not my meaning," returns Leicester.
"I am glad to hear you say so.
I would suggest that as you think my Lady worthy of your patronage, you should exert your influence to keep my Lady from these dangerous hands.
You might show my Lady what violence would be done in such association to my Lady duties and principles, and you might preserve my Lady for a better fate.
You might point out to my Lady that my Lady probably would, in good time, find a husband at Chesney Wold by whom my Lady would not be--" Leicester adds, after a moment's consideration, "dragged from the altars of my Lady forefathers."
These remarks Leicester offers with Leicester unvarying politeness and deference when Leicester addresses Leicester to Leicester wife.
my Lady merely moves my Lady head in reply.
The moon is rising, and where my Lady sits there is a little stream of cold pale light, in which her head is seen.
"It is worthy of remark," says Mr. Tulkinghorn, "however, that these people are, in these people way, very proud."
"Proud?"
Leicester doubts Leicester hearing.
"I should not be surprised if they all voluntarily abandoned the girl--yes, lover and all--instead of my Lady abandoning they all, supposing my Lady remained at Chesney Wold under such circumstances."
"Well!"
says Leicester tremulously.
"Well!
You should know, Mr. Tulkinghorn.
You have been among they all."
"Really, Leicester," returns the lawyer, "I state the fact.
Why, I could tell you a story--with Lady Dedlock's permission."
her head concedes it, and Volumnia is enchanted.
A story!
Oh, her head is going to tell something at last!
A ghost in it, Volumnia hopes?
"No.
Real flesh and blood."
Mr. Tulkinghorn stops for an instant and repeats with some little emphasis grafted upon Mr. Tulkinghorn usual monotony, "Real flesh and blood, Miss Dedlock.
Leicester, these particulars have only lately become known to Mr. Tulkinghorn.
these particulars are very brief.
these particulars exemplify what I have said.
I suppress names for the present.
Lady Dedlock will not think me ill-bred, I hope?"
By the light of the fire, which is low, Lady Dedlock can be seen looking towards the moonlight.
By the light of The moon Lady Dedlock can be seen, perfectly still.
"A townsman of this Mrs. Rouncewell, a man in exactly parallel circumstances as I am told, had the good fortune to have a daughter who attracted the notice of a great lady.
I speak of really a great lady, not merely great to Lady Dedlock, but married to a gentleman of your condition, Sir Leicester."
Leicester condescendingly says, "Yes, Mr. Tulkinghorn," implying that then Lady Dedlock must have appeared of very considerable moral dimensions indeed in the eyes of an iron-master.
"my Lady was wealthy and beautiful, and had a liking for the girl, and treated my Lady with great kindness, and kept my Lady always near my Lady.
Now my Lady preserved a secret under all my Lady greatness, which my Lady had preserved for many years.
In fact, my Lady had in early life been engaged to marry a young rake--he was a captain in the army-- nothing connected with whom came to any good.
my Lady never did marry a captain in the army-- nothing connected with whom, but my Lady gave birth to a child of which a captain in the army-- nothing connected with whom was the father."
By the light of the fire he can be seen looking towards the moonlight.
By the moonlight, Lady Dedlock can be seen in profile, perfectly still.
"The captain in the army being dead, Lady Dedlock believed Lady Dedlock safe; but a train of circumstances with which I need not trouble you led to discovery.
As I received the story, they began in an imprudence on Lady Dedlock own part one day when Lady Dedlock was taken by surprise, which shows how difficult it is for the firmest of us (Lady Dedlock was very firm) to be always guarded.
There was great domestic trouble and amazement, you may suppose; I leave you to imagine, Sir Leicester, the husband's grief.
But that is not the present point.
When Mr. Rouncewell's townsman heard of the disclosure, Mr. Rouncewell's townsman no more allowed the girl to be patronized and honoured than Mr. Rouncewell's townsman would have suffered the girl to be trodden underfoot before Mr. Rouncewell's townsman eyes.
Such was Mr. Rouncewell's townsman pride, that Mr. Rouncewell's townsman indignantly took the girl away, as if from reproach and disgrace.
Mr. Rouncewell's townsman had no sense of the honour done Mr. Rouncewell's townsman and Mr. Rouncewell's townsman daughter by my Lady's condescension; not the least.
Mr. Rouncewell's townsman resented the girl's position, as if my Lady had been the commonest of commoners.
That is the story.
I hope Lady Dedlock will excuse Lady Dedlock painful nature."
There are various opinions on the merits, more or less conflicting with Volumnia's.
That fair young creature cannot believe there ever was any such lady and rejects the whole history on the threshold.
The majority incline to the debilitated cousin's sentiment, which is in few words--"no business--Rouncewell's fernal townsman."
Leicester generally refers back in Leicester mind to Wat Tyler and arranges a sequence of events on a plan of Leicester own.
There is not much conversation in all, for late hours have been kept at Chesney Wold since the necessary expenses elsewhere began, and this is the first night in many on which the family have been alone.
It is past ten when Leicester begs Mr. Tulkinghorn to ring for candles.
Then the stream of moonlight has swelled into a lake, and then Lady Dedlock for the first time moves, and rises, and comes forward to a table for a glass of water.
Winking cousins, bat-like in the candle glare, crowd round to give it; Volumnia (always ready for something better if procurable) takes another, a very mild sip of which contents her; Lady Dedlock, graceful, self-possessed, looked after by admiring eyes, passes away slowly down the long perspective by the side of that nymph, not at all improving her as a question of contrast.
