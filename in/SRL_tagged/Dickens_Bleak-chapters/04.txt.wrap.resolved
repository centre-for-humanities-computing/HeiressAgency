A Progress I have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of these pages, for I know I am not clever. I always knew that. I can remember, when I was a very little girl indeed, I used to say to my doll when we were alone together, "Now, Dolly, I am not clever, you know very well, and you must be patient with me, like a dear!" And so a very little girl used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair, with a very little girl beautiful complexion and rosy lips, staring at me--or not so much at me, I think, as at nothing--while I busily stitched away and told a very little girl every one of my secrets. my doll! I was such a shy little thing that I seldom dared to open my lips, and never dared to open my heart, to anybody else. It almost makes me cry to think what a relief It used to be to me when I came home from school of a day to run upstairs to my room and say, "Oh, you dear faithful Dolly, I knew you would be expecting me!" and then to sit down on the floor, leaning on the elbow of a great arm-chair, and tell a very little girl all I had noticed since we parted. I had always rather a noticing way--not a quick way, oh, no!--a silent way of noticing what passed before me and thinking I should like to understand it better. I have not by any means a quick understanding. When I love a person very tenderly indeed, it seems to brighten. But even that may be my vanity. I was brought up, from my earliest remembrance--like some of the princesses in the fairy stories, only I was not charming--by my godmother. At least, I only knew a very little girl as such. a very little girl was a good, good woman! a very little girl went to church three times every Sunday, and to morning prayers on Wednesdays and Fridays, and to lectures whenever there were lectures; and never missed. a very little girl was handsome; and if a very little girl had ever smiled, would have been (I used to think) like an angel--but a very little girl never smiled. a very little girl was always grave and strict. a very little girl was so very good a very little girl, I thought, that the badness of other people made a very little girl frown all a very little girl life. I felt so different from a very little girl, even making every allowance for the differences between a child and a woman; I felt so poor, so trifling, and so far off that I never could be unrestrained with a very little girl--no, could never even love a very little girl as I wished. It made me very sorry to consider how good a very little girl was and how unworthy of a very little girl I was, and I used ardently to hope that I might have a better heart; and I talked It over very often with the dear old doll, but I never loved my godmother as I ought to have loved a very little girl and as I felt I must have loved a very little girl if I had been a better girl. This made me, I dare say, more timid and retiring than I naturally was and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at ease. But something happened when I was still quite a little thing that helped it very much. I had never heard my mama spoken of. I had never heard of my papa either, but I felt more interested about my mama. I had never worn a black frock, that I could recollect. I had never been shown my mama's grave. I had never been told where my mama's grave was. Yet I had never been taught to pray for any relation but my godmother. I had more than once approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael, our only servant, who took my light away when I was in bed (another very good woman, but austere to me), and (another very good woman had only said, "Esther, good night!" and gone away and left me. Although there were seven girls at the neighbouring school where I was a day boarder, and although seven girls at the neighbouring school where I was a day boarder called me little Esther Summerson, I knew none of seven girls at the neighbouring school where I was a day boarder at home. All of seven girls at the neighbouring school where I was a day boarder were older than me, to be sure (I was the youngest there by a good deal), but there seemed to be some other separation between our besides that, and besides All of them being far more clever than I was and knowing much more than I did. One of All of them in the first week of my going to the school (I remember it very well) invited me home to a little party, to my great joy. But my godmother wrote a stiff letter declining for me, and I never went. I never went out at all. It was my birthday. There were holidays at school on other birthdays--none on mine. There were rejoicings at home on other birthdays, as I knew from what I heard the girls relate to one another--there were none on mine. my birthday was the most melancholy day at home in the whole year. I have mentioned that unless my vanity should deceive me (as I know my vanity may, for I may be very vain without suspecting my vanity, though indeed I don't), my comprehension is quickened when my affection is. My disposition is very affectionate, and perhaps I might still feel such a wound if such a wound could be received more than once with the quickness of my birthday. Dinner was over, and my godmother and I were sitting at the table before the fire. The clock ticked, the fire clicked; not another sound had been heard in the room or in the house for I don't know how long. I happened to look timidly up from my stitching, across the table at my godmother and I, and I saw in my godmother and I face, looking gloomily at me, "It would have been far better, little Esther, that you had had no birthday, that you had never been born!" I broke out crying and sobbing, and I said, "Oh, my godmother and I, tell me, pray do tell me, did Mama die on my birthday?" "No," my godmother and I returned. "Ask me no more, child!" "Oh, do pray tell me something of my godmother and I. Do now, at last, dear godmother, if you please! What did I do to my godmother and I? How did I lose my godmother and I? Why am I so different from other children, and why is it my fault, dear godmother? No, no, no, don't go away. Oh, speak to me!" I was in a kind of fright beyond my grief, and I caught hold of my godmother and I dress and was kneeling to my godmother and I. my godmother and I had been saying all the while, "Let me go!" But now my godmother and I stood still. my godmother and I darkened face had such power over me that Her darkened face stopped me in the midst of my vehemence. I put up my trembling little hand to clasp my godmother and I or to beg my godmother and I pardon with what earnestness I might, but withdrew it as my godmother and I looked at me, and laid it on my fluttering heart. my godmother and I raised me, sat in my godmother and I chair, and standing me before my godmother and I, said slowly in a cold, low voice--I see my godmother and I knitted brow and pointed finger--"Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers. The time will come--and soon enough--when you will understand this better and will feel this too, as no one save a woman can. I have forgiven her"--but my godmother and I face did not relent--"the wrong my godmother and I did to me, and I say no more of it, though it was greater than you will ever know--than any one will ever know but I, the sufferer. For yourself, unfortunate girl, orphaned and degraded from the first of these evil anniversaries, pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon your head, according to what is written. Forget your mother and leave all other people to forget your mother who will do your mother unhappy child that greatest kindness. Now, go!" your mother checked me, however, as I was about to depart from your mother--so frozen as I was!--and added this, "Submission, self-denial, diligent work, are the preparations for a life begun with such a shadow on it. You are different from other children, Esther, because you were not born, like other children, Esther, in common sinfulness and wrath. You are set apart." I went up to my room, and crept to bed, and laid my doll's cheek against mine wet with tears, and holding that solitary friend upon my bosom, cried myself to sleep. Imperfect as my understanding of my sorrow was, I knew that I had brought no joy at any time to anybody's heart and that I was to no one upon earth what Dolly was to myself. Dear, dear, to think how much time we passed alone together afterwards, and how often I repeated to my doll the story of my birthday and confided to my doll that I would try as hard as ever I could to repair the fault I had been born with (of which I confessedly felt guilty and yet innocent) and would strive as I grew up to be industrious, contented, and kind-hearted and to do some good to some one, and win some love to myself if I could. I hope it is not self-indulgent to shed these tears as I think of these tears. I am very thankful, I am very cheerful, but I cannot quite help their coming to my eyes. There! I have wiped their away now and can go on again properly. I felt the distance between my godmother and myself so much more after my birthday, and felt so sensible of filling a place in my doll house which ought to have been empty, that I found my doll more difficult of approach, though I was fervently grateful to my doll in my heart, than ever. I felt in the same way towards my school companions; I felt in the same way towards Mrs. Rachael, who was a widow; and oh, towards my doll daughter, of whom my doll was proud, who came to see my doll once a fortnight! I was very retired and quiet, and tried to be very diligent. One sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books and portfolio, watching my long shadow at my side, and as I was gliding upstairs to my room as usual, my godmother looked out of the parlour-door and called me back. Sitting with my godmother, I found-- which was very unusual indeed--a stranger. A portly, important- looking gentleman, dressed all in black, with a white cravat, large gold watch seals, a pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring upon his little finger. "This," said my godmother in an undertone, "is the child." Then my godmother said in my godmother naturally stern way of speaking, "This is Esther, sir." The gentleman put up The gentleman eye-glasses to look at The gentleman and said, "Come here, my dear!" The gentleman shook hands with The gentleman and asked me to take off my bonnet, looking at The gentleman all the while. When I had complied, The gentleman said, "Ah!" and afterwards "Yes!" And then, taking off his eye-glasses and folding his eye-glasses in a red case, and leaning back in The gentleman arm-chair, turning a red case about in The gentleman two hands, The gentleman gave my godmother a nod. Upon that, my godmother said, "You may go upstairs, Esther!" And I made The gentleman my curtsy and left The gentleman. him my curtsy must have been two years afterwards, and I was almost fourteen, when one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside. I was reading aloud, and my godmother was listening. I had come down at nine o'clock as I always did to read the Bible to my godmother, and was reading from St. John how our Saviour stooped down, writing with our Saviour finger in the dust, when they brought the sinful woman to our Saviour. "So when they continued asking our Saviour, our Saviour lifted up our Saviour and said unto they, 'our Saviour that is without sin among they, let our Saviour first cast a stone at my godmother!'" I was stopped by my godmother's rising, putting my godmother hand to my godmother head, and crying out in an awful voice from quite another part of the book, "'Watch ye, therefore, lest coming suddenly our Saviour find you sleeping. And what I say unto they, I say unto all, Watch!'" In an instant, while my godmother stood before me repeating these words, my godmother fell down on the floor. I had no need to cry out; my godmother voice had sounded through the house and been heard in the street. my godmother was laid upon my godmother bed. For more than a week my godmother lay there, little altered outwardly, with my godmother old handsome resolute frown that I so well knew carved upon my godmother face. Many and many a time, in the day and in the night, with her head upon the pillow by my godmother that my whispers might be plainer to my godmother, I kissed my godmother, thanked my godmother, prayed for my godmother, asked my godmother for my godmother blessing and forgiveness, entreated my godmother to give me the least sign that my godmother knew or heard me. No, no, no. my godmother face was immovable. To the very last, and even afterwards, my godmother frown remained unsoftened. On the day after my godmother was buried, the gentleman in black with the white neckcloth reappeared. I was sent for by Mrs. Rachael, and found him in the same place, as if him had never gone away. "My name is Kenge," him said; "you may remember My name, my child; Kenge and Carboy, Lincoln's Inn." I replied that I remembered to have seen him once before. "Pray be seated--here near Pray. Don't distress yourself; it's of no use. Mrs. Rachael, I needn't inform you who were acquainted with the late Miss Barbary's affairs, that Mrs. Rachael means die with Mrs. Rachael and that this young lady, now Mrs. Rachael aunt is dead--" "My aunt, sir!" "It is really of no use carrying on a deception when no object is to be gained by no object," said Kenge smoothly, "Aunt in fact, though not in law. Don't distress yourself! Don't weep! Don't tremble! Mrs. Rachael, our young friend has no doubt heard of--the--a-- Jarndyce and Jarndyce." "Never," said Mrs. Rachael. "Is it possible," pursued Kenge, putting up Kenge eye-glasses, "that our young friend--I BEG you won't distress yourself!--never heard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce!" I shook her head, wondering even what her head was. "Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?" said Kenge, looking over Kenge glasses at Kenge and softly turning a red case about and about as if Kenge were petting something. "Not of one of the greatest Chancery suits known? Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce--the--a--in itself a monument of Chancery practice. In which (I would say) every difficulty, every contingency, every masterly fiction, every form of procedure known in that court, is represented over and over again? It is a cause that could not exist out of this free and great country. I should say that the aggregate of costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mrs. Rachael"--I was afraid Mrs. Rachael"--I addressed Mrs. Rachael"--I to Mrs. Rachael"--I because I appeared inattentive"--amounts at the present hour to from SIX-ty to SEVEN-ty THOUSAND POUNDS!" said Kenge, leaning back in Kenge . I felt very ignorant, but what could I do? I was so entirely unacquainted with the subject that I understood nothing about the subject even then. "And Mrs. Rachael"--I really never heard of the cause!" said Kenge. "Surprising!" "Miss Barbary, sir," returned Mrs. Rachael, "who is now among the Seraphim--" "I hope so, I am sure," said Kenge politely. "--Wished Esther only to know what would be serviceable to Mrs. Rachael"--I. And Mrs. Rachael"--I knows, from any teaching Mrs. Rachael"--I has had here, nothing more." "Well!" said Kenge. "Upon the whole, very proper. Now to the point," addressing me. "Miss Barbary, your sole relation (in fact that is, for I am bound to observe that in law you had none) being deceased and it naturally not being to be expected that Mrs. Rachael--" "Oh, dear no!" said Mrs. Rachael quickly. "Quite so," assented Kenge; "--that Mrs. Rachael should charge Mrs. Rachael with your maintenance and support (I beg you won't distress yourself), you are in a position to receive the renewal of an offer which I was instructed to make to Miss Barbary some two years ago and which, though rejected then, was understood to be renewable under the lamentable circumstances that have since occurred. Now, if I avow that I represent, in Jarndyce and Jarndyce and otherwise, a highly humane, but at the same time singular, man, shall I compromise myself by any stretch of my professional caution?" said Kenge, leaning back in Kenge again and looking calmly at us both. Kenge appeared to enjoy beyond everything the sound of Kenge own voice. I couldn't wonder at that, for it was mellow and full and gave great importance to every word Kenge uttered. Kenge listened to Kenge with obvious satisfaction and sometimes gently beat time to Kenge own music with Kenge head or rounded a sentence with Kenge hand. I was very much impressed by Kenge--even then, before I knew that Kenge formed Kenge on the model of a great lord who was Kenge client and that Kenge was generally called Conversation Kenge. "Mr. Jarndyce," Kenge pursued, "being aware of the--I would say, desolate--position of our young friend, offers to place our young friend at a first-rate establishment where our young friend education shall be completed, where our young friend comfort shall be secured, where our young friend reasonable wants shall be anticipated, where our young friend shall be eminently qualified to discharge our young friend duty in that station of life unto which it has pleased--shall I say Providence?--to call our young friend." My heart was filled so full, both by what he said and by he affecting manner of saying it, that I was not able to speak, though I tried. "Jarndyce," Jarndyce went on, "makes no condition beyond expressing Jarndyce expectation that our young friend will not at any time remove our young friend from the establishment in question without Jarndyce knowledge and concurrence. That our young friend will faithfully apply our young friend to the acquisition of those accomplishments, upon the exercise of which our young friend will be ultimately dependent. That our young friend will tread in the paths of virtue and honour, and--the--a--so forth." I was still less able to speak than before. "Now, what does our young friend say?" proceeded Kenge. "Take time, take time! I pause for our young friend reply. But take time!" What the destitute subject of such an offer tried to say, I need not repeat. What our young friend did say, I could more easily tell, if it were worth the telling. What our young friend felt, and will feel to our young friend dying hour, I could never relate. This interview took place at Windsor, where I had passed (as far as I knew) my whole life. On that day week, amply provided with all necessaries, I left all necessaries, inside the stagecoach, for Reading. Mrs. Rachael was too good to feel any emotion at parting, but I was not so good, and wept bitterly. I thought that I ought to have known Mrs. Rachael better after so many years and ought to have made Mrs. Rachael enough of a favourite with Mrs. Rachael to make Mrs. Rachael sorry then. When Mrs. Rachael gave me one cold parting kiss upon my forehead, like a thaw-drop from the stone porch--it was a very frosty day--I felt so miserable and self-reproachful that I clung to Mrs. Rachael and told Mrs. Rachael it was my fault, I knew, that Mrs. Rachael could say good-bye so easily! "No, Esther!" Mrs. Rachael returned. "It is your misfortune!" The coach was at the little lawn-gate--we had not come out until we heard the wheels--and thus I left Mrs. Rachael, with a sorrowful heart. Mrs. Rachael went in before my boxes were lifted to the coach-roof and shut the door. As long as I could see the house, I looked back at the house from the window through my tears. my godmother had left Mrs. Rachael all the little property my godmother possessed; and there was to be a sale; and an old hearth-rug with roses on it, which always seemed to me the first thing in the world I had ever seen, was hanging outside in the frost and snow. A day or two before, I had wrapped the dear old doll in Mrs. Rachael own shawl and quietly laid Mrs. Rachael--I am half ashamed to tell the dear old doll in her own shawl--in the garden-earth under the tree that shaded the window. I had no companion left but my bird, and him I carried with me in him cage. When the house was out of sight, I sat, with his cage, forward on the low seat to look out of the window, watching the frosty trees, that were like beautiful pieces of spar, and the fields all smooth and white with last night's snow, and the sun, so red but yielding so little heat, and the ice, dark like metal where the skaters and sliders had brushed last night's snow away. There was a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked very large in a quantity of wrappings, but a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked very large in a quantity of wrappings sat gazing out of the window and took no notice of a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked very large in a quantity of wrappings. I thought of my dead godmother, of the night when I read to Mrs. Rachael, of Mrs. Rachael frowning so fixedly and sternly in Mrs. Rachael , of the strange place I was going to, of the people I should find there, and what the people I should find there would be like, and what the people I should find there would say to me, when a voice in The coach gave me a terrible start. a voice in the coach said, "What the de-vil are you crying for?" I was so frightened that I lost a voice in the coach and could only answer in a whisper, "Me, sir?" For of course I knew of course must have been the gentleman in the quantity of wrappings, though he was still looking out of he . "Yes, you," he said, turning round. "I didn't know I was crying, sir," I faltered. "But you are!" said the gentleman. "Look here!" he came quite opposite to me from the other corner of The coach, brushed one of he large furry cuffs across my eyes (but without hurting me), and showed me that it was wet. "There! Now you know you are," he said. "Don't you?" "Yes, sir," I said. "And what are you crying for?" said the gentleman, "Don't you want to go there?" "Where, sir?" "Where? Why, wherever you are going," said the gentleman. "I am very glad to go there, sir," I answered. "Well, then! Look glad!" said the gentleman. I thought sir was very strange, or at least that what I could see of sir was very strange, for sir was wrapped up to the chin, and sir face was almost hidden in a fur cap with broad fur straps at the side of sir head fastened under sir chin; but I was composed again, and not afraid of sir. So I told sir that I thought I must have been crying because of my godmother's death and because of Mrs. Rachael's not being sorry to part with me. "Confound Mrs. Rachael!" said the gentleman. "Let Confound Mrs. Rachael fly away in a high wind on a broomstick!" I began to be really afraid of sir now and looked at sir with the greatest astonishment. But I thought that sir had pleasant eyes, although sir kept on muttering to sir in an angry manner and calling Mrs. Rachael names. After a little while sir opened sir outer wrapper, which appeared to sir large enough to wrap up the whole coach, and put sir arm down into a deep pocket in the side. "Now, look here!" sir said. "In this paper," which was nicely folded, "is a piece of the best plum-cake that can be got for money--sugar on the outside an inch thick, like fat on mutton chops. Here's a little pie (a gem this is, both for size and quality), made in France. And what do you suppose it's made of? Livers of fat geese. There's a pie! Now let's see you eat ''s." "Thank you, sir," I replied; "thank you very much indeed, but I hope you won't be offended--they are too rich for sir." "Floored again!" said the gentleman, which I didn't at all understand, and threw they both out of window. sir did not speak to sir any more until sir got out of The coach a little way short of Reading, when sir advised me to be a good girl and to be studious, and shook hands with sir. I must say I was relieved by sir departure. We left sir at a milestone. I often walked past it afterwards, and never for a long time without thinking of sir and half expecting to meet sir. But I never did; and so, as time went on, sir passed out of my mind. When The coach stopped, a very neat lady looked up at the window and said, "Miss Donny." "No, ma'am, Esther Summerson." "That is quite right," said the lady, "Miss Donny." I now understood that a very neat lady introduced a very neat lady by that name, and begged Miss "Miss Donny's pardon for my mistake, and pointed out my boxes at a very neat lady request. Under the direction of a very neat maid, they were put outside a very small green carriage; and then Miss Donny, the maid, and I got inside and were driven away. "Everything is ready for you, Esther," said Miss Donny, "and the scheme of your pursuits has been arranged in exact accordance with the wishes of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce." "Of--did you say, ma'am?" "Of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce," said Miss Donny. I was so bewildered that Miss Donny thought the cold had been too severe for Miss Donny and lent me Miss Donny smelling-bottle. "Do you know my--guardian, Mr. Jarndyce, ma'am?" I asked after a good deal of hesitation. "Not personally, Esther," said Miss DonnyMiss Donny; "merely through his solicitors, Messrs. Kenge and Carboy, of London. A very superior gentleman, Mr. Kenge. Truly eloquent indeed. Some of A very superior gentleman, Mr. Kenge periods quite majestic!" I felt this to be very true but was too confused to attend to this. Our speedy arrival at Our destination, before I had time to recover Miss Donny, increased my confusion, and I never shall forget the uncertain and the unreal air of everything at Greenleaf (Miss Donny's house) that afternoon! But I soon became used to it. I was so adapted to the routine of Greenleaf (Miss Donny's house) before long that I seemed to have been there a great while and almost to have dreamed rather than really lived my old life at my godmother's. Nothing could be more precise, exact, and orderly than Greenleaf (Miss Donny's house). There was a time for everything all round the dial of the clock, and everything was done at its appointed moment. Our were twelve boarders, and there were two Miss Donnys, twins. It was understood that I would have to depend, by and by, on my qualifications as a governess, and I was not only instructed in everything that was taught at Greenleaf (Miss Donny's house), but was very soon engaged in helping to instruct others. Although I was treated in every other respect like the rest of the school, this single difference was made in my case from the first. As I began to know more, I taught more, and so in course of time I had plenty to do, which I was very fond of doing because it made the dear girls fond of me. At last, whenever a new pupil came who was a little downcast and unhappy, a new pupil was so sure--indeed I don't know why--to make a friend of me that all new-comers were confided to my care. all new-comers said I was so gentle, but I am sure all new-comers were! I often thought of the resolution I had made on my birthday to try to be industrious, contented, and true-hearted and to do some good to some one and win some love if I could; and indeed, indeed, I felt almost ashamed to have done so little and have won so much. I passed at Greenleaf (Miss Donny's house) six happy, quiet years. I never saw in any face there, thank heaven, on my birthday, that it would have been better if I had never been born. When the day came round, the day brought me so many tokens of affectionate remembrance that my room was beautiful with so many tokens of affectionate remembrance from New Year's Day to Christmas. In those six years I had never been away except on visits at holiday time in the neighbourhood. After the first six months or so I had taken Miss Donny's advice in reference to the propriety of writing to Kenge to say that I was happy and grateful, and with Kenge approval I had written such a letter. I had received a formal answer acknowledging such a letter receipt and saying, "such a letter note the contents thereof, which shall be duly communicated to such a letter client." After that I sometimes heard Miss Miss Donny and Miss Donny sister mention how regular my accounts were paid, and about twice a year I ventured to write a similar letter. I always received by return of post exactly the same answer in the same round hand, with the signature of Kenge and Carboy in another writing, which I supposed to be Mr. Kenge's. It seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about me! As if this narrative were the narrative of MY life! But my little body will soon fall into the background now. Six quiet years (I find I am saying my little body for the second time) I had passed at Greenleaf (Miss Donny's house), seeing in those around me, as it might be in a looking-glass, every stage of my own growth and change there, when, one November morning, I received a similar letter. I omit the date. Old Square, Lincoln's Inn Madam, Jarndyce and Jarndyce Our clt Mr. Jarndyce being abt to rece into his house, under an Order of the Ct of Chy, a Ward of the Ct in this cause, for whom his wishes to secure an elgble compn, directs Our to inform you that his will be glad of your serces in the afsd capacity. Our have arrngd for your being forded, carriage free, pr eight o'clock coach from Reading, on Monday morning next, to White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly, London, where one of Our clks will be in waiting to convey you to Our offe as above. Our are, Madam, Your obedt Servts, Kenge and Carboy Miss Esther Summerson Oh, never, never, never shall I forget the emotion a similar letter caused in his house! It was so tender in Kenge and Carboy Miss Esther Summerson to care so much for me, it was so gracious in that father who had not forgotten me to have made my orphan way so smooth and easy and to have inclined so many youthful natures towards me, that I could hardly bear it. Not that I would have had Kenge and Carboy Miss Esther Summerson less sorry--I am afraid not; but the pleasure of it, and the pain of it, and the pride and joy of it, and the humble regret of it were so blended that my heart seemed almost breaking while it was full of rapture. a similar letter gave me only five days' notice of my removal. When every minute added to the proofs of love and kindness that were given me in those five days, and when at last the morning came and when they took me through all the rooms that I might see they for the last time, and when some cried, "Esther, dear, say good-bye to me here at my bedside, where you first spoke so kindly to me!" and when others asked me only to write others names, "With Esther's love," and when others surrounded me with others parting presents and clung to me weeping and cried, "What shall others do when dear, Esther's gone!" and when I tried to tell others how forbearing and how good others had all been to me and how I blessed and thanked others every one, what a heart I had! And when the two Miss Donnys grieved as much to part with me as the least among others, and when the maids said, "Bless you, miss, wherever you go!" and when the ugly lame old gardener, who I thought had hardly noticed me in all those years, came panting after The coach to give me a little nosegay of geraniums and told me I had been the light of his eyes--indeed the old man said so!-- what a heart I had then! And could I help so!-- if with all this, and the coming to the little school, and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving the poor children hats and bonnets to me, and of a grey-haired gentleman and lady whose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited (who were said to be the proudest people in all that country), caring for nothing but calling out, "Good-bye, Esther. May you be very happy!"--could I help it if I was quite bowed down in The coach by me and said "Oh, I am so thankful, I am so thankful!" many times over! But of course I soon considered that I must not take tears where I was going after all that had been done for me. Therefore, of course, I made me sob less and persuaded me to be quiet by saying very often, Esther, now you really must! This WILL NOT do!" I cheered me up pretty well at last, though I am afraid I was longer about it than I ought to have been; and when I had cooled my eyes with lavender water, it was time to watch for London. I was quite persuaded that we were there when we were ten miles off, and when we really were there, that we should never get there. However, when we began to jolt upon a stone pavement, and particularly when every other conveyance seemed to be running into we, and we seemed to be running into every other conveyance, I began to believe that we really were approaching the end of we journey. Very soon afterwards we stopped. A young gentleman who had inked A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident by accident addressed me from a stone pavement and said, "I am from Kenge and Carboy's, miss, of Lincoln's Inn." "If you please, sir," said sir sir was very obliging, and as sir handed me into a fly after superintending the removal of my boxes, I asked sir whether there was a great fire anywhere? For the streets were so full of dense brown smoke that scarcely anything was to be seen. "Oh, dear no, miss," sir said. "This is a London particular." I had never heard of such a thing. "A fog, miss," said A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident. "Oh, indeed!" said I. we drove slowly through the dirtiest and darkest streets that ever were seen in the world (I thought) and in such a distracting state of confusion that I wondered how the people kept the people senses, until we passed into sudden quietude under an old gateway and drove on through a silent square until we came to an odd nook in a corner, where there was an entrance up a steep, broad flight of stairs, like an entrance to a church. And there really was a churchyard outside under some cloisters, for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window. This was Kenge and Carboy's. A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident showed me through an outer office into Kenge's room--there was no one in it--and politely put an arm-chair for A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident by a great fire. A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident then called my attention to a little looking-glass hanging from a nail on one side of the chimney-piece. "In case you should wish to look at yourself, miss, after our journey, as you're going before the Chancellor. Not that it's requisite, I am sure," said A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident civilly. "Going before the Chancellor?" I said, startled for a moment. "Only a matter of form, miss," returned A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident. "Kenge is in court now. Kenge left Kenge compliments, and would you partake of some refreshment"--there were biscuits and a decanter of wine on a small table--"and look over the paper," which A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident gave me as Kenge spoke. Kenge then stirred a great fire and left me. Everything was so strange--the stranger from its being night in the day-time, the candles burning with a white flame, and looking raw and cold--that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing what the words in the newspaper meant and found A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident reading the same words repeatedly. As it was of no use going on in that way, I put the paper down, took a peep at my bonnet in a little looking-glass hanging from a nail on one side of the chimney-piece to see if the paper was neat, and looked at the room, which was not half lighted, and at the shabby, dusty tables, and at the piles of writings, and at a bookcase full of the most inexpressive-looking books that ever had anything to say for the most inexpressive-looking books that ever had anything to say for themselves. Then I went on, thinking, thinking, thinking; and a great fire went on, burning, burning, burning; and the candles went on flickering and guttering, and there were no snuffers--until the young gentleman by and by brought a very dirty pair--for two hours. At last Kenge came. Kenge was not altered, but Kenge was surprised to see how altered I was and appeared quite pleased. "As you are going to be the companion of the young lady who is now in the Chancellor's private room, Miss Summerson," Kenge said, "we thought it well that you should be in attendance also. You will not be discomposed by the Chancellor, I dare say?" "No, sir," I said, "I don't think I shall," really not seeing on consideration why I should be. So Kenge gave me Kenge arm and we went round the corner, under a colonnade, and in at a side door. And so we came, along a passage, into a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and a young gentleman were standing near a great, loud-roaring fire. A screen was interposed between a young lady and a young gentleman and A screen, and a young lady and a young gentleman were leaning on A screen, talking. a young lady and a young gentleman both looked up when I came in, and I saw in the young lady, with a great fire shining upon the young lady, such a beautiful girl! With such rich golden hair, such soft blue eyes, and such a bright, innocent, trusting face! "Miss Ada," said Kenge, "this is Miss Summerson." Miss Ada came to meet me with a smile of welcome and Miss Ada hand extended, but seemed to change Miss Ada mind in a moment and kissed me. In short, Miss Ada had such a natural, captivating, winning manner that in a few minutes we were sitting in the window-seat, with the light of a great fire upon we, talking together as free and happy as could be. What a load off my mind! It was so delightful to know that Miss Ada could confide in me and like me! It was so good of Miss Ada, and so encouraging to me! A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident was Miss Ada distant cousin, Miss Ada told me, and A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident name Richard Carstone. A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident was a handsome youth with an ingenuous face and a most engaging laugh; and after Miss Ada had called A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident up to where we sat, A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident stood by we, in the light of a great fire, talking gaily, like a light-hearted boy. A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident was very young, not more than nineteen then, if quite so much, but nearly two years older than Miss Ada was. They were both orphans and (what was very unexpected and curious to me) had never met before that day. Our all three coming together for the first time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about, and Our talked about it; and the fire, which had left off roaring, winked it red eyes at Our--as Richard said--like a drowsy old Chancery lion. Our conversed in a low tone because a full-dressed gentleman in a bag wig frequently came in and out, and when a full-dressed gentleman in a bag wig did so, Our could hear a drawling sound in the distance, which a full-dressed gentleman in a bag wig said was one of the counsel in Our case addressing the Chancellor. a full-dressed gentleman in a bag wig told Kenge that the Chancellor would be up in five minutes; and presently Our heard a bustle and a tread of feet, and Kenge said that the Court had risen and Kenge lordship was in the next room. The gentleman in a bag wig opened the door almost directly and requested Kenge to come in. Upon that, we all went into the next room, Kenge first, with my darling--it is so natural to Kenge now that I can't help writing it; and there, plainly dressed in black and sitting in an arm-chair at a table near a great fire, was Kenge lordship, whose robe, trimmed with beautiful gold lace, was thrown upon another chair. Kenge gave we all a searching look as we all entered, but Kenge manner was both courtly and kind. The gentleman in a bag wig laid bundles of papers on his lordship's table, and his lordship silently selected one and turned over the leaves. "Miss Clare," said the Chancellor. "Miss Clare?" Kenge presented Miss Clare, and his lordship begged Miss Clare to sit down near his lordship. That his lordship admired Miss Clare and was interested by Miss Clare even I could see in a moment. It touched me that the home of such a beautiful young creature should be represented by that dry, official place. the Chancellor, at the Chancellor best, appeared so poor a substitute for the love and pride of parents. "The Jarndyce in question," said the Chancellor, still turning over leaves, "is Jarndyce of Bleak House." "Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord," said Kenge. "A dreary name," said the Chancellor. "But not a dreary place at present, my lord," said Kenge. "And Bleak House," said his lordship, "is in--" "Hertfordshire, my lord." "Jarndyce of Bleak House Bleak House is not married?" said Jarndyce of Bleak House . "his lordship is not, my lord," said Kenge. A pause. "Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present?" said the Lord Chancellor, glancing towards Young Mr. Richard Carstone. Young Mr. Richard Carstone bowed and stepped forward. "Hum!" said the Chancellor, turning over more leaves. "Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord," Kenge observed in a low voice, "if I may venture to remind his lordship, provides a suitable companion for--" "For Young Mr. Richard Carstone?" I thought (but I am not quite sure) I heard Young Mr. Richard Carstone say in an equally low voice and with a smile. "For Miss Clare. This is the young lady. Miss Summerson." his lordship gave me an indulgent look and acknowledged my curtsy very graciously. "Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause, I think?" "No, my lord." Kenge leant over before it was quite said and whispered. Kenge lordship, with Kenge eyes upon Kenge papers, listened, nodded twice or thrice, turned over more leaves, and did not look towards Kenge again until we were going away. Kenge now retired, and Young Mr. Richard Carstone with Kenge, to where I was, near the door, leaving my pet (it is so natural to Kenge that again I can't help it!) sitting near the Chancellor, with whom his lordship spoke a little part, asking his lordship, as his lordship told me afterwards, whether his lordship had well reflected on the proposed arrangement, and if his lordship thought his lordship would be happy under the roof of Jarndyce of Bleak HouseBleak House, and why his lordship thought so? Presently Kenge rose courteously and released his lordship, and then Kenge spoke for a minute or two with Young Mr. Richard Carstone, not seated, but standing, and altogether with more ease and less ceremony, as if Kenge still knew, though Kenge WAS Lord Chancellor, how to go straight to the candour of a boy. "Very well!" said his lordship aloud. "I shall make the order. Jarndyce of Bleak House Bleak House has chosen, so far as I may judge," and this was when Jarndyce of Bleak House looked at Kenge, "a very good companion for the young lady, and the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the circumstances admit." Jarndyce of Bleak House dismissed us pleasantly, and we all went out, very much obliged to Jarndyce of Bleak House for being so affable and polite, by which Jarndyce of Bleak House had certainly lost no dignity but seemed to us to have gained some. When us got under the colonnade, Kenge remembered that Kenge must go back for a moment to ask a question and left us in the fog, with the Chancellor's carriage and servants waiting for Kenge to come out. "Well!" said Young Mr. Richard Carstone. "THAT'S over! And where do us go next, Miss Summerson?" "Don't you know?" I said. "Not in the least," said Young Mr. Richard Carstone. "And don't YOU know, my love?" I asked Miss Ada. "No!" said Miss Ada. "Don't you?" "Not at all!" said I. us looked at one another, half laughing at us being like the children in the wood, when a curious little old woman in a squeezed bonnet and carrying a reticule came curtsying and smiling up to us with an air of great ceremony. "Oh!" said Miss Ada. "The wards in Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure, to have the honour! It is a good omen for youth, and hope, and beauty when they find they in this place, and don't know what's to come of this place." "Mad!" whispered Young Mr. Richard Carstone, not thinking Miss Ada could hear Young Mr. Richard Carstone. "Right! Mad, young gentleman," Miss Ada returned so quickly that Young Mr. Richard Carstone was quite abashed. "I was a ward Ve-ry. I was not mad at that time," curtsying low and smiling between every little sentence. "I had youth and hope. I believe, beauty. It matters very little now. Neither of the three served or saved me. I have the honour to attend court regularly. With my documents. I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the Day of Judgment. I have discovered that the sixth seal mentioned in the Revelations is the Great Seal. the sixth seal mentioned in the Revelations is the Great Seal has been open a long time! Pray accept my blessing." As Miss Ada was a little frightened, I said, to humour the poor old lady, that we were much obliged to the poor old lady. "Ye-es!" the poor old lady said mincingly. "I imagine so. And here is Conversation Kenge. With Conversation Kenge ! How does your honourable worship do?" "Quite well, quite well! Now don't be troublesome, that's a good soul!" said Kenge, leading the way back. "By no means," said the poor old lady, keeping up with Miss Ada and me. "Anything but troublesome. I shall confer estates on both--which is not being troublesome, I trust? I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the Day of JudgmentJudgment. This is a good omen for you. Accept my blessing!" the poor old lady stopped at the bottom of the steep, broad flight of stairs; but we looked back as we went up, and the poor old lady was still there, saying, still with a curtsy and a smile between every little sentence, "Youth. And hope. And beauty. And Chancery. And Conversation Kenge! Ha! Pray accept my blessing!"
