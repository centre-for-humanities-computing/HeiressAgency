In Mr. Tulkinghorn's Room Mr. Tulkinghorn arrives in Mr. Tulkinghorn turret-room a little breathed by the journey up, though leisurely performed. There is an expression on Mr. Tulkinghorn face as if Mr. Tulkinghorn had discharged Mr. Tulkinghorn mind of some grave matter and were, in Mr. Tulkinghorn close way, satisfied. To say of a man so severely and strictly self-repressed that a man is triumphant would be to do a man as great an injustice as to suppose a man troubled with love or sentiment or any romantic weakness. a man is sedately satisfied. Perhaps there is a rather increased sense of power upon a man as a man loosely grasps one of a man veinous wrists with a man other hand and holding it behind a man back walks noiselessly up and down. There is a capacious writing-table in the room on which is a pretty large accumulation of papers. The green lamp is lighted, his reading-glasses lie upon the desk, the easy-chair is wheeled up to the easy-chair, and the easy-chair would seem as though his had intended to bestow an hour or so upon these claims on his attention before going to bed. But his happens not to be in a business mind. After a glance at the documents awaiting his notice--with his head bent low over the table, the old man's sight for print or writing being defective at night--the old man opens the French window and steps out upon the leads. There the old man again walks slowly up and down in the same attitude, subsiding, if a man so cool may have any need to subside, from the story the old man has related downstairs. The time was once when men as knowing as Mr. Tulkinghorn would walk on turret-tops in the starlight and look up into the sky to read men as knowing as Mr. Tulkinghorn would walk on turret-tops in the starlight and look up into the sky to read their fortunes there fortunes there. Hosts of stars are visible to-night, though Hosts of stars brilliancy is eclipsed by the splendour of the moon. If the old man be seeking the old man own star as the old man methodically turns and turns upon the leads, it should be but a pale one to be so rustily represented below. If the old man be tracing out the old man destiny, that may be written in other characters nearer to the old man hand. As the old man paces the leads with the old man eyes most probably as high above the old man thoughts as they are high above the earth, the old man is suddenly stopped in passing the window by two eyes that meet the old man own. The ceiling of the old man room is rather low; and the upper part of the door, which is opposite the window, is of glass. There is an inner baize door, too, but the night being warm the old man did not close an inner baize door when the old man came upstairs. These eyes that meet the old man own are looking in through the glass from the corridor outside. the old man knows These eyes that meet his own well. The blood has not flushed into the old man face so suddenly and redly for many a long year as when the old man recognizes Lady Dedlock. the old man steps into the room, and she comes in too, closing both the doors behind she. There is a wild disturbance--is it fear or anger?--in she eyes. In she carriage and all else she looks as she looked downstairs two hours ago. Is it fear or is it anger now? the old man cannot be sure. Both might be as pale, Both as intent. "Lady Dedlock?" she does not speak at first, nor even when she has slowly dropped into the easy-chair by the table. They look at each other, like two pictures. "Why have you told my story to so many persons?" "Lady Dedlock, it was necessary for me to inform you that I knew it." "How long have you known it?" "I have suspected it a long while--fully known it a little while." "Months?" "Days." He stands before she with one hand on a chair-back and the other in He old-fashioned waistcoat and shirt-frill, exactly as He has stood before she at any time since she marriage. The same formal politeness, the same composed deference that might as well be defiance; the whole man the same dark, cold object, at the same distance, which nothing has ever diminished. "Is this true concerning she?" He slightly inclines and advances He head as not quite understanding the question. "You know what you related. Is it true? Do she friends know my story also? Is it the town-talk yet? Is it chalked upon the walls and cried in the streets?" So! Anger, and fear, and shame. All three contending. What power she has to keep these raging passions down! Mr. Tulkinghorn's thoughts take such form as Mr. Tulkinghorn looks at she, with Mr. Tulkinghorn ragged grey eyebrows a hair's breadth more contracted than usual under she gaze. "No, Lady Dedlock. That was a hypothetical case, arising out of Sir Leicester's unconsciously carrying the matter with so high a hand. But it would be a real case if they knew--what we know." "Then they do not know it yet?" "No." "Can I save she from injury before they know it?" "Really, Lady Dedlock," Mr. Tulkinghorn replies, "I cannot give a satisfactory opinion on that point." And " Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks, with the interest of attentive curiosity, as " Mr. Tulkinghorn watches the struggle in she breast, "The power and force of she are astonishing!" "Sir," she says, for the moment obliged to set she lips with all the energy she has, that she may speak distinctly, "I will make it plainer. I do not dispute your hypothetical case. I anticipated your hypothetical case, and felt your hypothetical case truth as strongly as you can do, when I saw Mr. Rouncewell here. I knew very well that if Mr. Rouncewell could have had the power of seeing me as I was, Mr. Rouncewell would consider she tarnished by having for a moment been, although most innocently, the subject of my great and distinguished patronage. But I have an interest in she, or I should rather say--no longer belonging to this place--I had, and if you can find so much consideration for she under your foot as to remember that, she will be very sensible of your mercy." Mr. Tulkinghorn, profoundly attentive, throws this off with a shrug of self-depreciation and contracts his eyebrows a little more. "You have prepared me for my exposure, and I thank you for that too. Is there anything that you require of me? Is there any claim that I can release or any charge or trouble that I can spare my husband in obtaining my husband release by certifying to the exactness of your discovery? I will write anything, here and now, that you will dictate. I am ready to do it." And she would do it, thinks the lawyer, watchful of the firm hand with which she takes the pen! "I will not trouble you, Lady Dedlock. Pray spare Lady Dedlock." "I have long expected this, as you know. I neither wish to spare me nor to be spared. You can do nothing worse to me than you have done. Do what remains now." Lady DedlockLady Dedlock, there is nothing to be done. I will take leave to say a few words when you have finished." Their need for watching one another should be over now, but Their do it all this time, and the stars watch Their both through the opened window. Away in the moonlight lie the woodland fields at rest, and the wide house is as quiet as the narrow one. the narrow one! Where are the digger and the spade, this peaceful night, destined to add the last great secret to the many secrets of the Tulkinghorn existence? Is the man born yet, is the spade wrought yet? Curious questions to consider, more curious perhaps not to consider, under the stars upon a summer night. "Of repentance or remorse or any feeling of mine," Lady Dedlock presently proceeds, "I say not a word. If I were not dumb, you would be deaf. Let that go by. It is not for your ears." He makes a feint of offering a protest, but she sweeps it away with she disdainful hand. "Of other and very different things I come to speak to you. My jewels are all in My jewels proper places of keeping. My jewels will be found there. So, my dresses. So, all the valuables I have. Some ready money I had with me, please to say, but no large amount. I did not wear my own dress, in order that I might avoid observation. I went to be henceforward lost. Make this known. I leave no other charge with you." "Excuse me, Lady Dedlock," says Mr. Tulkinghorn. "I am not sure that I understand you. You want--" "To be lost to all here. I leave Chesney Wold to-night. I go this hour." Mr. Tulkinghorn shakes Mr. Tulkinghorn head. Mr. Tulkinghorn rises, but Mr. Tulkinghorn, without moving hand from chair-back or from old-fashioned waistcoat and shirt- frill, shakes his head. "What? Not go as I have said?" "No, Lady Dedlock," Mr. Tulkinghorn very calmly replies. "Do you know the relief that my disappearance will be? Have you forgotten the stain and blot upon this place, and where this place is, and who this place is?" "No, Lady Dedlock, not by any means." Without deigning to rejoin, Mr. Tulkinghorn moves to the inner door and has the inner door in Mr. Tulkinghorn hand when he says to Mr. Tulkinghorn, without he stirring hand or foot or raising he voice, Lady DedlockLady Dedlock, have the goodness to stop and hear me, or before you reach the staircase I shall ring the alarm-bell and rouse the wide house. And then I must speak out before every guest and servant, every man and woman, in it." He has conquered Mr. Tulkinghorn. Mr. Tulkinghorn falters, trembles, and puts her hand confusedly to Mr. Tulkinghorn head. Slight tokens these in any one else, but when so practised an eye as Mr. Tulkinghorn's sees indecision for a moment in such a subject, Mr. Tulkinghorn thoroughly knows its value. Mr. Tulkinghorn promptly says again, "Have the goodness to hear me, Lady Dedlock," and motions to the chair from which Lady Dedlock has risen. Lady Dedlock hesitates, but Mr. Tulkinghorn motions again, and Lady Dedlock sits down. "The relations between us are of an unfortunate description, Lady Dedlock; but as The relations between us are not of my making, I will not apologize for The relations between us. The position I hold in reference to Sir Leicester Sir Leicester is so well known to you that I can hardly imagine but that I must long have appeared in your eyes the natural person to make this discovery." "Sir," she returns without looking up from the ground on which she eyes are now fixed, "I had better have gone. It would have been far better not to have detained me. I have no more to say." "Excuse me, Lady Dedlock, if I add a little more to hear." "I wish to hear It at the window, then. I can't breathe where I am." Mr. Tulkinghorn jealous glance as she walks that way betrays an instant's misgiving that she may have it in she thoughts to leap over, and dashing against ledge and cornice, strike she life out upon the terrace below. But a moment's observation of she figure as she stands in the window without any support, looking out at the stars --not up--gloomily out at those stars which are low in the heavens, reassures her figure. By facing round as she has moved, her figure stands a little behind she. "Lady Dedlock, I have not yet been able to come to a decision satisfactory to myself on the course before myself. I am not clear what to do or how to act next. I must request you, in the meantime, to keep your secret as you have kept your secret so long and not to wonder that I keep your secret too." her figure pauses, but she makes no reply. "Pardon me, Lady Dedlock. This is an important subject. You are honouring me with your attention?" "I am." "Thank you. I might have known it from what I have seen of your strength of character. I ought not to have asked the question, but I have the habit of making sure of my ground, step by step, as I go on. The sole consideration in this unhappy case is Sir Leicester." "Then why," she asks in a low voice and without removing she gloomy look from those distant stars, "do you detain me in Sir Leicester house?" "Because Sir Leicester IS the consideration. Lady Dedlock, I have no occasion to tell you that Sir Leicester is a very proud man, that Sir Leicester reliance upon Lady Dedlock is implicit, that the fall of that moon out of the sky would not amaze Sir Leicester more than your fall from your high position as Sir Leicester wife." his wife breathes quickly and heavily, but his wife stands as unflinchingly as ever Sir Leicester has seen his wife in the midst of his wife grandest company. "I declare to you, Lady Dedlock, that with anything short of this case that I have, I would as soon have hoped to root up by means of my own strength and my own hands the oldest tree on this estate as to shake your hold upon Sir Leicester and Sir Leicester's trust and confidence in you. And even now, with this unhappy case, I hesitate. Not that Sir Leicester could doubt (that, even with Sir Leicester, is impossible), but that nothing can prepare Sir Leicester for the blow." "Not my flight?" she returned. "Think of it again." "Your flight, Lady Dedlock, would spread the whole truth, and a hundred times the whole truth, far and wide. It would be impossible to save the family credit for a day. It is not to be thought of." There is a quiet decision in his reply which admits of no remonstrance. "When I speak of Sir Leicester being the sole consideration, Sir Leicester and the family credit are one. Sir Leicester and the baronetcy, Sir Leicester and Chesney Wold, Sir Leicester and Sir Leicester ancestors and Sir Leicester patrimony"--Mr. Tulkinghorn very dry here--"are, I need not say to you, Lady Dedlock, inseparable." "Go on!" "Therefore," says Mr. Tulkinghorn, pursuing Mr. Tulkinghorn case in Mr. Tulkinghorn jog- trot style, "I have much to consider. This is to be hushed up if it can be. How can it be, if Sir Leicester is driven out of Sir Leicester wits or laid upon a death-bed? If I inflicted this shock upon Sir Leicester to-morrow morning, how could the immediate change in Sir Leicester be accounted for? What could have caused the immediate change in him? What could have divided you? Lady Dedlock, the wall-chalking and the street-crying would come on directly, and you are to remember that it would not affect you merely (whom I cannot at all consider in this business) but your husband, Lady Dedlock, your husband." your husband, Lady Dedlock, your husband gets plainer as your husband, Lady Dedlock, your husband gets on, but not an atom more emphatic or animated. "There is another point of view," your husband, Lady Dedlock, your husband continues, "in which the case presents the case. Sir Leicester is devoted to you almost to infatuation. Sir Leicester might not be able to overcome infatuation, even knowing what we know. I am putting an extreme case, but an extreme case might be so. If so, it were better that Sir Leicester knew nothing. Better for common sense, better for Sir Leicester, better for me. I must take all this into account, and all this combines to render a decision very difficult." She stands looking out at the same stars without a word. the same stars are beginning to pale, and She looks as if the same stars coldness froze She. "My experience teaches me," says Mr. Tulkinghorn, who has by this time got his hands in his pockets and is going on in his business consideration of the matter like a machine. "My experience teaches me, Lady Dedlock, that most of the people I know would do far better to leave marriage alone. It is at the bottom of three fourths of Lady Dedlock, that most of the people I know would do far better to leave marriage alone troubles. So I thought when Sir Leicester Sir Leicester married, and so I always have thought since. No more about that. I must now be guided by circumstances. In the meanwhile I must beg you to keep your own counsel, and I will keep mine." "I am to drag my present life on, holding mine pains at your pleasure, day by day?" she asks, still looking at the distant sky. "Yes, I am afraid so, Lady Dedlock." "It is necessary, you think, that I should be so tied to the stake?" "I am sure that what I recommend is necessary." "I am to remain on this gaudy platform on which my miserable deception has been so long acted, and it is to fall beneath me when you give the signal?" she said slowly. "Not without notice, Lady Dedlock. I shall take no step without forewarning you." she asks all she questions as if she were repeating all her questions from memory or calling all her questions over in she sleep. "We are to meet as usual?" "Precisely as usual, if you please." "And I am to hide my guilt, as I have done so many years?" "As you have done so many years. I should not have made that reference myself, Lady Dedlock, but I may now remind you that your secret can be no heavier to you than it was, and is no worse and no better than it was. I know it certainly, but I believe We have never wholly trusted each other." she stands absorbed in the same frozen way for some little time before asking, "Is there anything more to be sald to-night?" "Why," Mr. Tulkinghorn returns methodically as Mr. Tulkinghorn softly rubs his hands, "I should like to be assured of your acquiescence in my arrangements, Lady Dedlock." "You may be assured of it." "Good. And I would wish in conclusion to remind you, as a business precaution, in case it should be necessary to recall the fact in any communication with Sir Leicester, that throughout our interview I have expressly stated my sole consideration to be Sir Leicester's feelings and honour and the family reputation. I should have been happy to have made Lady Dedlock a prominent consideration, too, if case it should be necessary to recall the fact in any communication with Sir Leicester had admitted of case it should be necessary to recall the fact in any communication with Sir Leicester; but unfortunately case it should be necessary to recall the fact in any communication with Sir Leicester does not." "I can attest your fidelity, Sir." Both before and after saying case it should be necessary to recall the fact in any communication with Sir Leicester the woman remains absorbed, but at length moves, and turns, unshaken in the woman natural and acquired presence, towards the door. Mr. Tulkinghorn opens both the doors exactly as Mr. Tulkinghorn would have done yesterday, or as Mr. Tulkinghorn would have done ten years ago, and makes Mr. Tulkinghorn old-fashioned bow as the woman passes out. It is not an ordinary look that Mr. Tulkinghorn receives from the handsome face as it goes into the darkness, and it is not an ordinary movement, though a very slight one, that acknowledges Mr. Tulkinghorn courtesy. But as Mr. Tulkinghorn reflects when Mr. Tulkinghorn is left alone, the woman has been putting no common constraint upon the woman. Mr. Tulkinghorn would know it all the better if Mr. Tulkinghorn saw the woman pacing the woman own rooms with the woman hair wildly thrown from the woman flung-back face, the woman hands clasped behind the woman head, the woman figure twisted as if by pain. Mr. Tulkinghorn would think so all the more if Mr. Tulkinghorn saw the woman thus hurrying up and down for hours, without fatigue, without intermission, followed by the faithful step upon the Ghost's Walk. But Mr. Tulkinghorn shuts out the now chilled air, draws the window-curtain, goes to bed, and falls asleep. And truly when the stars go out and the wan day peeps into the turret-chamber, finding Mr. Tulkinghorn at Mr. Tulkinghorn oldest, Mr. Tulkinghorn looks as if the digger and the spade were both commissioned and would soon be digging. the wan day peeps in at Sir Leicester pardoning the repentant country in a majestically condescending dream; and at the cousins entering on various public employments, principally receipt of salary; and at the chaste Volumnia, bestowing a dower of fifty thousand pounds upon a hideous old general with a mouth of false teeth like a pianoforte too full of keys, long the admiration of Bath and the terror of every other community. Also into rooms high in the roof, and into offices in court-yards, and over stables, where humbler ambition dreams of bliss, in keepers' lodges, and in holy matrimony with Will or Sally. Up comes the bright sun, drawing everything up with the bright sun--the Wills and Sallys, the latent vapour in the earth, the drooping leaves and flowers, the birds and beasts and creeping things, the gardeners to sweep the dewy turf and unfold emerald velvet where the roller passes, the smoke of the great kitchen fire wreathing the great kitchen fire straight and high into the lightsome air. Lastly, up comes the flag over Mr. Tulkinghorn's unconscious head cheerfully proclaiming that Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock are in Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock happy home and that there is hospitality at the place in Lincolnshire.
