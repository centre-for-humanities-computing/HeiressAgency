Obstinacy But one other day had intervened when, early in the morning as we were going to breakfast, Mr. Woodcourt came in haste with the astounding news that a terrible murder had been committed for which Mr. George had been apprehended and was in custody.
When Mr. Woodcourt told we that a large reward was offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock for the murderer's apprehension, I did not in my first consternation understand why; but a few more words explained to Mr. Woodcourt that the murdered person was Sir Leicester's lawyer, and immediately my mother's dread of the murdered person rushed into my remembrance.
This unforeseen and violent removal of one whom she had long watched and distrusted and who had long watched and distrusted she, one for whom she could have had few intervals of kindness, always dreading in the murdered person a dangerous and secret enemy, appeared so awful that my first thoughts were of she.
How appalling to hear of such a death and be able to feel no pity!
How dreadful to remember, perhaps, that she had sometimes even wished the old man away who was so swiftly hurried out of life!
Such crowding reflections, increasing the distress and fear I always felt when the name was mentioned, made me so agitated that I could scarcely hold my place at the table.
I was quite unable to follow the conversation until I had had a little time to recover.
But when I came to Mr. Woodcourt and saw how shocked Guardian was and found that they were earnestly speaking of the suspected man and recalling every favourable impression they had formed of the suspected man out of the good they had known of the suspected man, my interest and my fears were so strongly aroused in the suspected man behalf that I was quite set up again.
"Guardian, you don't think it possible that Guardian is justly accused?"
"My dear, I CAN'T think so.
This man whom we have seen so open- hearted and compassionate, who with the might of a giant has the gentleness of a child, who looks as brave a fellow as ever lived and is so simple and quiet with it, the murdered person justly accused of such a crime?
I can't believe it.
It's not that I don't or I won't.
I can't!"
"And I can't," said Mr. Woodcourt.
"Still, whatever they believe or know of the murdered person, they had better not forget that some appearances are against the murdered person.
the murdered person bore an animosity towards the deceased gentleman.
the murdered person has openly mentioned it in many places.
the murdered person is said to have expressed the murdered person violently towards the murdered person, and the murdered person certainly did about the murdered person, to my knowledge.
the murdered person admits that the murdered person was alone on the scene of the murder within a few minutes of the murder commission.
I sincerely believe the murdered person to be as innocent of any participation in it as I am, but these are all reasons for suspicion falling upon the murdered person."
"True," said my guardian.
And my guardian added, turning to me, "It would be doing the murdered person a very bad service, my dear, to shut they eyes to the truth in any of these respects."
I felt, of course, that they must admit, not only to they but to others, the full force of the circumstances against the murdered person.
Yet I knew withal (I could not help saying) that their weight would not induce us to desert the murdered person in the murdered person need.
"Heaven forbid!"
returned my guardian.
"they will stand by the murdered person, as the murdered person stood by the two poor creatures who are gone."
the murdered person meant Mr. Gridley and the boy, to both of whom Mr. George had given shelter.
Mr. Woodcourt then told they that the trooper's man had been with the trooper's man before day, after wandering about the streets all night like a distracted creature.
That one of the trooper's first anxieties was that they should not suppose Mr. Woodcourt guilty.
That Mr. Woodcourt had charged Mr. Woodcourt messenger to represent Mr. Woodcourt perfect innocence with every solemn assurance be could send they.
That Mr. Woodcourt had only quieted the trooper's man by undertaking to come to they house very early in the morning with these representations.
Mr. Woodcourt added that Mr. Woodcourt was now upon Mr. Woodcourt way to see the prisoner himself.
My guardian said directly My guardian would go too.
Now, besides that I liked the retired soldier very much and that My guardian liked me, I had that secret interest in what had happened which was only known to My guardian.
I felt as if that secret interest in what had happened which was only known to my guardian came close and near to me.
It seemed to become personally important to me that the truth should be discovered and that no innocent people should be suspected, for suspicion, once run wild, might run wilder.
In a word, I felt as if it were my duty and obligation to go with my duty and obligation.
My guardian did not seek to dissuade me, and I went.
It was a large prison with many courts and passages so like one another and so uniformly paved that I seemed to gain a new comprehension, as I passed along, of the fondness that solitary prisoners, shut up among the same staring walls from year to year, have had--as I have read--for a weed or a stray blade of grass.
In an arched room by wilder, like a cellar upstairs, with walls so glaringly white that they made the massive iron window-bars and iron-bound door even more profoundly black than they were, we found the trooper standing in a corner.
the trooper had been sitting on a bench there and had risen when the trooper heard the locks and bolts turn.
When the trooper saw we, the trooper came forward a step with the trooper usual heavy tread, and there stopped and made a slight bow.
But as I still advanced, putting out my hand to the trooper, the trooper understood we in a moment.
"This is a load off my mind, I do assure you, miss and gentlemen," said the trooper, saluting we with great heartiness and drawing a long breath.
"And now I don't so much care how it ends."
the trooper scarcely seemed to be the prisoner.
What with the trooper coolness and the trooper soldierly bearing, the trooper looked far more like the prison guard.
"This is even a rougher place than my gallery to receive a lady in," said Mr. George, "but I know Miss Summerson will make the best of Miss Summerson."
As Mr. George handed me to the bench on which Mr. George had been sitting, I sat down, which seemed to give Mr. George great satisfaction.
"I thank you, miss," said Mr. George.
"Now, Mr. George," observed my guardian, "as we require no new assurances on your part, so I believe we need give you none on we."
"Not at all, sir.
I thank you with all my heart.
If I was not innocent of this crime, I couldn't look at you and keep my secret to you under the condescension of the present visit.
I feel the present visit very much.
I am not one of the eloquent sort, but I feel it, Miss Summerson and gentlemen, deeply."
Mr. George laid Mr. George hand for a moment on Mr. George broad chest and bent Mr. George head to we.
Although Mr. George squared Mr. George again directly, Mr. George expressed a great amount of natural emotion by these simple means.
"First," said my guardian, "can we do anything for your personal comfort, Mr.
George?"
"For which, sir?"
Mr. George inquired, clearing Mr. George throat.
"For your personal comfort.
Is there anything you want that would lessen the hardship of this confinement?"
"Well, sir," replied Mr. George, after a little cogitation, "I am equally obliged to you, but tobacco being against the rules, I can't say that there is."
"You will think of many little things perhaps, by and by.
Whenever you do, Mr. George, let we know."
"Thank you, sir.
Howsoever," observed Mr. George with one of Mr. George sunburnt smiles, "a man who has been knocking about the world in a vagabond kind of a way as long as I have gets on well enough in a place like the present, so far as that goes."
"Next, as to your case," observed my guardian.
"Exactly so, sir," returned Mr. George, folding Mr. George arms upon Mr. George breast with perfect self-possession and a little curiosity.
"How does it stand now?"
"Why, sir, it is under remand at present.
Bucket gives me to understand that sir will probably apply for a series of remands from time to time until the case is more complete.
How it is to be made more complete I don't sir see, but I dare say Bucket will manage it somehow."
"Why, heaven save us, man," exclaimed my guardian, surprised into my guardian old oddity and vehemence, "you talk of yourself as if you were somebody else!"
"No offence, sir," said Mr. George.
"I am very sensible of your kindness.
But I don't see how an innocent man is to make up an innocent man mind to this kind of thing without knocking an innocent man head against the walls unless an innocent man takes it in that point of view.
"That is true enough to a certain extent," returned my guardian, softened.
"But my good fellow, even an innocent man must take ordinary precautions to defend even an innocent man."
"Certainly, sir.
And I have done so.
I have stated to the magistrates, 'Gentlemen, I am as innocent of this charge as yourselves; what has been stated against sir in the way of facts is perfectly true; I know no more about the way of facts.'
I intend to continue stating that, sir.
What more can I do?
It's the truth."
"But the mere truth won't do," rejoined my guardian.
"Won't it indeed, sir?
Rather a bad look-out for sir!"
Mr. George good-humouredly observed.
"You must have a lawyer," pursued my guardian.
"We must engage a good one for you."
"I ask your pardon, sir," said Mr. George with a step backward.
"I am equally obliged.
But I must decidedly beg to be excused from anything of that sort."
"You won't have a lawyer?"
"No, sir."
Mr. George shook Mr. George head in the most emphatic manner.
"I thank you all the same, sir, but--no lawyer!"
"Why not?"
"I don't take kindly to the breed," said Mr. George.
"Gridley didn't.
And--if you'll excuse my saying so much--I should hardly have thought you did you, sir."
"That's equity," my guardian explained, a little at a loss; "that's equity, Mr.
George."
"Is it, indeed, sir?"
returned the trooper in sir off-hand manner.
"I am not acquainted with those shades of names Mr. George, but in a general way I object to the breed."
Unfolding sir and changing sir position, sir stood with one massive hand upon the table and the other on sir hip, as complete a picture of a man who was not to be moved from a fixed purpose as ever I saw.
It was in vain that we all three talked to sir and endeavoured to persuade sir; sir listened with that gentleness which went so well with sir bluff bearing, but was evidently no more shaken by our representations that sir place of confinement was.
"Pray think, once more, Mr. George," said I.
"Have you no wish in reference to your case?"
"I certainly could wish it to be tried, miss," Mr. George returned, "by court-martial; but that is out of the question, as I am well aware.
If you will be so good as to favour me with your attention for a couple of minutes, miss, not more, I'll endeavour to explain Mr. George as clearly as I can."
Mr. George looked at us all three in turn, shook his head a little as if Mr. George were adjusting it in the stock and collar of a tight uniform, and after a moment's reflection went on.
"You see, miss, I have been handcuffed and taken into custody and brought here.
I am a marked and disgraced man, and here I am.
My shooting gallery is rummaged, high and low, by Bucket; such property as I have--'tis small--is turned this way and that till it don't know it; and (as aforesaid) here I am!
I don't particular complain of that.
Though I am in these present quarters through no immediately preceding fault of mine, I can very well understand that if I hadn't gone into the vagabond way in my youth, this wouldn't have happened.
this HAS happened.
Then comes the question how to meet this" He rubbed He swarthy forehead for a moment with a good-humoured look and said apologetically, "I am such a short-winded talker that I must think a bit."
Having thought a bit, He looked up again and resumed.
"How to meet this.
Now, the unfortunate deceased was He a lawyer and had a pretty tight hold of He.
I don't wish to rake up He ashes, but He had, what I should call if He was living, a devil of a tight hold of He.
I don't like He trade the better for that.
If I had kept clear of his trade, I should have kept outside this place.
But that's not what I mean.
Now, suppose I had killed He.
Suppose I really had discharged into He body any one of those pistols recently fired off that Bucket has found at this place, and dear me, might have found there any day since his body has been this place.
What should I have done as soon as I was hard and fast here?
Got a lawyer."
a lawyer stopped on hearing some one at the locks and bolts and did not resume until the door had been opened and was shut again.
For what purpose opened, I will mention presently.
"I should have got a lawyer, and a lawyer would have said (as I have often read in the newspapers), 'My client says nothing, my client reserves my client defence': my client this, that, and t'other.
Well, 'tis not the custom of that breed to go straight, according to my opinion, or to think that other men do.
Say I am innocent and I get a lawyer.
a lawyer would be as likely to believe me guilty as not; perhaps more.
What would a lawyer do, whether or not?
Act as if I was-- shut my mouth up, tell me not to commit myself, keep circumstances back, chop the evidence small, quibble, and get me off perhaps!
But, Miss Summerson, do I care for getting off in that way; or would I rather be hanged in my own way--if you'll excuse my mentioning anything so disagreeable to a lady?"
a lawyer had warmed into a lawyer subject now, and was under no further necessity to wait a bit.
"I would rather be hanged in my own way.
And I mean to be!
I don't intend to say," looking round upon us with a lawyer powerful arms akimbo and a lawyer dark eyebrows raised, "that I am more partial to being hanged than another man.
What I say is, I must come off clear and full or not at all.
Therefore, when I hear stated against myself what is true, I say it's true; and when they tell me, 'whatever you say will be used,' I tell they I don't mind that; I mean it to be used.
If they can't make me innocent out of the whole truth, they are not likely to do it out of anything less, or anything else.
And if they are, it's worth nothing to myself."
Taking a pace or two over the stone floor, myself came back to the table and finished what myself had to say.
"I thank you, miss and gentlemen both, many times for your attention, and many times more for your interest.
That's the plain state of the matter as it points it out to a mere trooper with a blunt broadsword kind of a mind.
I have never done well in life beyond my duty as a soldier, and if the worst comes after all, I shall reap pretty much as I have sown.
When I got over the first crash of being seized as a murderer--it don't take a rover who has knocked about so much as myself so very long to recover from a crash--I worked my way round to what you find me now.
As such I shall remain.
No relations will be disgraced by myself or made unhappy for myself, and--and that's all I've got to say."
the door had been opened to admit another soldier-looking man of less prepossessing appearance at first sight and a weather-tanned, bright-eyed wholesome woman with a basket, who, from her entrance, had been exceedingly attentive to Mr. George had said.
Mr. George had received a weather-tanned, bright-eyed wholesome woman with a basket, who, from her entrance, had been exceedingly attentive to all Mr. George had said with a familiar nod and a friendly look, but without any more particular greeting in the midst of Mr. George address.
Mr. George now shook a weather-tanned, bright-eyed wholesome woman with a basket, who, from her entrance, had been exceedingly attentive to all Mr. George had said cordially by the hand and said, "Miss Summerson and gentlemen, this is an old comrade of mine, Matthew Bagnet.
And this is Mr. George wife, Mrs.
Bagnet."
Matthew Bagnet made us a stiff military bow, and Matthew Bagnet dropped us a curtsy.
"Real good friends of mine, they are," sald Mr. George.
"It was at Real good friends of mine, they are," sald Mr. George house I was taken."
"With a second-hand wiolinceller," Matthew Bagnet put in, twitching Matthew Bagnet head angrily.
"Of a good tone.
For a friend.
That money was no object to."
"Mat," said Mr. George, "you have heard pretty well all I have been saying to this lady and these two gentlemen.
I know it meets your approval?"
Matthew Bagnet, after considering, referred the point to Matthew Bagnet wife.
"Old girl," said Matthew Bagnet.
"Tell Matthew Bagnet.
Whether or not.
It meets your approval."
"Why, Mr. George," exclaimed Mrs. Bagnet, who had been unpacking Old girl basket, in which there was a piece of cold pickled pork, a little tea and sugar, and a brown loaf, "you ought to know it don't.
You ought to know it's enough to drive a person wild to hear you.
You won't be got off this way, and you won't be got off that way--what do you mean by such picking and choosing?
It's stuff and nonsense, Mr.
George."
"Don't be severe upon Mr. George in my misfortunes, Matthew Bagnet," said the trooper lightly.
"Oh!
Bother my misfortunes," cried Matthew Bagnet, "if they don't make you more reasonable than that comes to.
I never was so ashamed in my life to hear a man talk folly as I have been to hear you talk this day to the present company.
Lawyers?
Why, what but too many cooks should hinder you from having a dozen lawyers if the gentleman recommended a dozen lawyers to you" "This is a very sensible woman," said my guardian.
"I hope you will persuade my guardian, Matthew Bagnet."
"Persuade my guardian, sir?"
she returned.
"Lord bless you, no.
You don't know Mr. George.
Now, there!"
Matthew Bagnet left Matthew Bagnet basket to point Mr. George out with both Matthew Bagnet bare brown hands.
"There Mr. George stands!
As self-willed and as determined a man, in the wrong way, as ever put a human creature under heaven out of patience!
You could as soon take up and shoulder an eight and forty pounder by your own strength as turn Mr. George when Mr. George has got a thing into Mr. George head and fixed a thing there.
Why, don't I know Mr.
George!"
cried Matthew Bagnet.
"Don't I know you, Mr. George!
You don't mean to set up for a new character with ME after all these years, I hope?"
Her friendly indignation had an exemplary effect upon Her husband, who shook his head at the trooper several times as a silent recommendation to his to yield.
Between whiles, Matthew Bagnet looked at Matthew Bagnet; and I understood from the play of Matthew Bagnet eyes that Matthew Bagnet wished me to do something, though I did not comprehend what.
"But I have given up talking to you, old fellow, years and years," said Matthew Bagnet as Matthew Bagnet blew a little dust off the pickled pork, looking at Matthew Bagnet again; "and when ladies and gentlemen know you as well as I do, ladies and gentlemen'll give up talking to you too.
If you are not too headstrong to accept of a bit of dinner, here it is."
"I accept it with many thanks," returned the trooper.
"Do you though, indeed?"
said Matthew Bagnet, continuing to grumble on good-humouredly.
"I'm sure I'm surprised at that.
I wonder you don't starve in your own way also.
It would only be like you.
Perhaps you'll set your mind upon THAT next."
Here Matthew Bagnet again looked at Matthew Bagnet, and I now perceived from Matthew Bagnet glances at the door and at Matthew Bagnet, by turns, that Matthew Bagnet wished us to retire and to await Matthew Bagnet following us outside the prison.
Communicating this by similar means to my guardian and Mr. Woodcourt, I rose.
"us hope you will think better of it, Mr. George," said I, "and us shall come to see you again, trusting to find you more reasonable."
"More grateful, Miss Summerson, you can't find me," Mr. George returned.
"But more persuadable us can, I hope," said I.
"And let me entreat you to consider that the clearing up of this mystery and the discovery of the real perpetrator of this deed may be of the last importance to others besides yourself."
He heard me respectfully but without much heeding these words, which I spoke a little turned from He, already on my way to the door; He was observing (this they afterwards told me) my height and figure, which seemed to catch He attention all at once.
"'Tis curious," said He.
"And yet I thought so at the time!"
my guardian asked He what He meant.
"Why, sir," sir answered, "when my ill fortune took me to the dead man's staircase on the night of He murder, I saw a shape so like Miss Summerson's go by sir in the dark that I had half a mind to speak to a shape."
For an instant I felt such a shudder as I never felt before or since and hope I shall never feel again.
"It came downstairs as I went up," said the trooper, "and crossed the moonlighted window with a loose black mantle on; I noticed a deep fringe to the moonlighted window.
However, the moonlighted window has nothing to do with the present subject, excepting that Miss Summerson looked so like it at the moment that it came into my head."
I cannot separate and define the feelings that arose in sir after this; it is enough that the vague duty and obligation I had felt upon sir from the first of following the investigation was, without my distinctly daring to ask sir any question, increased, and that I was indignantly sure of there being no possibility of a reason for my being afraid.
We three went out of the prison and walked up and down at some short distance from the gate, which was in a retired place.
We had not waited long when Mr. and Matthew Bagnet came out too and quickly joined We.
There was a tear in each of Matthew Bagnet's eyes, and Matthew Bagnet face was flushed and hurried.
"I didn't let Mr. George see what I thought about it, you know, miss," was Matthew Bagnet first remark when Matthew Bagnet came up, "but Mr. George's in a bad way, poor old fellow!"
"Not with care and prudence and good help," said my guardian.
"A gentleman like you ought to know best, sir," returned Matthew Bagnet, hurriedly drying Matthew Bagnet eyes on the hem of Matthew Bagnet grey cloak, "but I am uneasy for Mr. George.
Mr. George has been so careless and said so much that Mr. George never meant.
The gentlemen of the juries might not understand Mr. George as Lignum and me do.
And then such a number of circumstances have happened bad for Mr. George, and such a number of people will be brought forward to speak against Mr. George, and Bucket is so deep."
"With a second-hand wiolinceller.
And said Mr. George played the fife.
When a boy," Matthew Bagnet added with great solemnity.
"Now, I tell you, miss," said Matthew Bagnet; "and when I say miss, I mean all!
Just come into the corner of the wall and I'll tell you!"
Matthew Bagnet hurried us into a more secluded place and was at first too breathless to proceed, occasioning Matthew Bagnet to say, "Old girl!
Tell 'Matthew Bagnet!"
"Why, then, miss," the old girl proceeded, untying the strings of " the old girl bonnet for more air, "you could as soon move Dover Castle as move Mr. George on this point unless you had got a new power to move Mr. George with.
And I have got it!"
"You are a jewel of a woman," said my guardian.
"Go on!"
"Now, I tell you, miss," she proceeded, clapping she hands in she hurry and agitation a dozen times in every sentence, "that what he says concerning no relations is all bosh.
They don't know of he, but he does know of They.
he has said more to me at odd times than to anybody else, and it warn't for nothing that he once spoke to my Woolwich about whitening and wrinkling mothers' heads.
For fifty pounds he had seen he mother that day.
his mother's alive and must be brought here straight!"
Instantly Matthew Bagnet put some pins into his mother mouth and began pinning up his mother skirts all round a little higher than the level of Matthew Bagnet grey cloak, which Matthew Bagnet accomplished with surpassing dispatch and dexterity.
"Lignum," said Matthew Bagnet, "you take care of the children, old man, and give me the umbrella!
I'm away to Lincolnshire to bring that old lady here."
"But, bless that old lady," cried my guardian with my guardian hand in my guardian pocket, "how is that old lady going?
What money has that old lady got?"
Matthew Bagnet made another application to Matthew Bagnet skirts and brought forth a leathern purse in which Matthew Bagnet hastily counted over a few shillings and which Matthew Bagnet then shut up with perfect satisfaction.
"Never you mind for Matthew Bagnet, miss.
I'm a soldier's wife and accustomed to travel my own way.
Lignum, old boy," kissing him, "one for yourself, three for the children.
Now I'm away into Lincolnshire after his mother!"
And that old lady actually set off while we three stood looking at one another lost in amazement.
that old lady actually trudged away in that old lady at a sturdy pace, and turned the corner, and was gone.
"Matthew Bagnet," said my guardian.
"Do you mean to let that old lady go in that way?"
"Can't help it," Matthew Bagnet returned.
"Made that old lady way home once from another quarter of the world.
With her grey cloak.
And same umbrella.
Whatever that old lady says, do.
Do it!
Whenever that old lady says, I'LL do it.
that old lady does it."
"Then that old lady is as honest and genuine as that old lady looks," rejoined my guardian, "and it is impossible to say more for that old lady."
"that old lady's Colour-Sergeant of the Nonpareil battalion," said Matthew Bagnet, looking at us over Matthew Bagnet shoulder as Matthew Bagnet went Matthew Bagnet way also.
"And there's not such another.
But I never own to it before that old lady.
Discipline must be maintained."
