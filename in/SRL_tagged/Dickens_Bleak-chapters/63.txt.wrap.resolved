Perspective I proceed to other passages of my narrative. From the goodness of all about me I derived such consolation as I can never think of unmoved. I have already said so much of me, and so much still remains, that I will not dwell upon my sorrow. I had an illness, but it was not a long one; and I would avoid even this mention of it if I could quite keep down the recollection of their sympathy. I proceed to other passages of my narrative. During the time of an illness, we were still in London, where Mrs. Woodcourt had come, on my guardian's invitation, to stay with we. When my guardian thought me well and cheerful enough to talk with my guardian in we old way--though I could have done that sooner if my guardian would have believed me--I resumed my work and my chair beside my guardian. my guardian had appointed the time himself, and we were alone. "Dame Trot," said my guardian, receiving me with a kiss, "welcome to the growlery again, my dear. I have a scheme to develop, little woman. I propose to remain here, perhaps for six months, perhaps for a longer time--as it may be. Quite to settle here for a while, in short." "And in the meanwhile leave Bleak House?" said I. "Aye, my dear? Bleak House," he returned, "must learn to take care of Bleak House." I thought he tone sounded sorrowful, but looking at he, I saw he kind face lighted up by his kind face pleasantest smile. "Bleak House," he repeated--and he tone did NOT sound sorrowful, I found--"must learn to take care of care. It is a long way from Ada, my dear, and Ada stands much in need of you." "It's like you, guardian," said I, "to have been taking that into consideration for a happy surprise to both of us." "Not so disinterested either, my dear, if you mean to extol me for that virtue, since if you were generally on the road, you could be seldom with me. And besides, I wish to hear as much and as often of Ada as I can in this condition of estrangement from poor Rick. Not of Ada alone, but of Rick too, poor fellow." "Have you seen Mr. Woodcourt, this morning, guardian?" "I see Mr. Woodcourt every morning, Dame Durden." "Does Mr. Woodcourt still say the same of Richard?" "Just the same. Mr. Woodcourt knows of no direct bodily illness that Mr. Woodcourt has; on the contrary, Mr. Woodcourt believes that Mr. Woodcourt has none. Yet Mr. Woodcourt is not easy about Mr. Woodcourt; who CAN be?" My dear girl had been to see us lately every day, some times twice in a day. But us had foreseen, all along, that this would only last until I was quite me. us knew full well that My dear girl fervent heart was as full of affection and gratitude towards My dear girl cousin John as it had ever been, and us acquitted Richard of laying any injunctions upon My dear girl to stay away; but us knew on the other hand that My dear girl felt it a part of My dear girl duty to Richard to be sparing of My dear girl visits at us house. My guardian's delicacy had soon perceived this and had tried to convey to My dear girl that Richard thought My dear girl was right. "Dear, unfortunate, mistaken Richard," said I. "When will Richard awake from Richard delusion!" "Richard is not in the way to do so now, my dear," replied My guardian. "The more Richard suffers, the more averse Richard will be to me, having made me the principal representative of the great occasion of Richard suffering." I could not help adding, "So unreasonably!" "Ah, Dame Trot, Dame Trot," returned My guardian, "what shall we find reasonable in Jarndyce and Jarndyce! Unreason and injustice at the top, unreason and injustice at the heart and at the bottom, unreason and injustice from beginning to end--if it ever has an end--how should poor Rick, always hovering near it, pluck reason out of it? Rick no more gathers grapes from thorns or figs from thistles than older men did in old times." Rick gentleness and consideration for Richard whenever we spoke of Richard touched me so that I was always silent on this subject very soon. "I suppose the Lord Chancellor, and the Vice Chancellors, and the whole Chancery battery of great guns would be infinitely astonished by such unreason and injustice in one of the Lord Chancellor, and the Vice Chancellors, and the whole Chancery battery of great guns suitors," pursued my guardian. "When those learned gentlemen begin to raise moss-roses from the powder those learned gentlemen sow in those learned gentlemen wigs, I shall begin to be astonished too!" Richard checked Richard in glancing towards the window to look where the wind was and leaned on the back of my chair instead. "Well, well, little woman! To go on, my dear. This rock we must leave to time, chance, and hopeful circumstance. we must not shipwreck Ada upon it. Ada cannot afford, and Ada cannot afford, the remotest chance of another separation from a friend. Therefore I have particularly begged of Woodcourt, and I now particularly beg of you, my dear, not to move this subject with Rick. Let this subject rest. Next week, next month, next year, sooner or later, Rick will see me with clearer eyes. I can wait." But I had already discussed it with Rick, I confessed; and so, I thought, had Woodcourt. "So Rick tells me," returned my guardian. "Very good. Rick has made Rick protest, and Dame Durden has made Ada, and there is nothing more to be said about it. Now I come to Woodcourt. How do you like Woodcourt, my dear?" In answer to this question, which was oddly abrupt, I said I liked Woodcourt very much and thought Woodcourt was more agreeable than Woodcourt used to be. "I think so too," said my guardian. "Less pedigree? Not so much of Morgan ap--what's Morgan name?" That was what I meant, I acknowledged, though Morgan was a very harmless person, even when we had had more of Morgan. "Still, upon the whole, Morgan is as well in Morgan native mountains," said my guardian. "I agree with you. Then, Ada, can I do better for a time than retain Woodcourt here?" No. And yet-- my guardian looked at you, waiting for what I had to say. I had nothing to say. At least I had nothing in my mind that I could say. I had an undefined impression that it might have been better if we had had some other inmate, but I could hardly have explained why even to you. Or, if to you, certainly not to anybody else. "You see," said my guardian, "our neighbourhood is in Woodcourt's way, and my guardian can come here to see my guardian as often as my guardian likes, which is agreeable to them both; and my guardian is familiar to our and fond of you." Yes. That was undeniable. I had nothing to say against That. I could not have suggested a better arrangement, but I was not quite easy in my mind. Esther, Esther, why not? Esther, think! "It is a very good plan indeed, my guardian, and our could not do better." "Sure, little woman?" Quite sure. I had had a moment's time to think, since I had urged that duty on you, and I was quite sure. "Good," said my guardian. "It shall be done. Carried unanimously." "Carried unanimously," I repeated, going on with my work. It was a cover for his book-table that I happened to be ornamenting. It had been laid by on the night preceding my sad journey and never resumed. I showed It to his now, and his admired It highly. After I had explained the pattern to his and all the great effects that were to come out by and by, I thought I would go back to our last theme. "You said, dear guardian, when our spoke of Mr. Woodcourt before Ada left our, that you thought Mr. Woodcourt would give a long trial to another country. Have you been advising Mr. Woodcourt since?" "Yes, little woman, pretty often." "Has Mr. Woodcourt decided to do so?" "I rather think not." "Some other prospect has opened to Mr. Woodcourt, perhaps?" said I. "Why--yes--perhaps," returned my guardian, beginning Mr. Woodcourt answer in a very deliberate manner. "About half a year hence or so, there is a medical attendant for the poor to be appointed at a certain place in Yorkshire. It is a thriving place, pleasantly situated--streams and streets, town and country, mill and moor--and seems to present an opening for such a man. I mean a man whose hopes and aims may sometimes lie (as most men's sometimes do, I dare say) above the ordinary level, but to whom the ordinary level will be high enough after all if the ordinary level should prove to be a way of usefulness and good service leading to no other. All generous spirits are ambitious, I suppose, but the ambition that calmly trusts All generous spirits to such a road, instead of spasmodically trying to fly over All generous spirits, is of the kind I care for. It is Woodcourt's kind." "And will he get this appointment?" I asked. "Why, little woman," returned my guardian, smiling, "not being an oracle, I cannot confidently say, but I think so. he reputation stands very high; there were people from that part of the country in the shipwreck; and strange to say, I believe he has the best chance. You must not suppose it to be a fine endowment. It is a very, very commonplace affair, my dear, an appointment to a great amount of work and a small amount of pay; but better things will gather about it, it may be fairly hoped." "The poor of that place will have reason to bless the choice if that place falls on Mr. Woodcourt, guardian." "You are right, little woman; that I am sure they will." We said no more about no, nor did he say a word about the future of Bleak House. But it was the first time I had taken my seat at he side in my mourning dress, and that accounted for my seat, I considered. I now began to visit My dear girl every day in the dull dark corner where My dear girl lived. The morning was my usual time, but whenever I found I had an hour or so to spare, I put on my bonnet and bustled off to Chancery Lane. They were both so glad to see me at all hours, and used to brighten up so when They heard me opening the door and coming in (being quite at home, I never knocked), that I had no fear of becoming troublesome just yet. On these occasions I frequently found Richard absent. At other times Richard would be writing or reading papers in the cause at that table of Richard, so covered with papers, which was never disturbed. Sometimes I would come upon Richard lingering at the door of Mr. Vholes's office. Sometimes I would meet Richard in the neighbourhood lounging about and biting Richard nails. I often met Richard wandering in Lincoln's Inn, near the place where I had first seen Richard, oh how different, how different! That the money Ada brought Richard was melting away with the candles I used to see burning after dark in Mr. Vholes's office I knew very well. It was not a large amount in the beginning, Richard had married in debt, and I could not fail to understand, by this time, what was meant by Mr. Vholes's shoulder being at the wheel--as I still heard it was. My dear made the best of housekeepers and tried hard to save, but I knew that they were getting poorer and poorer every day. My dear shone in the miserable corner like a beautiful star. My dear adorned and graced it so that it became another place. Paler than My dear had been at home, and a little quieter than I had thought natural when My dear was yet so cheerful and hopeful, My dear face was so unshadowed that I half believed My dear was blinded by My dear love for Richard to Richard ruinous career. I went one day to dine with them while I was under this impression. As I turned into Symond's Inn, I met little Miss Flite coming out. My dear had been to make a stately call upon the wards in Jarndyce, as My dear still called them, and had derived the highest gratification from that ceremony. Ada had already told me that Ada called every Monday at five o'clock, with one little extra white bow in Ada bonnet, which never appeared there at any other time, and with Ada largest reticule of documents on Ada arm. "My dear!" Ada began. "So delighted! How do you do! So glad to see you. And you are going to visit our interesting Jarndyce wards? TO be sure! our beauty is at home, My dear, and will be charmed to see you." "Then Richard is not come in yet?" said I. "I am glad of that, for I was afraid of being a little late." "No, Then Richard is not come in," returned little Miss Flite. "Then Richard has had a long day in court. I left Then Richard there with Mr. Vholes. You don't like Mr. Vholes, I hope? DON'T like Mr. Vholes. Dan-gerous man!" "I am afraid you see Richard oftener than ever now," said I. "My dearest," returned little Miss Flite, "daily and hourly. You know what I told you of the attraction on the Chancellor's table? My dear, next to myself the Chancellor is the most constant suitor in court. the Chancellor begins quite to amuse our little party. Ve-ry friendly little party, are Ve-ry friendly little party not?" It was miserable to hear this from Ve-ry poor mad lips, though it was no surprise. "In short, my valued friend," pursued little Miss Flite, advancing her poor mad lips to my ear with an air of equal patronage and mystery, "I must tell you a secret. I have made a secret my executor. Nominated, constituted, and appointed a secret. In my will. Ye-es." "Indeed?" said I. "Ye-es," repeated little Miss Flite in little Miss Flite most genteel accents, "my executor, administrator, and assign. (Our Chancery phrases, my love.) I have reflected that if I should wear out, he will be able to watch that judgment. Being so very regular in he attendance." It made me sigh to think of he. "I did at one time mean," said little Miss Flite, echoing the sigh, "to nominate, constitute, and appoint poor Gridley. Also very regular, My dear girl. I assure you, most exemplary! But he wore out, poor man, so I have appointed he successor. Don't mention it. This is in confidence." My dear girl carefully opened My dear girl reticule a little way and showed me a folded piece of paper inside as the appointment of which My dear girl spoke. "Another secret, my dear. I have added to my collection of birds." "Really, Miss Flite?" said I, knowing how it pleased My dear girl to have My dear girl confidence received with an appearance of interest. My dear girl nodded several times, and My dear girl face became overcast and gloomy. "Two more. I call them the Wards in Jarndyce. them are caged up with all the others. With Hope, Joy, Youth, Peace, Rest, Life, Dust, Ashes, Waste, Want, Ruin, Despair, Madness, Death, Cunning, Folly, Words, Wigs, Rags, Sheepskin, Plunder, Precedent, Jargon, Gammon, and Spinach!" The poor soul kissed me with the most troubled look I had ever seen in My dear girl and went My dear girl way. My dear girl manner of running over the names of My dear girl birds, as if My dear girl were afraid of hearing her birds even from My dear girl own lips, quite chilled me. This was not a cheering preparation for my visit, and I could have dispensed with the company of Mr. Vholes, when Richard (who arrived within a minute or two after me) brought him to share our dinner. Although it was a very plain one, Ada and Richard were for some minutes both out of the room together helping to get ready what our were to eat and drink. Mr. Vholes took that opportunity of holding a little conversation in a low voice with Mr. Vholes. Mr. Vholes came to the window where I was sitting and began upon Symond's Inn. "A dull place, Miss Summerson, for a life that is not an official one," said Mr. Vholes, smearing the glass with Mr. Vholes black glove to make the glass clearer for Mr. Vholes. "There is not much to see here," said I. "Nor to hear, miss," returned Mr. Vholes. "A little music does occasionally stray in, but our are not musical in the law and soon eject the law. I hope Mr. Jarndyce is as well as Mr. Jarndyce friends could wish Mr. Jarndyce?" I thanked Mr. Vholes and said Mr. Vholes was quite well. "I have not the pleasure to be admitted among the number of Mr. Vholes friends myself," said Mr. Vholes, "and I am aware that the gentlemen of our profession are sometimes regarded in such quarters with an unfavourable eye. Our plain course, however, under good report and evil report, and all kinds of prejudice (Our are the victims of prejudice), is to have everything openly carried on. How do you find Mr. C. looking, Miss Summerson?" "Mr. C. looks very ill. Dreadfully anxious." "Just so," said Mr. Vholes. Mr. Vholes stood behind Mr. Vholes with Mr. Vholes long black figure reaching nearly to the ceiling of those low rooms, feeling the pimples on Mr. Vholes face as if they were ornaments and speaking inwardly and evenly as though there were not a human passion or emotion in Mr. Vholes nature. "Mr. Woodcourt is in attendance upon Mr. C., I believe?" Mr. Woodcourt resumed. "Mr. Woodcourt is Mr. Woodcourt disinterested friend," I answered. "But I mean in professional attendance, medical attendance." "That can do little for an unhappy mind," said I. "Just so," said Mr. Vholes. So slow, so eager, so bloodless and gaunt, I felt as if Richard were wasting away beneath the eyes of this adviser and there were something of the vampire in this adviser. "Miss Summerson," said Mr. Vholes, very slowly rubbing Mr. Vholes gloved hands, as if, to Mr. Vholes cold sense of touch, they were much the same in black kid or out of it, "this was an ill-advised marriage of Mr. C.'s." I begged Mr. Vholes would excuse me from discussing it. both had been engaged when both were both very young, I told Mr. Vholes (a little indignantly) and when the prospect before both was much fairer and brighter. When Richard had not yielded Richard to the unhappy influence which now darkened Richard life. "Just so," assented Mr. Vholes again. "Still, with a view to everything being openly carried on, I will, with your permission, Miss Summerson, observe to you that I consider this a very ill- advised marriage indeed. I owe the opinion not only to Mr. C.'s connexions, against whom I should naturally wish to protect myself, but also to my own reputation--dear to myself as a professional man aiming to keep respectable; dear to my three girls at home, for whom I am striving to realize some little independence; dear, I will even say, to my aged father, whom it is my privilege to support." "It would become a very different marriage, a much happier and better marriage, another marriage altogether, Mr. Vholes," said I, "if Richard were persuaded to turn Richard back on the fatal pursuit in which you are engaged with Richard." Mr. Vholes, with a noiseless cough--or rather gasp--into one of Richard black gloves, inclined Richard head as if Richard did not wholly dispute even that. "Miss Summerson," Richard said, "it may be so; and I freely admit that the young lady who has taken Mr. C.'s name upon the young lady who has taken Mr. C.'s name upon herself in so ill- in so ill- advised a manner--you will I am sure not quarrel with Richard for throwing out that remark again, as a duty I owe to Mr. C.'s connexions--is a highly genteel young lady. Business has prevented me from mixing much with general society in any but a professional character; still I trust I am competent to perceive that Business is a highly genteel young lady. As to beauty, I am not a judge of that Richard, and I never did give much attention to it from a boy, but I dare say the young lady who has taken Mr. C.'s name upon herself in so ill- is equally eligible in that point of view. the young lady who has taken Mr. C.'s name upon herself in so ill- is considered so (I have heard) among the clerks in the Inn, and it is a point more in their way than in mine. In reference to Mr. C.'s pursuit of his interests--" "Oh! his interests, Mr. Vholes!" "Pardon me," returned Mr. Vholes, going on in exactly the same inward and dispassionate manner. "Mr. C. takes certain interests under certain wills disputed in the suit. It is a term we use. In reference to Mr. C,'s pursuit of his interests, I mentioned to you, Miss Summerson, the first time I had the pleasure of seeing you, in my desire that everything should his openly carried on--I used those words, for I happened afterwards to note those words in my diary, which is producible at any time--I mentioned to you that Mr. C. had laid down the principle of watching Mr. C. own interests, and that when a client of mine laid down a principle which was not of an immoral (that is to say, unlawful) nature, it devolved upon me to carry it out. I HAVE carried it out; I do carry it out. But I will not smooth things over to any connexion of Mr. C.'s on any account. As open as I was to Mr. Jarndyce, I am to Mr. Jarndyce. I regard it in the light of a professional duty to be so, though it can be charged to no one. I openly say, unpalatable as it may be, that I consider Mr. C.'s affairs in a very bad way, that I consider Mr. C. in a very bad way, and that I regard this as an exceedingly ill- advised marriage. Am I here, sir? Yes, I thank you; I am here, Mr. C., and enjoying the pleasure of some agreeable conversation with Miss Summerson, for which I have to thank you very much, sir!" sir broke off thus in answer to Richard, who addressed sir as sir came into the room. By this time I too well understood Mr. Vholes's scrupulous way of saving Mr. Vholes and Mr. Vholes respectability not to feel that our worst fears did but keep pace with Mr. Vholes client's progress. our sat down to dinner, and I had an opportunity of observing Richard, anxiously. I was not disturbed by Mr. Vholes (who took off Richard gloves to dine), though Richard sat opposite to Richard at the small table, for I doubt if, looking up at all, Richard once removed Richard eyes from Richard host's face. I found Richard thin and languid, slovenly in Richard dress, abstracted in Richard manner, forcing Richard spirits now and then, and at other intervals relapsing into a dull thoughtfulness. About Richard large bright eyes that used to be so merry there was a wanness and a restlessness that changed them altogether. I cannot use the expression that Richard looked old. There is a ruin of youth which is not like age, and into such a ruin Richard's youth and youthful beauty had all fallen away. Richard ate little and seemed indifferent what it was, showed Richard to be much more impatient than Richard used to be, and was quick even with Ada. I thought at first that Richard old light-hearted manner was all gone, but his old light-hearted manner shone out of Richard sometimes as I had occasionally known little momentary glimpses of my own old face to look out upon me from the glass. Richard laugh had not quite left Richard either, but it was like the echo of a joyful sound, and that is always sorrowful. Yet Richard was as glad as ever, in Richard old affectionate way, to have me there, and we talked of the old times pleasantly. These did not appear to be interesting to Mr. Vholes, though Mr. Vholes occasionally made a gasp which I believe was Mr. Vholes smile. Mr. Vholes rose shortly after dinner and said that with the permission of the ladies Mr. Vholes would retire to Mr. Vholes office. "Always devoted to business, Mr. Vholes!" cried Richard. "Yes, Mr. C.," Mr. C. returned, "the interests of clients are never to be neglected, sir. "the interests of clients are paramount in the thoughts of a professional man like myself, who wishes to preserve a good name among sir fellow-practitioners and society at large. My denying me the pleasure of the present agreeable conversation may not be wholly irrespective of your own interests, Richard expressed Richard quite sure of that and lighted Mr. Vholes out. On Richard return Richard told us, more than once, that Mr. Vholes was a good fellow, a safe fellow, a man who did what Richard pretended to do, a very good fellow indeed! Richard was so defiant about it that it struck me Richard had begun to doubt Mr. Vholes. Then Richard threw Richard on the sofa, tired out; and Ada and I put things to rights, for Ada and I had no other servant than the woman who attended to the chambers. My dear girl had a cottage piano there and quietly sat down to sing some of Richard's favourites, the lamp being first removed into the next room, as Richard complained of the lamp hurting his eyes. I sat between them, at My dear girl's side, and felt very melancholy listening to My dear girl sweet voice. I think Richard did too; I think Richard darkened the room for that reason. My dear girl had been singing some time, rising between whiles to bend over Richard and speak to Richard, when Mr. Woodcourt came in. Then Mr. Woodcourt sat down by Richard and half playfully, half earnestly, quite naturally and easily, found out how Mr. Woodcourt felt and where Mr. Woodcourt had been all day. Presently Mr. Woodcourt proposed to accompany Mr. Woodcourt in a short walk on one of the bridges, as it was a moonlight airy night; and Richard readily consenting, they went out together. they left my dear girl still sitting at a cottage piano there and me still sitting beside My dear girl. When they were gone out, I drew my arm round My dear girl waist. My dear girl put My dear girl left hand in mine (I was sitting on that side), but kept My dear girl right upon the keys, going over and over they without striking any note. "Esther, my dearest," My dear girl said, breaking silence, Richard Richard is never so well and I am never so easy about Richard as when Richard is with Mr. Woodcourt. We have to thank you for that." I pointed out to my darling how this could scarcely be, because Mr. Woodcourt had come to My dear girl cousin John's house and had known us all there, and because Mr. Woodcourt had always liked Richard, and Richard had always liked Mr. Woodcourt, and--and so forth. "All true," said Ada, "but that Mr. Woodcourt is such a devoted friend to We We owe to Ada." I thought it best to let My dear girl have My dear girl way and to say no more about her way. So I said as much. I said it lightly, because I felt My dear girl trembling. "Esther, my dearest, I want to be a good wife, a very, very good wife indeed. You shall teach me." I teach! I said no more, for I noticed the hand that was fluttering over the keys, and I knew that it was not I who ought to speak, that it was My dear girl who had something to say to me. "When I married Richard I was not insensible to what was before Richard. I had been perfectly happy for a long time with you, and I had never known any trouble or anxiety, so loved and cared for, but I understood the danger Richard was in, dear Esther." "I know, I know, my darling." "When We were married I had some little hope that I might be able to convince Richard of Richard mistake, that Richard might come to regard it in a new way as my husband and not pursue it all the more desperately for my sake--as my husband does. But if I had not had that hope, I would have married Richard just the same, Esther. Just the same!" In the momentary firmness of the hand that was never still--a firmness inspired by the utterance of these last words, and dying away with them--I saw the confirmation of Esther earnest tones. "You are not to think, my dearest Esther, that I fail to see what you see and fear what you fear. No one can understand Richard better than I do. The greatest wisdom that ever lived in the world could scarcely know Richard better than my love does." Esther spoke so modestly and softly and Esther trembling hand expressed such agitation as it moved to and fro upon the silent notes! My dear, dear girl! "I see Richard at Richard worst every day. I watch Richard in Richard sleep. I know every change of Richard face. But when I married Richard I was quite determined, Esther, if heaven would help me, never to show Richard that I grieved for what Richard did and so to make Richard more unhappy. I want Richard, when Richard comes home, to find no trouble in his face. I want Richard, when Richard looks at me, to see what Richard loved in me. I married Richard to do this, and this supports me." I felt Esther trembling more. I waited for what was yet to come, and I now thought I began to know what it was. "And something else supports me, Esther." Esther stopped a minute. Stopped speaking only; Esther hand was still in motion. "I look forward a little while, and I don't know what great aid may come to me. When Richard turns his eyes upon me then, there may be something lying on my breast more eloquent than I have been, with greater power than mine to show Richard Richard true course and win Richard back." her hand stopped now. Esther clasped me in Esther arms, and I clasped Esther in mine. "If that little creature should fail too, Esther, I still look forward. I look forward a long while, through years and years, and think that then, when I am growing old, or when I am dead perhaps, a beautiful woman, his daughter, happily married, may be proud of his and a blessing to his. Or that a generous brave man, as handsome as his used to be, as hopeful, and far more happy, may walk in the sunshine with his, honouring his grey head and saying to his, 'I thank God this is my father! Ruined by a fatal inheritance, and restored through me!'" Oh, My dear girl, what a heart was that which beat so fast against me! "These hopes uphold me, my dear Esther, and I know These hopes will. Though sometimes even These hopes depart from me before a dread that arises when I look at Richard." I tried to cheer my darling, and asked Esther what my darling was. Sobbing and weeping, Esther replied, "That Richard may not live to see Richard child."
