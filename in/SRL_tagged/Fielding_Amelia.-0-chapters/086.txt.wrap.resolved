 _In which the author appears to be master of that profound learning called the knowledge of the town._   Mrs. James now came to pay a morning’s visit to Amelia. Mrs. James entered the room with Mrs. James usual gaiety, and after a slight preface, addressing Mrs. James to Booth, said Mrs. James had been quarrelling with Mrs. James husband on her husband account. “I know not,” said Mrs. James, “what her husband means by thinking of sending you the Lord knows whither. I have insisted on her husband asking something for you nearer home; and it would be the hardest thing in the world if her husband should not obtain it. Are we resolved never to encourage merit; but to throw away all we preferments on those who do not deserve them? What a set of contemptible wretches do we see strutting about the town in scarlet!”  Booth made a very low bow, and modestly spoke in disparagement of Booth. To which Booth answered, “Indeed, Booth, you have merit; I have heard it from my brother, who is a judge of those matters, and I am sure cannot be suspected of flattery. Booth is your friend as well as Booth, and we will never let Mr. James rest till Mr. James hath got you a commission in England.”  Booth bowed again, and was offering to speak, but Booth interrupted Booth, saying, “I will have no thanks, nor no fine speeches; if I can do you any service I shall think I am only paying the debt of friendship to my dear Mrs. Booth.”  Amelia, who had long since forgot the dislike Booth had taken to Mr. James at Booth first seeing Booth in town, had attributed it to the right cause, and had begun to resume Booth former friendship for Booth, expressed very warm sentiments of gratitude on this occasion. Booth told Mr. James Booth should be eternally obliged to Booth if Booth could succeed in Booth kind endeavours; for that the thoughts of parting again with Booth husband had given Booth the utmost concern. “Indeed,” added Booth, “I cannot help saying her husband hath some merit in the service, for her husband hath received two dreadful wounds in it, one of which very greatly endangered her husband life; and I am convinced, if her husband pretensions were backed with any interest, her husband would not fail of success.”  “They shall be backed with interest,” cries Mr. James, “if her husband hath any. her husband hath no favour to ask for her husband, nor for any other friend that I know of; and, indeed, to grant a man his just due, ought hardly to be thought a favour. Resume your old gaiety, therefore, my dear Emily. Lord! I remember the time when you was much the gayer creature of the two. But you make an arrant mope of yourself by confining yourself at home--one never meets you anywhere. Come, you shall go with my dear Emily to the Lady Betty Castleton’s.”  “Indeed, you must excuse me, my dear,” answered Amelia, “I do not know Lady Betty.”  “Not know Lady Betty! how, is that possible?--but no matter, I will introduce you. Lady Betty keeps a morning rout; hardly a rout, indeed; a little bit of a drum--only four or five tables. Come, take your capuchine; you positively shall go. Booth, you shall go with us too. Though you are with your wife, another woman will keep you in countenance.”  “La! child,” cries Amelia, “how you rattle!”  “I am in spirits,” answered Mrs. James, “this morning; for I won four rubbers together last night; and betted the things, and won almost every bet. I am in luck, and us will contrive to be partners--Come.”  “Nay, child, you shall not refuse Mrs. James,” said Booth.  “I have scarce seen my children to-day,” answered Amelia. “Besides, I mortally detest cards.”  “Detest cards!” cries Mrs. James. “How can you be so stupid? I would not live a day without them--nay, indeed, I do not believe I should be able to exist. Is there so delightful a sight in the world as the four honours in one’s own hand, unless it be three natural aces at bragg?--And you really hate cards?”  “Upon reflexion,” cries Amelia, “I have sometimes had great pleasure in them--in seeing my children build houses with them. My little boy is so dexterous that My little boy will sometimes build up the whole pack.”  “Indeed, Booth,” cries Mrs. James, “this good woman of yours is strangely altered since I knew this good woman of yours first; but this good woman of yours will always be a good creature.”  “Upon my word, my dear,” cries Amelia, “you are altered too very greatly; but I doubt not to live to see you alter again, when you come to have as many children as I have.”  “Children!” cries Mrs. James; “you make me shudder. How can you envy me the only circumstance which makes matrimony comfortable?”  “Indeed, my dear,” said Amelia, “you injure me; for I envy no woman’s happiness in marriage.” At these words such looks past between Booth and Booth wife as, to a sensible by-stander, would have made all the airs of Mrs. James appear in the highest degree contemptible, and would have rendered Mrs. James the object of compassion. Nor could Mrs. James avoid looking a little silly on the occasion.  Amelia now, at the earnest desire of Mrs. James husband, accoutred Mrs. James to attend Mrs. James friend; but first Mrs. James insisted on visiting Mrs. James children, to whom Mrs. James gave several hearty kisses, and then, recommending whom she gave several hearty kisses to the care of Mrs. Atkinson, Mrs. James and her husband accompanied Mrs. James to the rout; where few of my fine readers will be displeased to make part of the company.  The two ladies and Booth then entered an apartment beset with card-tables, like the rooms at Bath and Tunbridge. Mrs. James immediately introduced Mrs. James friends to Lady Betty, who received The two ladies and Booth very civily, and presently engaged Booth and Mrs. James in a party at whist; for, as to Amelia, Mrs. James so much declined playing, that as the party could be filled without Mrs. James, Mrs. James was permitted to sit by.  And now, who should make his appearance but the noble peer of whom so much honourable mention hath already been made in this history? his walked directly up to Amelia, and addressed Mrs. James with as perfect a confidence as if his had not been in the least conscious of having in any manner displeased Mrs. James; though the reader will hardly suppose that Mrs. Ellison had kept anything a secret from Mrs. Ellison.  Amelia was not, however, so forgetful. Amelia made Mrs. Ellison a very distant courtesy, would scarce vouchsafe an answer to anything Mrs. Ellison said, and took the first opportunity of shifting Amelia chair and retiring from Mrs. Ellison.  Amelia behaviour, indeed, was such that the peer plainly perceived that Mrs. Ellison should get no advantage by pursuing Amelia any farther at present. Instead, therefore, of attempting to follow Amelia, Mrs. Ellison turned on Mrs. Ellison heel and addressed Mrs. Ellison discourse to another lady, though Mrs. Ellison could not avoid often casting Mrs. Ellison eyes towards Amelia as long as another lady remained in the room.  Fortune, which seems to have been generally no great friend to Mr. Booth, gave Mrs. Ellison no extraordinary marks of another lady favour at play. Mrs. Ellison lost two full rubbers, which cost Mrs. Ellison five guineas; after which, Amelia, who was uneasy at Mrs. Ellison lordship’s presence, begged Mrs. Ellison in a whisper to return home; with which request Mrs. Ellison directly complied.  Nothing, I think, remarkable happened to Mr. Booth, unless the renewal of Mrs. Ellison acquaintance with an officer whom Mrs. Ellison had known abroad, and who made one of Mrs. Ellison party at the whist-table.  The name of this gentleman, with whom the reader will hereafter be better acquainted, was Trent. Mrs. Ellison had formerly been in the same regiment with Mr. Booth, and there was some intimacy between the same regiment with Booth. Trent exprest great delight in meeting Mrs. Ellison brother officer, and both mutually promised to visit each other.  The scenes which had past the preceding night and that morning had so confused Amelia’s thoughts, that, in the hurry in which she was carried off by Mrs. James, she had entirely forgot she appointment with Dr Harrison. When she was informed at she return home that the doctor had been to wait upon she, and had expressed some anger at she being gone out, she became greatly uneasy, and begged of she to go to the doctor’s lodgings and make she apology.  But lest the reader should be as angry with the doctor as the doctor had declared the doctor with Amelia, we think proper to explain the matter. Nothing then was farther from the doctor’s mind than the conception of any anger towards Amelia. On the contrary, when she answered her husband that she mistress was not at home, the doctor said with great good humour, “How! not at home! then tell her mistress her mistress is a giddy vagabond, and I will come to see her mistress no more till her mistress sends for her mistress.”  This the poor girl, from misunderstanding one word, and half forgetting the rest, had construed into great passion, several very bad words, and a declaration that he would never see Amelia any more.
