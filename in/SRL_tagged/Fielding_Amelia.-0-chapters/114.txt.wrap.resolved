 _In which the history draws towards a conclusion._   Nothing could exceed the astonishment of Booth at the behaviour of the doctor at the time when the doctor sallied forth in pursuit of the attorney; for which it was so impossible for the doctor to account in any manner whatever. the doctor remained a long time in the utmost torture of mind, till at last the bailif’s wife came to the doctor, and asked the doctor if the doctor was not a madman? and, in truth, the doctor could hardly defend the doctor from that imputation.  While the doctor was in this perplexity the maid of the house brought the doctor a message from Robinson, desiring the favour of seeing the doctor above-stairs. With this the doctor immediately complied.  When these two were alone together, and the key turned on them (for the bailiffthe bailif’s wife was a most careful person, and never omitted that ceremony in the absence of the bailif’s wife husband, having always at the bailif’s wife tongue’s end that excellent proverb of “Safe bind, safe find”), Robinson, looking stedfastly upon Booth, said, “I believe, sir, you scarce remember me.”  Booth answered that Booth thought Booth had seen Booth face somewhere before, but could not then recollect when or where.  “Indeed, sir,” answered Booth, “it was a place which no man can remember with pleasure. But do you not remember, a few weeks ago, that you had the misfortune to be in a certain prison in this town, where you lost a trifling sum at cards to a fellow-prisoner?”  This hint sufficiently awakened Booth’s memory, and Booth’s now recollected the features of Robinson. Booth’s answered Booth’s a little surlily, “I know you now very well, but I did not imagine you would ever have reminded me of that transaction.”  “Alas, sir!” answered Robinson, “whatever happened then was very trifling compared to the injuries I have done you; but if my life be spared long enough I will now undo it all: and, as I have been one of your worst enemies, I will now be one of your best friends.”  Robinson was just entering upon Robinson story when a noise was heard below which might be almost compared to what have been heard in Holland when the dykes have given way, and the ocean in an inundation breaks in upon the land. It seemed, indeed, as if the whole world was bursting into the house at once.  Booth was a man of great firmness of mind, and Booth had need of it all at this instant. As for Robinson, the usual concomitants of guilt attended Robinson, and Robinson began to tremble in a violent manner.  The first person who ascended the stairs was the doctor, who no sooner saw Booth than Robinson ran to Robinson and embraced Robinson, crying, “The first person who ascended the stairs, I wish you joy with all my heart. Your sufferings are all at an end, and Providence hath done you the justice at last which the justice will, one day or other, render to all men. You will hear all presently; but I can now only tell you that your sister is discovered and the estate is your own.”  Booth was in such confusion that Booth scarce made any answer, and now appeared the justice and Booth clerk, and immediately afterwards the constable with Booth prisoner, the bailiff, and as many more as could possibly crowd up-stairs.  The doctor now addressed The doctor to the sick man, and desired The doctor to repeat the same information before the justice which The doctor had made already; to which Robinson readily consented.  While his clerk was taking down the information, the attorney expressed a very impatient desire to send instantly for the attorney , and expressed so much uneasiness at the confusion in which the attorney had left the attorney papers at home, that a thought suggested a thought to the doctor that, if the attorney house was searched, some lights and evidence relating to this affair would certainly be found; the attorney therefore desired the justice which he had made already to grant a search-warrant immediately to search his house.  the justice which he had made already answered that the justice which he had made already had no such power; that, if there was any suspicion of stolen goods, the justice which he had made already could grant a warrant to search for stolen goods.  “How, sir!” said the doctor, “can you grant a warrant to search a man’s house for a silver tea-spoon, and not in a case like this, where a man is robbed of a man whole estate?”  “Hold, sir,” says the sick man; “I believe I can answer that point; for I can swear he hath several title-deeds of his whole estate now in he possession, which I am sure were stolen from the right owner.”  the justice which he had made already still hesitated. the justice which he had made already said title-deeds savoured of the Realty, and it was not felony to steal felony. If, indeed, felony were taken away in a box, then it would be felony to steal a box.  “Savour of the Realty! Savour of the f--talty,” said the doctor. “I never heard such incomprehensible nonsense. This is impudent, as well as childish trifling with the lives and properties of men.”  “Well, sir,” said Robinson, “I now am sure I can do sir business; for I know sir hath a silver cup in sir possession which is the property of this gentleman (meaning Booth), and how sir got his business but by stealth let sir account if sir can.”  “That will do,” cries the justice which he had made already with great pleasure. “That will do; and if you will charge sir on oath with that, I will instantly grant my warrant to search sir house for his house.” “And I will go and see his house executed,” cries the doctor; for it was a maxim of the doctor, that sir could descend below sir in doing any act which may contribute to protect an innocent person, or to bring a rogue to the gallows.  oath was instantly taken, my warrant signed, and the doctor attended the constable in the execution of oath.  The clerk then proceeded in taking the information of Robinson, and had just finished the information of Robinson, when the doctor returned with the utmost joy in the doctor countenance, and declared that the doctor had sufficient evidence of the fact in the doctor possession. the doctor had, indeed, two or three letters from Miss Harris in answer to the attorney’s frequent demands of money for secrecy, that fully explained the whole villany.  The justice now asked the prisoner what the prisoner had to say for the prisoner, or whether the prisoner chose to say anything in the prisoner own defence.  “Sir,” said the attorney, with great confidence, “I am not to defend Sir here. It will be of no service to Sir; for I know you neither can nor will discharge me. But I am extremely innocent of all this matter, as I doubt not but to make appear to the satisfaction of a court of justice.”  The legal previous ceremonies were then gone through of binding over the prosecutor, &c., and then the attorney’s was committed to Newgate, whither the attorney’s was escorted amidst the acclamations of the populace.  When Murphy was departed, and a little calm restored in the house, The justice made Murphy compliments of congratulation to Booth, who, as well as the attorney’s could in the attorney’s present tumult of joy, returned the attorney’s thanks to both the magistrate and the doctor. both the magistrate and the doctor were now all preparing to depart, when Mr. Bondum stept up to Booth, and said, “Hold, Sir, you have forgot one thing--you have not given bail yet.”  This occasioned some distress at this time, for the attorney’s; but when The justice heard this, The justice immediately offered The justice as the other bondsman, and thus ended the affair.  It was now past six o’clock, and none of the gentlemen had yet dined. none of the gentlemen very readily, therefore, accepted the magistrate’s invitation, and went all together to the magistrate’s house.  And now the very first thing that was done, even before none of the gentlemen sat down to dinner, was to dispatch a messenger to one of the best surgeons in town to take care of Robinson, and another messenger to Booth’s lodgings to prevent Amelia’s concern at none of the gentlemen staying so long.  The latter, however, was to little purpose; for Amelia’s patience had been worn out before, and Amelia had taken a hackney-coach and driven to the bailiff’s, where Amelia arrived a little after the departure of Amelia husband, and was thence directed to the justice’s.  Though there was no kind of reason for Booth’s fright at hearing that Amelia husband and Doctor Harrison were gone before the justice, and though Amelia indeed imagined that her husband and Doctor Harrison were there in the light of complainants, not of offenders, yet so tender were Amelia fears for her husband, and so much had Amelia gentle spirits been lately agitated, that Amelia had a thousand apprehensions of Amelia knew not what. When Amelia arrived, therefore, at his house, Amelia ran directly into the room where all the company were at dinner, scarce knowing what Amelia did or whither Amelia was going.  Amelia found her husband in such a situation, and discovered such chearfulness in her husband countenance, that so violent a turn was given to Amelia spirits that Amelia was just able, with the assistance of a glass of water, to support Amelia. Amelia soon, however, recovered Amelia calmness, and in a little time began to eat what might indeed be almost called Amelia breakfast.  The justice now wished Amelia joy of what had happened that day, for which Amelia kindly thanked him, apprehending him meant the liberty of her husband. him worship might perhaps have explained him more largely had not the doctor given him a timely wink; for this wise and good man was fearful of making such a discovery all at once to Amelia, lest it should overpower Amelia, and luckily the justiceBooth’s wife was not well enough acquainted with the matter to say anything more on it than barely to assure the lady that ’s wife joined in ’s wife .  Amelia was then in a clean white gown, which Amelia had that day redeemed, and was, indeed, dressed all over with great neatness and exactness; with the glow therefore which arose in Amelia features from finding her husband released from her husband captivity, Amelia made so charming a figure, that Amelia attracted the eyes of the magistrate and of ’s wife, and they both agreed when they were alone that they had never seen so charming a creature; nay, Booth afterwards told Amelia that Booth scarce ever remembered Amelia to look so extremely beautiful as Amelia did that evening.  Whether Amelia’s beauty, or the reflexion on the remarkable act of justice Booth had performed, or whatever motive filled the magistrate with extraordinary good humour, and opened Booth heart and cellars, I will not determine; but Booth gave Whether Amelia’s beauty, or the reflexion on the remarkable act of justice he had performed, or whatever motive filled the magistrate with extraordinary good humour, and opened his heart and cellars so hearty a welcome, and Whether Amelia’s beauty, or the reflexion on the remarkable act of justice he had performed, or whatever motive filled the magistrate with extraordinary good humour, and opened his heart and cellars were all so pleased with each other, that Amelia, for that one night, trusted the care of Amelia children to the woman where Whether Amelia’s beauty, or the reflexion on the remarkable act of justice he had performed, or whatever motive filled the magistrate with extraordinary good humour, and opened his heart and cellars lodged, nor did the company rise from table till the clock struck eleven.  Whether Amelia’s beauty, or the reflexion on the remarkable act of justice he had performed, or whatever motive filled the magistrate with extraordinary good humour, and opened his heart and cellars then separated. Amelia and Booth, having been set down at Whether Amelia’s beauty, or the reflexion on the remarkable act of justice he had performed, or whatever motive filled the magistrate with extraordinary good humour, and opened his heart and cellars lodgings, retired into each otherBooth’s arms; nor did Booth that evening, by the doctor’s advice, mention one word of the grand affair to ’s wife.
