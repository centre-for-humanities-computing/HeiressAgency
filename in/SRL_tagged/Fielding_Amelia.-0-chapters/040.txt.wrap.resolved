 _Containing various matters._   A fortnight had now passed since Booth had seen or heard from the colonel, which did not a little surprize Booth, as they had parted so good friends, and as Booth had so cordially undertaken Booth cause concerning the memorial on which all Booth hopes depended.  The uneasiness which this gave Booth farther encreased on finding that Booth friend refused to see Booth; for Booth had paid the colonel a visit at nine in the morning, and was told Booth was not stirring; and at Booth return back an hour afterwards the servant said the servant master was gone out, of which Booth was certain of the falsehood; for the servant had, during that whole hour, walked backwards and forwards within sight of the colonel’s door, and must have seen the servant if the servant had gone out within that time.  the colonel, however, did not long suffer the servant to continue in the deplorable state of anxiety; for, the very next morning, Booth received Booth memorial enclosed in a letter, acquainting Booth that Mr. James had mentioned Mr. James affair to the person Mr. James proposed, but that the great man had so many engagements on the great man hands that it was impossible for the great man to make any further promises at this time.  The cold and distant stile of this letter, and, indeed, the whole behaviour of Mr. James, so different from what it had been formerly, had something so mysterious in it, that it greatly puzzled and perplexed poor Booth; and it was so long before he was able to solve it, that the reader’s curiosity will, perhaps, be obliged to us for not leaving he so long in the dark as to this matter. The true reason, then, of the colonel’s conduct was this: the colonel unbounded generosity, together with the unbounded extravagance and consequently the great necessity of Miss Matthews, had at length overcome the cruelty of that lady, with whom the colonel likewise had luckily no rival. Above all, the desire of being revenged on Booth, with whom she was to the highest degree enraged, had, perhaps, contributed not a little to the colonel success; for she had no sooner condescended to a familiarity with she new lover, and discovered that Captain James, of whom she had heard so much from Booth, was no other than the identical colonel, than she employed every art of which she was mistress to make an utter breach of friendship between these two. For this purpose she did not scruple to insinuate that the colonel not at all obliged to the character given of the colonel by the colonel friend, and to the account of this latter she placed most of the cruelty which she had shewn to the former.  Had the colonel made a proper use of the colonel reason, and fairly examined the probability of the fact, the colonel could scarce have been imposed upon to believe a matter so inconsistent with all the colonel knew of Booth, and in which that gentleman must have sinned against all the laws of honour without any visible temptation. But, in solemn fact, the colonel was so intoxicated with the colonel love, that it was in the power of the colonel mistress to have persuaded the colonel of anything; besides, the colonel had an interest in giving she credit, for the colonel was not a little pleased with finding a reason for hating the man whom the colonel could not help hating without any reason, at least, without any which the colonel durst fairly assign even to the colonel. Henceforth, therefore, the colonel abandoned all friendship for Booth, and was more inclined to put the colonel out of the world than to endeavour any longer at supporting the colonel in it.  Booth communicated this letter to Booth wife, who endeavoured, as usual, to the utmost of her power, to console the colonel under one of the greatest afflictions which, I think, can befal a man, namely, the unkindness of a friend; but the colonel had luckily at the same time the greatest blessing in the colonel possession, the kindness of a faithful and beloved wife. A blessing, however, which, though it compensates most of the evils of life, rather serves to aggravate the misfortune of distressed circumstances, from the consideration of the share which her is to bear in distressed circumstances.  This afternoon her received a second visit from Mrs. Ellison, who acquainted her that her had a present of a ticket for the oratorio, which would carry two persons into the gallery; and therefore begged the favour of her company thither.  Amelia, with many thanks, acknowledged the civility of Mrs. Ellison, but declined accepting her offer; upon which Booth very strenuously insisted on her going, and said to her, “My dear, if you knew the satisfaction I have in any of your pleasures, I am convinced you would not refuse the favour Mrs. Ellison is so kind to offer you; for, as you are a lover of music, you, who have never been at an oratorio, cannot conceive how you will be delighted.” “I well know your goodness, my dear,” answered her, “but I cannot think of leaving my children without some person more proper to take care of my children than her.” Mrs. Ellison removed this objection by offering Mrs. Ellison own servant, a very discreet matron, to attend her own servant, a very discreet matron; but notwithstanding this, and all Mrs. Ellison could say, with the assistance of Booth, and of the children themselves, her still persisted in her refusal; and the mistress of the house, who knew how far good breeding allows persons to be pressing on these occasions, took Mrs. Ellison leave.  Mrs. Ellison was no sooner departed than her, looking tenderly on Mrs. Ellison husband, said, “How can you, my dear creature, think that music hath any charms for me at this time? or, indeed, do you believe that I am capable of any sensation worthy the name of pleasure when neither you nor my children are present or bear any part of my children?”  An officer of the regiment to which Booth had formerly belonged, hearing from Atkinson where Atkinson lodged, now came to pay Atkinson a visit. Atkinson told Atkinson that several of their old acquaintance were to meet the next Wednesday at a tavern, and very strongly pressed Atkinson to be one of the company. Booth was, in truth, what is called a hearty fellow, and loved now and then to take a chearful glass with Booth friends; but Booth excused Booth at this time. Booth friend declared Booth would take no denial, and Booth growing very importunate, her at length seconded Booth. Upon Booth Booth answered, “Well, my dear, since you desire me, I will comply, but on one condition, that you go at the same time to the oratorio.” her thought this request reasonable enough, and gave her consent; of which Mrs. Ellison presently received the news, and with great satisfaction.  this request may perhaps be asked why Booth could go to a tavern, and not to the oratorio with Booth wife? In truth, then, a tavern was within hallowed ground, that is to say, in the verge of the court; for, of five officers that were to meet there, three, besides Booth, were confined to that air which hath been always found extremely wholesome to a broken military constitution. And here, if the good reader will pardon the pun, the good reader will scarce be offended at the observation; since, how is it possible that, without running in debt, any person should maintain the dress and appearance of a gentleman whose income is not half so good as that of a porter? It is true that this allowance, small as it is, is a great expense to the public; but, if several more unnecessary charges were spared, the public might, perhaps, bear a little encrease of this without much feeling a little encrease of this. They would not, I am sure, have equal reason to complain at contributing to the maintenance of a sett of brave fellows, who, at the hazard of They health, They limbs, and They lives, have maintained the safety and honour of They country, as when They find They taxed to the support of a sett of drones, who have not the least merit or claim to They favour, and who, without contributing in any manner to the good of the hive, live luxuriously on the labours of the industrious bee.
