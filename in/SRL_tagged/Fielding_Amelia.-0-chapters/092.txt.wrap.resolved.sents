 _Consequences of the masquerade, not uncommon nor surprizing_.
The lady, getting first out of The lady chair, ran hastily up into the nursery to the children; for such was Amelia’s constant method at The lady return home, at whatever hour.
Booth then walked into the dining-room, where Booth had not been long before Amelia came down to Booth, and, with a most chearful countenance, said, “My dear, I fancy we have neither of we supped; shall I go down and see whether there is any cold meat in the house?”  “For yourself, if you please,” answered Booth; “but I shall eat nothing.”  “How, my dear!” said Amelia; “I hope you have not lost your appetite at the masquerade!” for supper was a meal at which he generally eat very heartily.
“I know not well what I have lost,” said Booth; “I find myself disordered.--My head aches.
I know not what is the matter with me.”  “Indeed, My dear, you frighten me,” said Amelia; “you look, indeed, disordered.
I wish the masquerade had been far enough before you had gone thither.”  “Would to Heaven you had gone thither had!” cries Booth; “but that is over now.
But pray, Amelia, answer me one question--Who was that gentleman with yourself when I came up to yourself?”  “that gentleman!
my dear,” said Amelia; “what gentleman?”  “The gentleman--the nobleman--when I came up; sure I speak plain.”  “Upon my word, My dear, I don’t understand you,” answered Amelia; “I did not know one person at the masquerade.”  “How!” said he; “what!
spend the whole evening with a masque without knowing he?”  “Why, My dear,” said Amelia, “you know we were not together.”  “I know we were not,” said he, “but what is that to the purpose?
Sure you answer me strangely.
I know we were not together; and therefore I ask you whom you were with?”  “Nay, but, My dear,” said Amelia, “can I tell people in masques?”  “I say again, madam,” said he, “would you converse two hours or more with a masque whom you did not know?”  “Indeed, child,” says Amelia, “I know nothing of the methods of a masquerade; for I never was at one in my life.”  “I wish to Heaven you had not been at this!” cries Booth.
“Nay, you will wish so yourself if you tell me truth.--What have I said?
do I--can I suspect you of not speaking truth?
Since you are ignorant then I will inform you: the man you have conversed with was no other than Lord----.”  “And is that the reason,” said Amelia, “you wish I had not been there?”  “And is not that reason,” answered he, “sufficient?
Is he not the last man upon earth with whom I would have you converse?”  “So you really wish then that I had not been at the masquerade?”  “I do,” cried he, “from my soul.”  “So may I ever be able,” cried Amelia, “to indulge you in every wish as in this.--I was not there.”  “Do not trifle, Amelia,” cried he; “you would not jest with he if you knew the situation of my mind.”  “Indeed I do not jest with you,” said Amelia.
“Upon my honour I was not there.
Forgive me this first deceit I ever practised, and indeed it shall be the last; for I have paid severely for this by the uneasiness it hath given me.” Amelia then revealed to indeed it shall be the last; for I have paid severely for this by the uneasiness it hath given me the whole secret, which was thus:  I think it hath been already mentioned in some part of this history that Amelia and Mrs. Atkinson were exactly of the same make and stature, and that there was likewise a very near resemblance between Amelia and Mrs. Atkinson voices.
When Mrs. Atkinson, therefore, found that Amelia was so extremely averse to the masquerade, Mrs. Atkinson proposed to go thither in Mrs. Atkinson stead, and to pass upon Booth for Booth own wife.
This was afterwards very easily executed; for, when they left Booth’s lodgings, Amelia, who went last to Mrs. Atkinson chair, ran back to fetch Mrs. Atkinson masque, as Mrs. Atkinson pretended, which Mrs. Atkinson had purposely left behind.
Mrs. Atkinson then whipt off Mrs. Atkinson domino, and threw her domino over Mrs. Atkinson, who stood ready to receive her domino, and ran immediately downstairs, and, stepping into Amelia’s chair, proceeded with the rest to the masquerade.
As Mrs. Atkinson stature exactly suited that of Amelia, Mrs. Atkinson had very little difficulty to carry on the imposition; for, besides the natural resemblance of their voices, and the opportunity of speaking in a feigned one, Mrs. Atkinson had scarce an intercourse of six words with Booth during the whole time; for the moment their got into the croud Mrs. Atkinson took the first opportunity of slipping from him.
And him, as the reader may remember, being seized by other women, and concluding him wife to be safe with Mrs. James, was very well satisfied, till the colonel set him upon the search, as we have seen before.
Mrs. Atkinson, the moment Mrs. Atkinson came home, ran upstairs to the nursery, where Mrs. Atkinson found Amelia, and told Mrs. Atkinson in haste that Mrs. Atkinson might very easily carry on the deceit with Mrs. Atkinson husband; for that Mrs. Atkinson might tell her husband what Mrs. Atkinson pleased to invent, as they had not been a minute together during the whole evening.
Booth was no sooner satisfied that his wife had not been from home that evening than Booth fell into raptures with Mrs. Atkinson, gave Mrs. Atkinson a thousand tender caresses, blamed Booth own judgment, acknowledged the goodness of hers, and vowed never to oppose Mrs. Atkinson will more in any one instance during Booth life.
Mrs. Atkinson, who was still in the nursery with Mrs. Atkinson masquerade dress, was then summoned down-stairs, and, when Booth saw Mrs. Atkinson and heard Mrs. Atkinson speak in Mrs. Atkinson mimic tone, Booth declared Booth was not surprized at Booth having been imposed upon, for that, if Mrs. Atkinson, who was still in the nursery with her masquerade dress were both in the same disguise, Booth should scarce be able to discover the difference between they were both in the same disguise.
Mrs. Atkinson, who was still in the nursery with her masquerade dress then sat down to half an hour’s chearful conversation, after which Mrs. Atkinson, who was still in the nursery with her masquerade dress retired all in the most perfect good humour.
