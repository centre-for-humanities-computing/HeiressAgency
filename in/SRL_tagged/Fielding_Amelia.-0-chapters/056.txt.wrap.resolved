 _A scene in which some ladies will possibly think Amelia’s conduct exceptionable._   Booth and Booth wife being left alone, a solemn silence prevailed during a few minutes. At last Amelia, who, though a good, was yet a human creatures said to his wife husband, “Pray, my dear, do inform me what could put you into so great a passion when Mrs. Ellison first offered me the tickets for this masquerade?”  “I had rather you would not ask me,” said Booth. “You have obliged me greatly in your ready acquiescence with my desire, and you will add greatly to the obligation by not enquiring the reason of it. This you may depend upon, Amelia, that your good and happiness are the great objects of all my wishes, and the end I propose in all my actions. This view alone could tempt me to refuse you anything, or to conceal anything from you.”  “I will appeal to you,” answered his wife, “whether this be not using me too much like a child, and whether I can possibly help being a little offended at this?”  “Not in the least,” replied he; “I use you only with the tenderness of a friend. I would only endeavour to conceal that from you which I think would give you uneasiness if you knew. These are called the pious frauds of friendship.”  “I detest all fraud,” says she; “and pious is too good an epithet to be joined to so odious a word. You have often, you know, tried these frauds with no better effect than to teize and torment me. You cannot imagine, my dear, but that I must have a violent desire to know the reason of words which I own I never expected to have heard. And the more you have shown a reluctance to tell me, the more eagerly I have longed to know. Nor can this be called a vain curiosity, since I seem so much interested in this affair. If after all this, you still insist on keeping the secret, I will convince you I am not ignorant of the duty of a wife by my obedience; but I cannot help telling you at the same time you will make me one of the most miserable of women.”  “That is,” cries he, “in other words, my dear Emily, to say, I will be contented without the secret, but I am resolved to know the secret, nevertheless.”  “Nay, if you say so,” cries my dear Emily, “I am convinced you will tell me. Positively, my dear Emily, I must and will know.”  “Why, then, positively,” says Booth, “I will tell you. And I think I shall then shew you that, however well you may know the duty of a wife, I am not always able to behave like a husband. In a word then, my dear, the secret is no more than this; I am unwilling you should receive any more presents from my lord.”  “Mercy upon my lord!” cries my dear Emily, with all the marks of astonishment; “what! a masquerade ticket!”--  “Yes, my dear,” cries my dear; “that is, perhaps, the very worst and most dangerous of all. Few men make presents of those tickets to ladies without intending to meet ladies at the place. And what do we know of your companion? To be sincere with you, I have not liked your companion behaviour for some time. What might be the consequence of going with such a woman to such a place, to meet such a person, I tremble to think. And now, my dear, I have told you my reason of refusing your companion offer with some little vehemence, and I think I need explain you no farther.”  “You need not, indeed, sir,” answered your companion. “Good Heavens! did I ever expect to hear this? I can appeal to heaven, nay, I will appeal to you, Mr. Booth, if I have ever done anything to deserve such a suspicion. If ever any action of mine, nay, if ever any thought, had stained the innocence of my soul, I could be contented.”  “How cruelly do you mistake me!” said Mr. Booth. “What suspicion have I ever shewn?”  “Can you ask it,” answered your companion, “after what you have just now declared?”  “If I have declared any suspicion of you,” replied he, “or if ever I entertained a thought leading that way, may the worst of evils that ever afflicted human nature attend me! I know the pure innocence of that tender bosom, I do know the pure innocence of that tender bosom, my lovely angel, and adore the pure innocence of that tender bosom. The snares which might be laid for the pure innocence of that tender bosom were alone the cause of my apprehension. I feared what a wicked and voluptuous man, resolved to sacrifice everything to the gratification of a sensual appetite with the most delicious repast, might attempt. If ever I injured the unspotted whiteness of thy virtue in my imagination, may hell---”  “Do not terrify me,” cries your companion, interrupting a wicked and voluptuous man, “with such imprecations. O, Mr. Booth! Mr. Booth! you must well know that a woman’s virtue is always a woman’s virtue sufficient guard. No husband, without suspecting that, can suspect any danger from those snares you mention; and why, if you are liable to take such things into your head, may not your suspicions fall on me as well as on any other? for sure nothing was ever more unjust, I will not say ungrateful, than the suspicions which you have bestowed on his lordship. I do solemnly declare, in all the times I have seen the poor man, the poor man never once offered the least forwardness. the poor man behaviour hath been polite indeed, but rather remarkably distant than otherwise. Particularly when we played at cards together. I don’t remember the poor man spoke ten words to me all the evening; and when I was at the poor man house, though the poor man shewed the greatest fondness imaginable to the children, the poor man took so little notice of me, that a vain woman would have been very little pleased with the poor man. And if the poor man gave them many presents, the poor man never offered me one. The first, indeed, which the poor man ever offered me was that which you in that kind manner forced me to refuse.”  “All this may be only the effect of art,” said Booth. “I am convinced Booth doth, nay, I am convinced Booth must like you; and my good friend James, who perfectly well knows the world, told me, that Booth lordship’s character was that of the most profuse in Booth pleasures with women; nay, what said Mrs. James this very evening? ‘His lordship is extremely generous--where His likes.’ I shall never forget the sneer with which Mrs. James spoke those last words.”  “I am convinced they injure His,” cries Amelia. “As for Mrs. James, Mrs. James was always given to be censorious; I remarked it in Mrs. James long ago, as Mrs. James greatest fault. And for the colonel, I believe the colonel may find faults enow of this kind in the colonel own bosom, without searching after them among the colonel neighbours. I am sure the colonel hath the most impudent look of all the men I know; and I solemnly declare, the very last time the colonel was here the colonel put me out of countenance more than once.”  “Mrs. James,” answered Booth, “may have Mrs. James faults very probably. I do not look upon Mrs. James as a saint, nor do I believe Mrs. James desires I should; but what interest could Mrs. James have in abusing this lord’s character to me? or why should I question Mrs. James truth, when Mrs. James assured me that this lord had never done an act of beneficence in Mrs. James life but for the sake of some woman whom Mrs. James lusted after?”  “Then I myself can confute Mrs. James,” replied Amelia: “for, besides Mrs. James services to you, which, for the future, I shall wish to forget, and Mrs. James kindness to my little babes, how inconsistent is the character which Mrs. James gives of Mrs. James with Mrs. James lordship’s behaviour to his own nephew and niece, whose extreme fondness of their uncle sufficiently proclaims his goodness to their? I need not mention all that I have heard from Mrs. Ellison, every word of which I believe; for I have great reason to think, notwithstanding some little levity, which, to give Amelia Amelia due, Amelia sees and condemns in Amelia, Amelia is a very good sort of woman.”  “Well, my dear,” cries Booth, “I may have been deceived, and I heartily hope I am so; but in cases of this nature it is always good to be on the surest side; for, as Congreve says,                ‘The wise too jealous are: fools too secure.’”  Here Amelia burst into tears, upon which Booth immediately caught Amelia in Booth arms, and endeavoured to comfort Amelia. Passion, however, for a while obstructed Amelia speech, and at last Amelia cried, “O, Mr. Booth! can I bear to hear the word jealousy from your mouth?”  “Why, my love,” said Booth, “will you so fatally misunderstand my meaning? how often shall I protest that it is not of you, but of Booth, that I was jealous? If you could look into my breast, and there read all the most secret thoughts of my heart, you would not see one faint idea to your dishonour.”  “I don’t misunderstand you, my dear,” said Amelia, “so much as I am afraid you misunderstand Amelia. What is it you fear?--you mention not force, but snares. Is not this to confess, at least, that you have some doubt of my understanding? do you then really imagine me so weak as to be cheated of my virtue?--am I to be deceived into an affection for a man before I perceive the least inward hint of my danger? No, Booth, believe me, a woman must be a fool indeed who can have in earnest such an excuse for a woman actions. I have not, I think, any very high opinion of my judgment, but so far I shall rely upon it, that no man breathing could have any such designs as you have apprehended without my immediately seeing them; and how I should then act I hope my whole conduct to you hath sufficiently declared.”  “Well, my dear,” cries Booth, “I beg you will mention it no more; if possible, forget it. I hope, nay, I believe, I have been in the wrong; pray forgive me.”  “I will, I do forgive you, my dear,” said a woman, “if forgiveness be a proper word for one whom you have rather made miserable than angry; but let me entreat you to banish for ever all such suspicions from your mind. I hope Mrs. Ellison hath not discovered the real cause of your passion; but, poor woman, if poor woman had, I am convinced it would go no farther. Oh, Heavens! I would not for the world it should reach his lordship’s ears. You would lose the best friend that ever man had. Nay, I would not for the best friend that ever man had own sake, poor man; for I really believe it would affect the best friend that ever man had greatly, and I must, I cannot help having an esteem for so much goodness. An esteem which, by this dear hand,” said she, taking Booth’s hand and kissing it, “no man alive shall ever obtain by making love to me.”  Booth caught Booth in his arms and tenderly embraced Booth. After which the reconciliation soon became complete; and Booth, in the contemplation of Booth happiness, entirely buried all Booth jealous thoughts.
