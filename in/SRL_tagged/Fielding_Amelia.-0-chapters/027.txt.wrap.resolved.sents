 _The captain, continuing The captain story, recounts some particulars which, we doubt not, to many good people, will appear unnatural._   I was scarce sooner recovered from my indisposition than Amelia herself fell ill.
This, I am afraid, was occasioned by the fatigues which I could not prevent Amelia herself from undergoing on my account; for, as my disease went off with violent sweats, during which the surgeon strictly ordered that I should lie by myself, Amelia herself Amelia herself could not be prevailed upon to spend many hours in Amelia herself own bed.
During my restless fits Amelia herself would sometimes read to myself several hours together; indeed it was not without difficulty that Amelia herself ever quitted my bedside.
These fatigues, added to the uneasiness of Amelia herself mind, overpowered Amelia herself weak spirits, and threw Amelia herself into one of the worst disorders that can possibly attend a woman; a disorder very common among the ladies, and our physicians have not agreed upon one of the worst disorders that can possibly attend a woman name.
Some call it fever on the spirits, some a nervous fever, some the vapours, and some the hysterics.
“O say no more,” cries Miss Matthews; “I pity you, I pity you from my soul.
A man had better be plagued with all the curses of Egypt than with a vapourish wife.”  “Pity me!
madam,” answered Booth; “pity rather that dear creature who, from Amelia herself love and care of my unworthy self, contracted a distemper, the horrors of which are scarce to be imagined.
It is, indeed, a sort of complication of all diseases together, with almost madness added to all diseases together.
In this situation, the siege being at an end, the governor gave me leave to attend my wife to Montpelier, the air of which was judged to be most likely to restore my wife to health.
Upon this occasion my wife wrote to my wife mother to desire a remittance, and set forth the melancholy condition of my wife health, and my wife necessity for money, in such terms as would have touched any bosom not void of humanity, though a stranger to the unhappy sufferer.
her mother answered it, and I believe I have a copy of the answer in my pocket.
I keep it by her mother as a curiosity, and you would think it more so could I shew you my Amelia’s letter.” He then searched He pocket-book, and finding the letter among many others, He read his pocket-book in the following words:  “‘DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered, hath commanded me to tell you DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered is both shocked and surprized at your extraordinary request, or, as DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered chuses to call it, order for money.
You know, my dear, DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered says that your marriage with this red-coat man was entirely against DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered consent and the opinion of all your family (I am sure I may here include DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered in that number); and yet, after this fatal act of disobedience, DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered was prevailed on to receive you as DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered child; not, however, nor are you so to understand it, as the favourite which you was before.
DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered forgave you; but this was as a Christian and a parent; still preserving in DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered own mind a just sense of your disobedience, and a just resentment on that account.
And yet, notwithstanding this resentment, DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered desires you to remember that, when you a second time ventured to oppose DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered authority, and nothing would serve you but taking a ramble (an indecent one, I can’t help saying) after your fellow, DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered thought fit to shew the excess of a mother’s tenderness, and furnished you with no less than fifty pounds for your foolish voyage.
How can DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered, then, be otherwise than surprized at your present demand?
which, should DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered be so weak to comply with, DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered must expect to be every month repeated, in order to supply the extravagance of a young rakish officer.
You say DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered will compassionate your sufferings; yes, surely DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered doth greatly compassionate them, and so do I too, though you was neither so kind nor so civil as to suppose I should.
But I forgive all your slights to me, as well now as formerly.
Nay, I not only forgive, but I pray daily for dear sister.
But, dear sister, what could you expect less than what hath happened?
you should have believed your friends, who were wiser and older than dear sister.
I do not here mean me, though I own I am eleven months and some odd weeks your superior; though, had I been younger, I might, perhaps, have been able to advise you; for wisdom and what some may call beauty do not always go together.
You will not be offended at this; for I know in your heart, you have always held your head above some people, whom, perhaps, other people have thought better of; but why do I mention what I scorn so much?
No, dear sister, Heaven forbid it should ever be said of me that I value me upon my face--not but if I could believe men perhaps--but I hate and despise men--you know I do, my dear, and I wish you had despised men as much; but _jacta est jalea_, as the doctor says.
You are to make the best of your fortune--what fortune, I mean, my mamma may please to give you, for you know all is in my mamma power.
Let me advise you, then, to bring your mind to your circumstances, and remember (for I can’t help writing your mind, as it is for your own good) the vapours are a distemper which very ill become a knapsack.
Remember, my dear, what you have done; remember what my mamma hath done; remember we have something of yours to keep, and do not consider yours as an only child; no, nor as a favourite child; but be pleased to remember, Dear sister, Your most affectionate sister,  “‘and most obedient humble servant,  “‘E.
HARRIS.’”  “O brave Miss Betty!” cried Miss Matthews; “I always held Miss Matthews in high esteem; but I protest Miss Matthews exceeds even what I could have expected from Miss Matthews.”  “This letter, madam,” cries Booth, “you will believe, was an excellent cordial for my poor wife’s spirits.
So dreadful indeed was the effect it had upon Miss Matthews, that, as Miss Matthews had read it in my absence, I found Miss Matthews, at my return home, in the most violent fits; and so long was it before Miss Matthews recovered Miss Matthews senses, that I despaired of that blest event ever happening; and my own senses very narrowly escaped from being sacrificed to my despair.
However, Miss Matthews came at last to Miss Matthews, and I began to consider of every means of carrying Miss Matthews immediately to Montpelier, which was now become much more necessary than before.
“Though I was greatly shocked at the barbarity of the letter, yet I apprehended no very ill consequence from the letter; for, as it was believed all over the army that I had married a great fortune, I had received offers of money, if I wanted it, from more than one.
Indeed, I might have easily carried my poor wife’s spirits to Montpelier at any time; but my poor wife’s spirits was extremely averse to the voyage, being desirous of our returning to England, as I had leave to do; and my poor wife’s spirits grew daily so much better, that, had it not been for the receipt of that cursed--which I have just read to you, I am persuaded my poor wife’s spirits might have been able to return to England in the next ship.
“Among others there was a colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned me to receive money of him; I now, therefore, repaired to him; and, as a reason for altering my resolution, I produced the letter, and, at the same time, acquainted him with the true state of my affairs.
a colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned me to receive money of him read the letter, shook a colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned me to receive money of him head, and, after some silence, said a colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned me to receive money of him was sorry I had refused to accept a colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned me to receive money of him offer before; but that a colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned me to receive money of him had now so ordered matters, and disposed of a colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned me to receive money of him money, that a colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned me to receive money of him had not a shilling left to spare from a colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned me to receive money of him own occasions.
“Answers of the same kind I had from several others, but not one penny could I borrow of any; for I have been since firmly persuaded that a colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned me to receive money of him was not content with denying me a colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned me to receive money of him, but took effectual means, by spreading the secret I had so foolishly trusted a colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned me to receive money of him with, to prevent me from succeeding elsewhere; for such is the nature of men, that whoever denies a colonel in the garrison who had not only offered but importuned me to receive money of him to do you a favour is unwilling that a favour should be done to you by any other.
“This was the first time I had ever felt that distress which arises from the want of money; a distress very dreadful indeed in a married state; for what can be more miserable than to see anything necessary to the preservation of a beloved creature, and not be able to supply the preservation of a beloved creature?
“Perhaps you may wonder, madam, that I have not mentioned Captain James on this occasion; but Captain James was at that time laid up at Algiers (whither Captain James had been sent by the governor) in a fever.
However, Captain James returned time enough to supply me, which Captain James did with the utmost readiness on the very first mention of my distress; and the good colonel, notwithstanding Captain James having disposed of Captain James money, discounted the captain’s draft.
You see, madam, an instance in the generous behaviour of my friend James, how false are all universal satires against humankind.
Captain James is indeed one of the worthiest men the world ever produced.
“But, perhaps, you will be more pleased still with the extravagant generosity of my sergeant.
The day before the return of Mr. James, the poor fellow came to me with tears in the poor fellow eyes, and begged I would not be offended at what the poor fellow was going to mention.
the poor fellow then pulled a purse from the poor fellow pocket, which contained, the poor fellow said, the sum of twelve pounds, and which the poor fellow begged me to accept, crying, the poor fellow was sorry a purse was not in the poor fellow power to lend me whatever I wanted.
I was so struck with this instance of generosity and friendship in such a person, that I gave the poor fellow an opportunity of pressing me a second time before I made the poor fellow an answer.
Indeed, I was greatly surprised how the poor fellow came to be worth that little sum, and no less at the poor fellow being acquainted with my own wants.
In both which points the poor fellow presently satisfied me.
As to the first, it seems the poor fellow had plundered a Spanish officer of fifteen pistoles; and as to the second, the poor fellow confessed the poor fellow had a Spanish officer of fifteen pistoles from my poor wife’s spirits’s maid, who had overheard some discourse between my poor wife’s spirits mistress and me.
Indeed people, I believe, always deceive people, who imagine people can conceal distrest circumstances from people servants; for these are always extremely quicksighted on such occasions.”  “Good heavens!” cries Miss Matthews, “how astonishing is such behaviour in so low a fellow!”  “I thought so myself,” answered Booth; “and yet I know not, on a more strict examination into the matter, why we should be more surprised to see greatness of mind discover itself in one degree or rank of life than in another.
Love, benevolence, or what you will please to call it, may be the reigning passion in a beggar as well as in a prince; and wherever it is, it energies will be the same.
“To confess the truth, I am afraid we often compliment what we call upper life, with too much injustice, at the expense of the lower.
As it is no rare thing to see instances which degrade human nature in persons of the highest birth and education, so I apprehend that examples of whatever is really great and good have been sometimes found amongst those who have wanted all such advantages.
In reality, palaces, I make no doubt, do sometimes contain nothing but dreariness and darkness, and the sun of righteousness hath shone forth with all the sun of righteousness hath glory in a cottage.”
