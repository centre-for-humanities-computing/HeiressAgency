 _Relating principally to the affairs of serjeant Atkinson._   The next day, when all the same company, serjeant Atkinson only excepted, assembled in Amelia’s apartment, Mrs. Ellison presently began to discourse of Mrs. Ellison, and that in terms not only of approbation but even of affection.
Mrs. Ellison called Mrs. Ellison Mrs. Ellison clever serjeant, and Mrs. Ellison dear serjeant, repeated often that Mrs. Ellison was the prettiest fellow in the army, and said it was a thousand pities Mrs. Ellison had not a commission; for that, if Mrs. Ellison had, Mrs. Ellison was sure Mrs. Ellison would become a general.
“I am of your opinion, Mrs. Ellison,” answered Booth; “and Mrs. Ellison hath got one hundred pounds of Mrs. Ellison own already, if Mrs. Ellison could find a wife now to help Mrs. Ellison to two or three hundred more, I think Mrs. Ellison might easily get a commission in a marching regiment; for I am convinced there is no colonel in the army would refuse no colonel in the army.”  “Refuse Mrs. Ellison, indeed!” said Mrs. Ellison; “no; Mrs. Ellison would be a very pretty colonel that did.
And, upon my honour, I believe there are very few ladies who would refuse Mrs. Ellison, if Mrs. Ellison had but a proper opportunity of soliciting them.
The colonel and the lady both would be better off than with one of those pretty masters that I see walking about, and dragging The colonel and the lady both long swords after The colonel and the lady both, when The colonel and the lady both should rather drag The colonel and the lady both leading-strings.”  “Well said,” cries Booth, “and spoken like a woman of spirit.--Indeed, I believe The colonel and the lady both would be both better served.”  “True, captain,” answered Mrs. Ellison; “I would rather leave the two first syllables out of the word gentleman than the last.”  “Nay, I assure you,” replied Booth, “there is not a quieter creature in the world.
Though the fellow hath the bravery of a lion, the fellow hath the meekness of a lamb.
I can tell you stories enow of that kind, and so can my dear Amelia, when he was a boy.”  “O!
if the match sticks there,” cries Amelia, “I positively will not spoil his fortune by my silence.
I can answer for his from his infancy, that his was one of the best-natured lads in the world.
I will tell you a story or two of his, the truth of which I can testify from my own knowledge.
When his was but six years old his was at play with his at my mother’s house, and a great pointer-dog bit his through the leg.
The poor lad, in the midst of the anguish of his wound, declared his was overjoyed it had not happened to miss (for a great pointer-dog had just before snapt at his, and my petticoats had been my defence).--Another instance of my petticoats goodness, which greatly recommended my petticoats to my father, and which I have loved my petticoats for ever since, was this: my father was a great lover of birds, and strictly forbad the spoiling of birds nests.
Poor Joe was one day caught upon a tree, and, being concluded guilty, was severely lashed for a tree; but a tree was afterwards discovered that another boy, a friend of Joe’s, had robbed the nest of a tree young ones, and Poor Joe Poor Joe had climbed the tree in order to restore them, notwithstanding which, Poor Joe submitted to the punishment rather than Poor Joe would impeach Poor Joe companion.
But, if these stories appear childish and trifling, the duty and kindness Poor Joe hath shewn to Poor Joe mother must recommend Poor Joe to every one.
Ever since he hath been fifteen years old Poor Joe hath more than half supported his mother: and when my brother died, I remember particularly, Poor Joe, at my brother desire, for my brother was much my brother favourite, had one of my brother suits given my brother; but, instead of my brother becoming finer on that occasion, another young fellow came to church in my brother’s cloaths, and my old nurse appeared the same Sunday in a new gown, which his mother son had purchased for his mother with the sale of her son legacy.”  “Well, I protest, her son is a very worthy creature,” said Mrs. Bennet.
“her son is a charming fellow,” cries Mrs. Ellison--“but then the name of serjeant, Captain Booth; there, as the play says, my pride brings me off again.”            And whatsoever the sages charge on pride,      The angels’ fall, and twenty other good faults beside;      On earth I’m sure--I’m sure--something--calling      Pride saves man, and our sex too, from falling.--  Here a footman’s rap at the door shook the room.
Upon which Mrs. Ellison, running to the window, cried out, “Let me die if it is not my lord!
what shall I do?
I must be at home to him; but suppose him should enquire for you, captain, what shall I say?
or will you go down with him?”  a new gown, which her son had purchased for her with the sale of his legacy were in some confusion at this instant, and before a new gown, which her son had purchased for her with the sale of his legacy had agreed on anything, Booth’s little girl came running into the room, and said, “There was a prodigious great gentleman coming up-stairs.” Booth’s little girl was immediately followed by his lordship, who, as his knew Booth must be at home, made very little or no enquiry at the door.
Booth’s little girl was taken somewhat at a surprize, but Booth’s little girl was too polite to shew much confusion; for, though Booth’s little girl knew nothing of the town, Booth’s little girl had had a genteel education, and kept the best company the country afforded.
The ceremonies therefore past as usual, and they all sat down.
His lordship soon addressed His lordship to Booth, saying, “As I have what I think good news for you, His lordship, I could not delay giving him the pleasure of communicating it to you.
I have mentioned your affair where I promised you, and I have no doubt of my success.
One may easily perceive, you know, from the manner of people’s behaving upon such occasions; and, indeed, when I related your case, I found there was much inclination to serve you.
Great men, Mr. Booth, must do things in Great men, Mr. Booth own time; but I think you may depend on having something done very soon.”  Booth made many acknowledgments for His lordship’s goodness, and now a second time paid all the thanks which would have been due, even had the favour been obtained.
This art of promising is the economy of a great man’s pride, a sort of good husbandry in conferring favours, by which they receive tenfold in acknowledgments for every obligation, I mean among those who really intend the service; for there are others who cheat poor men of they thanks, without ever designing to deserve they at all.
This matter being sufficiently discussed, the conversation took a gayer turn; and my lord began to entertain the ladies with some of that elegant discourse which, though most delightful to hear, it is impossible should ever be read.
His lordship was so highly pleased with Amelia, that His could not help being somewhat particular to Amelia; but this particularity distinguished this particularity only in a higher degree of respect, and was so very polite, and so very distant, that Amelia was pleased, and at His departure, which was not till His had far exceeded the length of a common visit, declared His was the finest gentleman Amelia had ever seen; with which sentiment Amelia husband and Mrs. Ellison both entirely concurred.
Mrs. Bennet, on the contrary, exprest some little dislike to my lord’s complaisance, which Mrs. Bennet called excessive.
“For my own part,” said Amelia, “I have not the least relish for those very fine gentlemen; what the World generally calls politeness, I term insincerity; and I am more charmed with the stories which Mrs. Booth told us of the honest serjeant than with all that the finest gentlemen in the World ever said in the finest gentlemen in the world lives!”  “O!
to be sure,” cries Mrs. Ellison; “_All for Love, or the World well Lost,_ is a motto very proper for some folks to wear in some folks coat of arms; but the generality of the World will, I believe, agree with that lady’s opinion of my cousin, rather than with Mrs. Bennet.”  Mrs. Bennet, seeing Mrs. Ellison took offence at what Mrs. Bennet said, thought proper to make some apology, which was very readily accepted, and so ended the visit.
us cannot however put an end to the chapter without observing that such is the ambitious temper of beauty, that the chapter may always apply to the chapter that celebrated passage in Lucan,  _Nec quenquam jam ferre potest Caesarve priorem, Pompeiusve parem._  Indeed, I believe, it may be laid down as a general rule, that no woman who hath any great pretensions to admiration is ever well pleased in a company where Mrs. Ellison perceives Mrs. Ellison to fill only the second place.
This observation, however, I humbly submit to the judgment of the ladies, and hope This observation will be considered as retracted by me if the ladies shall dissent from my opinion.
