 _In which Booth pays a visit to the noble lord._   When that day of the week returned in which Booth chose to walk abroad, Booth went to wait on the noble peer, according to Booth kind invitation.
Booth now found a very different reception with this great man’s porter from what Booth had met with at Booth friend the colonel’s.
Booth no sooner told Booth name than the porter with a bow told Booth Booth lordship was at home: the door immediately flew wide open, and Booth was conducted to an ante-chamber, where a servant told Booth Booth would acquaint his lordship with Booth arrival.
Nor did Booth wait many minutes before a servant returned and ushered Booth to a servant ’s apartment.
Booth found my lord alone, and was received by Booth in the most courteous manner imaginable.
After the first ceremonials were over, his lordship began in the following words: “Booth, I do assure you, you are very much obliged to my cousin Ellison.
my cousin Ellison hath given you such a character, that I shall have a pleasure in doing anything in my power to serve you.--But it will be very difficult, I am afraid, to get you a rank at home.
In the West Indies, perhaps, or in some regiment abroad, it may be more easy; and, when I consider your reputation as a soldier, I make no doubt of your readiness to go to any place where the service of your country shall call you.” Booth answered, “That Booth was highly obliged to his lordship, and assured Booth Booth would with great chearfulness attend Booth duty in any part of the world.
The only thing grievous in the exchange of countries,” said Booth, “in my opinion, is to leave those I love behind Booth, and I am sure I shall never have a second trial equal to my first.
It was very hard, my lord, to leave a young wife big with her first child, and so affected with my absence, that I had the utmost reason to despair of ever seeing her more.
After such a demonstration of my resolution to sacrifice every other consideration to my duty, I hope his lordship will honour me with some confidence that I shall make no objection to serve in any country.”--“My dear Mr. Booth,” answered my lord, “you speak like a soldier, and I greatly honour your sentiments.
Indeed, I own the justice of your inference from the example you have given; for to quit a wife, as you say, in the very infancy of marriage, is, I acknowledge, some trial of resolution.” Booth answered with a low bow; and then, after some immaterial conversation, Booth promised to speak immediately to the minister, and appointed Mr. Booth to come to the minister again on the Wednesday morning, that the minister might be acquainted with the minister patron’s success.
The poor man now blushed and looked silly, till, after some time, The poor man summoned up all The poor man courage to The poor man assistance, and relying on the other’s friendship, The poor man opened the whole affair of The poor man circumstances, and confessed that The poor man did not dare stir from The poor man lodgings above one day in seven.
The poor man expressed great concern at this account, and very kindly promised to take some opportunity of calling on The poor man at The poor man cousin Ellison’s, when The poor man hoped, The poor man said, to bring The poor man comfortable tidings.
Booth soon afterwards took The poor man leave with the most profuse acknowledgments for so much goodness, and hastened home to acquaint The poor man Amelia with what had so greatly overjoyed The poor man.
his Amelia highly congratulated The poor man on The poor man having found so generous and powerful a friend, towards whom both their bosoms burnt with the warmest sentiments of gratitude.
his Amelia was not, however, contented till his Amelia had made Booth renew The poor man promise, in the most solemn manner, of taking his Amelia with The poor man.
After which they sat down with they little children to a scrag of mutton and broth, with the highest satisfaction, and very heartily drank his lordship’s health in a pot of porter.
In the afternoon this happy couple, if the reader will allow me to call poor people happy, drank tea with Mrs. Ellison, where his lordship’s praises, being again repeated by both the husband and wife, were very loudly echoed by Mrs. Ellison.
While the husband and wife were here, the young lady whom we have mentioned at the end of the last book to have made a fourth at whist, and with whom Amelia seemed so much pleased, came in; Mrs. Ellison was just returned to town from a short visit in the country, and Mrs. Ellison present visit was unexpected.
It was, however, very agreeable to Amelia, who liked Mrs. Ellison still better upon a second interview, and was resolved to solicit Mrs. Ellison further acquaintance.
Mrs. Ellison still maintained some little reserve, but was much more familiar and communicative than before.
Mrs. Ellison appeared, moreover, to be as little ceremonious as Mrs. Ellison had reported Mrs. Ellison, and very readily accepted Amelia’s apology for not paying Mrs. Ellison her present visit, and agreed to drink tea with Mrs. Ellison the very next afternoon.
Whilst the above-mentioned company were sitting in Mrs. Ellison’s parlour, serjeant Atkinson passed by the window and knocked at the door.
Mrs. Ellison no sooner saw Mrs. Ellison than Mrs. Ellison said, “Pray, Mr. Booth, who is that genteel young serjeant?
Mrs. Ellison was here every day last week to enquire after you.” This was indeed a fact; the serjeant was apprehensive of the design of Murphy; but, as the poor fellow had received all the poor fellow answers from the maid of Mrs. Ellison, Booth had never heard a word of the matter.
Booth was, however, greatly pleased with what Booth was now told, and burst forth into great praises of the serjeant, which were seconded by Amelia, who added that Booth was her foster-brother, and, her believed, one of the honestest fellows in the world.
“And I’ll swear,” cries Mrs. Ellison, “Booth is one of the prettiest.
Do, Booth, desire Booth to walk in.
A serjeant of the guards is a gentleman; and I had rather give such a man as you describe a dish of tea than any Beau Fribble of them all.”  Booth wanted no great solicitation to shew any kind of regard to Atkinson; and, accordingly, A serjeant of the guards was ushered in, though not without some reluctance on A serjeant of the guards side.
There is, perhaps, nothing more uneasy than those sensations which the French call the _mauvaise honte,_ nor any more difficult to conquer; and Atkinson Atkinson would, I am persuaded, have mounted a breach with less concern than Atkinson shewed in walking across a room before three ladies, two of whom were Atkinson avowed well-wishers.
Though I do not entirely agree with the late learned Mr. Essex, the celebrated dancing-master’s opinion, that dancing is the rudiment of polite education, as Atkinson would, I apprehend, exclude every other art and science, yet it is certain that persons whose feet have never been under the hands of the professors of that art are apt to discover this want in persons whose feet have never been under the hands of the professors of that art education in every motion, nay, even when persons whose feet have never been under the hands of the professors of that art stand or sit still.
persons whose feet have never been under the hands of the professors of that art seem, indeed, to be overburthened with limbs which persons whose feet have never been under the hands of the professors of that art know not how to use, as if, when Nature hath finished Nature hath work, dancing-master still is necessary to put it in motion.
Atkinson was, at present, an example of this observation which doth so much honour to a profession for which I have a very high regard.
Atkinson was handsome, and exquisitely well made; and yet, as Atkinson had never learnt to dance, Atkinson made so awkward an appearance in Mrs. Ellison’s parlour, that the good lady herself, who had invited Atkinson in, could at first scarce refrain from laughter at Atkinson behaviour.
Atkinson had not, however, been long in the room before admiration of Atkinson person got the better of such risible ideas.
So great is the advantage of beauty in men as well as women, and so sure is this quality in either sex of procuring some regard from the beholder.
The exceeding courteous behaviour of Mrs. Ellison, joined to that of Amelia and Booth, at length dissipated the uneasiness of Atkinson; and Atkinson gained sufficient confidence to tell the company some entertaining stories of accidents that had happened in the army within Atkinson knowledge, which, though the company greatly pleased all present, are not, however, of consequence enough to have a place in this history.
Mrs. Ellison was so very importunate with the company to stay supper that they all consented.
As for the serjeant, Atkinson seemed to be none of the least welcome guests.
Mrs. Ellison was, indeed, so pleased with what Mrs. Ellison had heard of Atkinson, and what Mrs. Ellison saw of Atkinson, that, when a little warmed with wine, for Mrs. Ellison was no flincher at the bottle, Mrs. Ellison began to indulge some freedoms in Mrs. Ellison discourse towards Atkinson that a little offended his Amelia’s delicacy, nay, they did not seem to be highly relished by the other lady; though I am far from insinuating that these exceeded the bounds of decorum, or were, indeed, greater liberties than ladies of the middle age, and especially widows, do frequently allow to especially widows.
