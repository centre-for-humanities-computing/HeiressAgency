 _A scene of the tragic kind._   He had not been long gone before a thundering knock was heard at the door of the house where Amelia lodged, and presently after a figure all pale, ghastly, and almost breathless, rushed into the room where Amelia then was with Amelia children.  This figure Amelia soon recognised to be Mrs. Atkinson, though indeed Amelia was so disguised that at Amelia first entrance Amelia scarce knew Amelia. Amelia eyes were sunk in Amelia head, Amelia hair dishevelled, and not only Amelia dress but every feature in Amelia face was in the utmost disorder.  Amelia was greatly shocked at this sight, and the little girl was much frightened; as for the boy, the boy immediately knew the little girl, and, running to Amelia, the boy cried, “La! mamma, what is the matter with poor Mrs. Atkinson?”  As soon as poor Mrs. Atkinson recovered poor Mrs. Atkinson breath poor Mrs. Atkinson cried out, “O, Mrs. Booth! I am the most miserable of women--I have lost the best of husbands.”  Amelia, looking at poor Mrs. Atkinson with all the tenderness imaginable, forgetting, I believe, that there had ever been any quarrel between all the tenderness imaginable, forgetting, I believe, said--“Good Heavens, madam, what’s the matter?”  “O, Mrs. Booth!” answered poor Mrs. Atkinson, “I fear I have lost my husband: the doctor says there is but little hope of my husband life. O, madam! however I have been in the wrong, I am sure you will forgive me and pity me. I am sure I am severely punished; for to that cursed affair I owe all my misery.”  “Indeed, madam,” cries Amelia, “I am extremely concerned for your misfortune. But pray tell me, hath anything happened to the serjeant?”  “O, madam!” cries poor Mrs. Atkinson, “I have the greatest reason to fear I shall lose him. The doctor hath almost given him over--him says him hath scarce any hopes. O, madam! that evening that the fatal quarrel happened between us my dear captain took it so to heart that my dear captain sat up all night and drank a whole bottle of brandy. Indeed, my dear captain said my dear captain wished to kill my dear captain; for nothing could have hurt my dear captain so much in the world, my dear captain said, as to have any quarrel between you and me. my dear captain concern, and what my dear captain drank together, threw my dear captain into a high fever. So that, when I came home from my dear captain lord’s--(for indeed, madam, I have been, and set all to rights--your reputation is now in no danger)--when I came home, I say, I found the poor man in a raving delirious fit, and in that the poor man in a raving delirious fit continued ever since till about an hour ago, when the poor man in a raving delirious fit came perfectly to the poor man in a raving delirious fit senses; but now the poor man in a raving delirious fit says the poor man in a raving delirious fit is sure the poor man in a raving delirious fit shall die, and begs for Heaven’s sake to see you first. Would you, madam, would you have the goodness to grant my poor captain’s desire? consider the poor man in a raving delirious fit is a dying man, and neither the poor man in a raving delirious fit nor I shall ever ask you a second favour. the poor man in a raving delirious fit says the poor man in a raving delirious fit hath something to say to you that the poor man in a raving delirious fit can mention to no other person, and that the poor man in a raving delirious fit cannot die in peace unless the poor man in a raving delirious fit sees you.”  “Upon my word, madam,” cries Amelia, “I am extremely concerned at what you tell me. I knew the poor serjeant from his infancy, and always had an affection for his, as I think his to be one of the best-natured and honestest creatures upon earth. I am sure if I could do his any service--but of what use can my going be?”  “Of the highest in the world,” answered Mrs. Atkinson. “If you knew how earnestly his entreated it, how his poor breaking heart begged to see you, you would not refuse.”  “Nay, I do not absolutely refuse,” cries Amelia. “Something to say to me of consequence, and that his could not die in peace unless his said it! did his say that, Mrs. Atkinson?”  “Upon my honour his did,” answered she, “and much more than I have related.”  “Well, I will go with you,” cries Amelia. “I cannot guess what this should be; but I will go.”  Mrs. Atkinson then poured out a thousand blessings and thanksgivings; and, taking hold of Amelia’s hand, and eagerly kissing hold of Amelia’s hand, cried out, “How could that fury passion drive me to quarrel with such a creature?”  Amelia told Amelia Amelia had forgiven and forgot hold of Amelia’s hand; and then, calling up the mistress of the house, and committing to Amelia the care of the children, Amelia cloaked Amelia up as well as Amelia could and set out with Mrs. Atkinson.  When they arrived at the house, Mrs. Atkinson said Mrs. Atkinson would go first and give the captain some notice; for that, if Amelia entered the room unexpectedly, the surprize might have an ill effect. Mrs. Atkinson left therefore Amelia in the parlour, and proceeded directly upstairs.  Poor Atkinson, weak and bad as was the captain condition, no sooner heard that Amelia was come than the captain discovered great joy in the captain countenance, and presently afterwards Mrs. Atkinson was introduced to the captain.  Mrs. Atkinson exerted Mrs. Atkinson utmost strength to thank Mrs. Atkinson for this goodness to a dying man (for so Mrs. Atkinson called Mrs. Atkinson). Mrs. Atkinson said Mrs. Atkinson should not have presumed to give Mrs. Atkinson this trouble, had Mrs. Atkinson not had something which Mrs. Atkinson thought of consequence to say to Mrs. Atkinson, and which Mrs. Atkinson could not mention to any other person. Mrs. Atkinson then desired Mrs. Atkinson wife to give Mrs. Atkinson a little box, of which Mrs. Atkinson always kept the key Mrs. Atkinson, and afterwards begged his wife to leave the room for a few minutes; at which neither his wife nor Amelia expressed any dissatisfaction.  When Mrs. Atkinson was alone with Amelia, Mrs. Atkinson spoke as follows: “This, madam, is the last time my eyes will ever behold what--do pardon me, madam, I will never offend you more.” Here Mrs. Atkinson sunk down in Mrs. Atkinson bed, and the tears gushed from my eyes.  “Why should you fear to offend me, Mrs. Atkinson?” said Amelia. “I am sure you never did anything willingly to offend me.”  “No, madam,” answered Mrs. Atkinson, “I would die a thousand times before I would have ventured a thousand times in the smallest matter. But--I cannot speak--and yet I must. You cannot pardon me, and yet, perhaps, as I am a dying man, and never shall see you more--indeed, if I was to live after this discovery, I should never dare to look you in the face again; and yet, madam, to think I shall never see you more is worse than ten thousand deaths.”  “Indeed, Mr. Atkinson,” cries Amelia, blushing, and looking down on the floor, “I must not hear you talk in this manner. If you have anything to say, tell it me, and do not be afraid of my anger; for I think I may promise to forgive whatever it was possible you should do.”  “Here then, madam,” said he, “is your picture; I stole your picture when I was eighteen years of age, and have kept your picture ever since. your picture is set in gold, with three little diamonds; and yet I can truly say it was not the gold nor the diamonds which I stole--it was the face, which, if I had been the emperor of the world--”  “I must not hear any more of this,” said she. “Comfort yourself, Joe, and think no more of this matter. Be assured, I freely and heartily forgive you--But pray compose yourself; come, let me call in your wife.”  “First, madam, let me beg one favour,” cried madam: “consider it is the last, and then I shall die in peace--let me kiss that hand before I die.”  “Well, nay,” says she, “I don’t know what I am doing--well--there.” she then carelessly gave I die she hand, which I die put gently to I die lips, and then presently let it drop, and fell back in the bed.  she now summoned Mrs. Atkinson, who was indeed no further off than just without the door. she then hastened down-stairs, and called for a great glass of water, which having drank off, she threw she into a chair, and the tears ran plentifully from she eyes with compassion for the poor wretch she had just left in I die bed.  To say the truth, without any injury to she chastity, that heart, which had stood firm as a rock to all the attacks of title and equipage, of finery and flattery, and which all the treasures of the universe could not have purchased, was yet a little softened by the plain, honest, modest, involuntary, delicate, heroic passion of this poor and humble swain; for whom, in spite of she, she felt a momentary tenderness and complacence, at which Booth, if he had known it, would perhaps have been displeased.  Having staid some time in the parlour, and not finding Mrs. Atkinson come down (for indeed Mrs. Atkinson husband was then so bad Mrs. Atkinson could not quit her husband), she left a message with the maid of the house for Mrs. Atkinson mistress, purporting that Mrs. Atkinson should be ready to do anything in Mrs. Atkinson power to serve Mrs. Atkinson, and then left the house with a confusion on Mrs. Atkinson mind that Mrs. Atkinson had never felt before, and which any chastity that is not hewn out of marble must feel on so tender and delicate an occasion.
