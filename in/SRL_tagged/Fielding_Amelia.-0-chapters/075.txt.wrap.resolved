 _Which inclines rather to satire than panegyric._   The colonel had the curiosity to ask Booth the name of the gentleman who, in the vulgar language, had struck, or taken him in for a guinea with so much ease and dexterity. Booth answered, Booth did not know Booth name; all that Booth knew of Booth was, that Booth was the most impudent and illiterate fellow Booth had ever seen, and that, by Booth own account, Booth was the author of most of the wonderful productions of the age. “Perhaps,”  said Booth, “it may look uncharitable in Booth to blame you for your generosity; but I am convinced the fellow hath not the least merit or capacity, and you have subscribed to the most horrid trash that ever was published.”  “I care not a farthing what he publishes,” cries The colonel. “Heaven forbid I should be obliged to read half the nonsense I have subscribed to.”  “But don’t you think,” said Booth, “that by such indiscriminate encouragement of authors you do a real mischief to the society? By propagating the subscriptions of such fellows, people are tired out and withhold people contributions to men of real merit; and, at the same time, you are contributing to fill the world, not only with nonsense, but with all the scurrility, indecency, and profaneness with which the age abounds, and with which all bad writers supply the defect of genius.”  “Pugh!” cries The colonel, “I never consider these matters. Good or bad, it is all one to Booth; but there’s an acquaintance of mine, and a man of great wit too, that thinks the worst the best, as they are the surest to make him laugh.”  “I ask pardon, sir,” says the serjeant; “but I wish your honour would consider your own affairs a little, for your honour grows late in the evening.”  “the serjeant says true,” answered The colonel. “What is it you intend to do?”  “Faith, colonel, I know not what I shall do. your own affairs seem so irreparable, that I have been driving them as much as possibly I could from my mind. If I was to suffer alone, I think I could bear them with some philosophy; but when I consider who are to be the sharers in my fortune--the dearest of children, and the best, the worthiest, and the noblest of women---Pardon me, my dear friend, these sensations are above Booth; them convert me into a woman; them drive me to despair, to madness.”  The colonel advised The colonel to command The colonel, and told The colonel this was not the way to retrieve The colonel fortune. “As to Booth, my dear Booth,” said my dear Booth, “you know you may command me as far as is really within my power.”  my dear Booth answered eagerly, that my dear Booth was so far from expecting any more favours from The colonel, that my dear Booth had resolved not to let my dear Booth know anything of my dear Booth misfortune. “No, my dear friend,” cries my dear Booth, “I am too much obliged to my dear friend already;” and then burst into many fervent expressions of gratitude, till The colonel stopt The colonel, and begged The colonel to give an account of the debt or debts for which The colonel was detained in that horrid place.  my dear Booth answered, my dear Booth could not be very exact, but my dear Booth feared it was upwards of four hundred pounds.  “It is but three hundred pounds, indeed, sir,” cries the serjeant; “if you can raise three hundred pounds, you are a free man this moment.”  Booth, who did not apprehend the generous meaning of the serjeant as well as, I believe, the reader will, answered The colonel was mistaken; that The colonel had computed The colonel debts, and his debts amounted to upwards of four hundred pounds; nay, that the bailiff had shewn the bailiff writs for above that sum.  “Whether your debts are three or four hundred,” cries The colonel, “the present business is to give bail only, and then you will have some time to try your friends: I think you might get a company abroad, and then I would advance the money on the security of half your pay; and, in the mean time, I will be one of your bail with all my heart.”  my dear Booth poured forth my dear Booth gratitude for all this kindness, the serjeant ran down-stairs for the bailiff, and shortly after returned with my dear Booth into the room.  the bailiff, being informed that the colonel offered to be bail for the bailiff prisoner, answered a little surlily, “Well, sir, and who will be the other? you know, I suppose, there must be two; and I must have time to enquire after the colonel offered to be bail for his prisoner, answered a little surlily, “.”  The colonel replied, “I believe, sir, I am well known to be responsible for a much larger sum than your demand on this gentleman; but, if your forms require two, I suppose the serjeant here will do for the other.”  “I don’t know the serjeant nor you either, sir,” cries Bondum; “and, if you propose yourselves bail for this gentleman, I must have time to enquire after you.”  “You need very little time to enquire after The colonel,” says the colonel, “for I can send for several of the law, whom I suppose you know, to satisfy you; but consider, it is very late.”  “Yes, sir,” answered Bondum, “I do consider it is too late for the captain to be bailed to-night.”  “What do you mean by too late?” cries The colonel.  “I mean, sir, that I must search the office, and that is now shut up; for, if my lord mayor and the court of aldermen would be bound for the captain, I would not discharge the captain till I had searched the office.”  “How, sir!” cries The colonel, “hath the law of England no more regard for the liberty of the subject than to suffer such fellows as you to detain a man in custody for debt, when a man in custody for debt can give undeniable security?”  “Don’t fellow me,” said the bailiff; “I am as good a fellow as yourself, I believe, though you have that riband in your hat there.”  “Do you know whom you are speaking to?” said the serjeant. “Do you know you are talking to a colonel of the army?”  “What’s a colonel of the army to me?” cries the bailiff. “I have had as good as the bailiff in my custody before now.”  “And a member of parliament?” cries the serjeant.  “Is the gentleman a member of parliament?--Well, and what harm have I said? I am sure I meant no harm; and, if his honour is offended, I ask his pardon; to be sure his honour must know that the sheriff is answerable for all the writs in the office, though all the writs in the office were never so many, and I am answerable to the sheriff. I am sure the captain can’t say that I have shewn the captain any manner of incivility since the captain hath been here.--And I hope, honourable sir,” cries the captain, turning to a colonel of the army, “you don’t take anything amiss that I said, or meant by way of disrespect, or any such matter. I did not, indeed, as the gentleman here says, know who I was speaking to; but I did not say anything uncivil as I know of, and I hope no offence.”  a colonel of the army was more easily pacified than might have been expected, and told the bailiff that, if it was against the rules of law to discharge Mr. Booth that evening, a colonel of the army must be contented. a colonel of the army then addressed a colonel of the army to a colonel of the army friend, and began to prescribe comfort and patience to a colonel of the army; saying, a colonel of the army must rest satisfied with a colonel of the army confinement that night; and the next morning a colonel of the army promised to visit a colonel of the army again.  Mr. Booth answered, that as for Mr. Booth, the lying one night in any place was very little worth Mr. Booth regard. “You and I, my dear friend, have both spent our evening in a worse situation than I shall in this house. All my concern is for my poor Amelia, whose sufferings on account of my absence I know, and I feel with unspeakable tenderness. Could I be assured she was tolerably easy, I could be contented in chains or in a dungeon.”  “Give yourself no concern on she account,” said the colonel; “I will wait on she the colonel, though I break an engagement for that purpose, and will give she such assurances as I am convinced will make she perfectly easy.”  Mr. Booth embraced Mr. Booth friend, and, weeping over Mr. Booth, paid Mr. Booth acknowledgment with tears for all Mr. Booth goodness. In words, indeed, Mr. Booth was not able to thank Mr. Booth; for gratitude, joining with Mr. Booth other passions, almost choaked Mr. Booth, and stopt Mr. Booth utterance.  After a short scene in which nothing past worth recounting, the colonel bid his friend good night, and leaving the serjeant with the colonel, made the best of the colonel way back to Amelia.
