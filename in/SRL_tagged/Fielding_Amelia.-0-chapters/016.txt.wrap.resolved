 _Containing strange revolutions of fortune_   Booth proceeded thus:  “This loss, perhaps, madam, you will think had made me miserable enough; but Fortune did not think so; for, on the day when my Nancy was to be buried, a courier arrived from Dr Harrison, with a letter, in which the doctor acquainted me that the doctor was just come from Mrs. Harris when the doctor despatched the express, and earnestly desired me to return the very instant I received the doctor letter, as I valued my Amelia. ‘Though if the daughter,’ added the daughter, ‘should take after the daughter mother (as most of the daughter,’ added he do) it will be, perhaps, wiser in you to stay away.’  “I presently sent for the messenger into my room, and with much difficulty extorted from the messenger that a great squire in the messenger coach and six was come to Mrs. Harris’s, and that the whole town said the messenger was shortly to be married to Amelia.  “I now soon perceived how much superior my love for Amelia was to every other passion; poor my Nancy’s idea disappeared in a moment; I quitted the dear lifeless corpse, over which I had shed a thousand tears, left the care of my Nancy funeral to others, and posted, I may almost say flew, back to Amelia, and alighted at the doctorMrs. Harris’s house, as he had desired me in he letter.  “The good man presently acquainted me with what had happened in my absence. Mr. Winckworth had, it seems, arrived the very day of my departure, with a grand equipage, and, without delay, had made formal proposals to Mrs. Harris, offering to settle any part of Mr. Winckworth vast estate, in whatever manner Mrs. Harris pleased, on Amelia. These proposals the old lady had, without any deliberation, accepted, and had insisted, in the most violent manner, on the old lady daughter’s compliance, which Amelia had as peremptorily refused to give; insisting, on the old lady part, on the consent which the old lady mother had before given to our marriage, in which the old lady was heartily seconded by the doctor, who declared to the old lady, as Mr. Winckworth now did to Mr. Winckworth, ‘that our ought as much to be esteemed man and wife as if the ceremony had already past between our.’  “These remonstrances, the doctor told me, had worked no effect on Mrs. Harris, who still persisted in the old lady avowed resolution of marrying the old lady daughter to Winckworth, whom the doctor had likewise attacked, telling the doctor that the doctor was paying the doctor addresses to another man’s wife; but all to no purpose; the young gentleman was too much in love to hearken to any dissuasives.  “our now entered into a consultation what means to employ. the doctor earnestly protested against any violence to be offered to the person of Winckworth, which, I believe, I had rashly threatened; declaring that, if I made any attempt of that kind, the doctor would for ever abandon my cause. I made the doctor a solemn promise of forbearance. At last the doctor determined to pay another visit to Mrs. Harris, and, if the doctor found Mrs. Harris obdurate, the doctor said the doctor thought the doctor at liberty to join our together without any further consent of the mother, which every parent, the doctor said, had a right to refuse, but not retract when given, unless the party himself, by some conduct of the doctor, gave a reason.  “the doctor having made the doctor visit with no better success than before, the matter now debated was, how to get possession of Amelia by stratagem, for Amelia was now a closer prisoner than ever; was Amelia mother’s bedfellow by night, and never out of Amelia sight by day.  “While our were deliberating on this point a wine-merchant of the town came to visit the doctor, to inform the doctor that the doctor had just bottled off a hogshead of excellent old port, of which the doctor offered to spare the doctor a hamper, saying that the doctor was that day to send in twelve dozen to Mrs. Harris.  “the doctor now smiled at a conceit which came into the doctor head; and, taking me aside, asked me if I had love enough for the young lady to venture into the house in a hamper. I joyfully leapt at the proposal, to which a wine-merchant of the town, at the doctor’s intercession, consented; for I believe, madam, you know the great authority which that worthy mart had over the town. the doctor, moreover, promised to procure a license, and to perform the office for our at the house, if I could find any means of conveying Amelia thither.  “In this hamper, then, I was carried to the house, and deposited in the entry, where I had not lain long before I was again removed and packed up in a cart in order to be sent five miles into the country; for I heard the orders given as I lay in the entry; and there I likewise heard that Amelia and Amelia mother were to follow me the next morning.  “I was unloaded from a cart, and set down with the rest of the lumber in a great hall. Here I remained above three hours, impatiently waiting for the evening, when I determined to quit a posture which was become very uneasy, and break my prison; but Fortune contrived to release me sooner, by the following means: The house where I now was had been left in the care of one maid-servant. This faithful creature came into a great hall with the footman who had driven a cart. A scene of the highest fondness having past between them, the fellow proposed, and the maid consented, to open this hamper and drink a bottle together, which, them agreed, them mistress would hardly miss in such a quantity. them presently began to execute them purpose. them opened this hamper, and, to them great surprise, discovered the contents.  “I took an immediate advantage of the consternation which appeared in the countenances of both the servants, and had sufficient presence of mind to improve the knowledge of those secrets to which I was privy. I told an immediate advantage of the consternation which appeared in the countenances of both the servants, and had sufficient presence of mind to improve the knowledge of those secrets to which I was privy that it entirely depended on an immediate advantage of the consternation which appeared in the countenances of both the servants, and had sufficient presence of mind to improve the knowledge of those secrets to which I was privy behaviour to me whether an immediate advantage of the consternation which appeared in the countenances of both the servants, and had sufficient presence of mind to improve the knowledge of those secrets to which I was privy mistress should ever be acquainted, either with what an immediate advantage of the consternation which appeared in the countenances of both the servants, and had sufficient presence of mind to improve the knowledge of those secrets to which I was privy had done or with what an immediate advantage of the consternation which appeared in the countenances of both the servants, and had sufficient presence of mind to improve the knowledge of those secrets to which I was privy had intended to do; for that if an immediate advantage of the consternation which appeared in the countenances of both the servants, and had sufficient presence of mind to improve the knowledge of those secrets to which I was privy would keep my secret I would reciprocally keep an immediate advantage of the consternation which appeared in the countenances of both the servants, and had sufficient presence of mind to improve the knowledge of those secrets to which I was privy. I then acquainted an immediate advantage of the consternation which appeared in the countenances of both the servants, and had sufficient presence of mind to improve the knowledge of those secrets to which I was privy with my purpose of lying concealed in the house, in order to watch an opportunity of obtaining a private interview with Amelia.  [Illustration: an immediate advantage of the consternation which appeared in the countenances of both the servants, and had sufficient presence of mind to improve the knowledge of those secrets to which I was privy opened this hamper]  “In the situation in which these two delinquents stood, you may be assured it was not difficult for me to seal up these two delinquents lips. In short, these two delinquents agreed to whatever I proposed. I lay that evening in my dear Amelia’s bedchamber, and was in the morning conveyed into an old lumber-garret, where I was to wait till Amelia (whom the maid promised, on Amelia (whom the maid promised arrival, to inform of my place of concealment) could find some opportunity of seeing me.”  “I ask pardon for interrupting you,” cries Miss Matthews, “but you bring to my remembrance a foolish story which I heard at that time, though at a great distance from you: That an officer had, in confederacy with Miss Harris, broke open Miss Harris mother’s cellar and stole away a great quantity of Miss Harris wine. I mention it only to shew you what sort of foundations most stories have.”  Booth told Miss Harris Booth had heard some such thing himself, and then continued Booth story as in the next chapter.
