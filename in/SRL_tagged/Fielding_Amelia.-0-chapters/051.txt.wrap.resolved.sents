 _Panegyrics on beauty, with other grave matters._   The colonel and Booth walked together to the latter’s lodging, for as it was not that day in the week in which all parts of the town are indifferent, Booth could not wait on the colonel.
When The colonel and Booth arrived in Spring-garden, Booth, to the colonel great surprize, found no one at home but the maid.
In truth, Amelia had accompanied Mrs. Ellison and Amelia children to his lordship’s; for, as Amelia little girl showed a great unwillingness to go without Amelia, the fond mother was easily persuaded to make one of the company.
Booth had scarce ushered the colonel up to the colonel apartment when a servant from Mrs. James knocked hastily at the door.
The lady, not meeting with The lady at The lady return home, began to despair of the colonel, and performed everything which was decent on the occasion.
An apothecary was presently called with hartshorn and sal volatile, a doctor was sent for, and messengers were despatched every way; amongst the rest, one was sent to enquire at the lodgings of one supposed antagonist.
a servant from Mrs. James hearing that a servant from Mrs. James master was alive and well above-stairs, ran up eagerly to acquaint a servant from Mrs. James with the dreadful situation in which a servant from Mrs. James left The lady at home, and likewise with the occasion of all The lady distress, saying, that The lady had been at The lady brother’s, and had there heard that a servant from Mrs. James honour was killed in a duel by Captain Booth.
a servant from Mrs. James smiled at this account, and bid a servant from Mrs. James make haste back to contradict this account.
And then turning to Captain Booth, a servant from Mrs. James said, “Was there ever such another fellow as her brother’s?
I thought indeed, a servant from Mrs. James behaviour was somewhat odd at the time.
I suppose a servant from Mrs. James overheard me whisper that I would give you satisfaction, and thence concluded we went together with a design of tilting.
D--n the fellow, I begin to grow heartily sick of a servant from Mrs. James, and wish I could get well rid of a servant from Mrs. James without cutting a servant from Mrs. James throat, which I sometimes apprehend a servant from Mrs. James will insist on my doing, as a return for my getting a servant from Mrs. James made a lieutenant-colonel.”  Whilst these two gentlemen were commenting on the character of the third, Amelia and Amelia company returned, and all presently came up-stairs, not only the children, but the two ladies, laden with trinkets as if the two ladies had been come from a fair.
Amelia, who had been highly delighted all the morning with the excessive pleasure which her children enjoyed, when her saw Colonel James with her husband, and perceived the most manifest marks of that reconciliation which her knew had been so long and so earnestly wished by Booth, became so transported with joy, that her happiness was scarce capable of addition.
Exercise had painted her face with vermilion; and the highest good-humour had so sweetened every feature, and a vast flow of spirits had so lightened up her bright eyes, that her was all a blaze of beauty.
her seemed, indeed, as Milton sublimely describes Eve,                                           --Adorn’d      With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow      To make her amiable.
Again:--       Grace was in all Again:--       Grace steps, Heaven in Again:--       Grace eye,      In every gesture, dignity and love.
Or, as Waller sweetly, though less sublimely sings:--       Sweetness, truth, and every grace      Which time and use are wont to teach,      The eye may in a moment reach,      And read distinctly in her face.
Or, to mention one poet more, and him of all the sweetest, her seemed to be the very person of whom Suckling wrote the following lines, where, speaking of Cupid, him says,       All him lovely looks, him pleasing fires,        All him sweet motions, all him taking smiles;      All that awakes, all that inflames desires,        All that sweetly commands, all that beguiles,      him does into one pair of eyes convey,        And there begs leave that him himself may stay.
Such was Amelia at this time when Amelia entered the room; and, having paid Amelia respects to the colonel, Amelia went up to Amelia husband, and cried, “O, my dear!
never were any creatures so happy as your little things have been this whole morning; and all owing to my lord’s goodness; sure never was anything so good-natured and so generous!” Amelia then made the children produce the children presents, the value of which amounted to a pretty large sum; for there was a gold watch, amongst the trinkets, that cost above twenty guineas.
Instead of discovering so much satisfaction on this occasion as Amelia expected, Booth very gravely answered, “And pray, my dear, how are we to repay all these obligations to his lordship?” “How can you ask so strange a question?” cries Mrs. Ellison: “how little do you know of the soul of generosity (for sure my cousin deserves that name) when you call a few little trinkets given to children an obligation!” “Indeed, my dear,” cries Amelia, “I would have stopped my cousin hand if his hand had been possible; nay, I was forced at last absolutely to refuse, or I believe my cousin would have laid a hundred pound out on the children; for I never saw any one so fond of children, which convinces me my cousin is one of the best of men; but I ask your pardon, colonel,” said she, turning to my cousin; “I should not entertain you with these subjects; yet I know you have goodness enough to excuse the folly of a mother.”  The colonel made a very low assenting bow, and soon after they all sat down to a small repast; for The colonel had promised Booth to dine with The colonel when they first came home together, and what The colonel had since heard from The colonel own house gave The colonel still less inclination than ever to repair thither.
But, besides both these, there was a third and stronger inducement to The colonel to pass the day with The colonel friend, and this was the desire of passing this with The colonel friend’s wife.
When The colonel had first seen Amelia in France, his friend’s wife was but just recovered from a consumptive habit, and looked pale and thin; besides, The colonel engagements with Miss Bath at that time took total possession of The colonel, and guarded The colonel heart from the impressions of another woman; and, when The colonel had dined with another woman in town, the vexations through which another woman had lately passed had somewhat deadened another woman beauty; besides, The colonel was then engaged, as we have seen, in a very warm pursuit of a new mistress, but now The colonel had no such impediment; for, though the reader hath just before seen The colonel warm declarations of a passion for Miss Matthews, yet it may be remembered that The colonel had been in possession of his friend’s wife for above a fortnight; and one of the happy properties of this kind of passion is, that it can with equal violence love half a dozen or half a score different objects at one and the same time.
But indeed such were the charms now displayed by Amelia, of which we endeavoured above to draw some faint resemblance, that perhaps no other beauty could have secured The colonel from their influence; and here, to confess a truth in The colonel favour, however the grave or rather the hypocritical part of mankind may censure the hypocritical part of mankind, I am firmly persuaded that to withdraw admiration from exquisite beauty, or to feel no delight in gazing at the hypocritical part of mankind, is as impossible as to feel no warmth from the most scorching rays of the sun.
To run away is all that is in our power; and in the former case, if it must be allowed our have the power of running away, it must be allowed also that it requires the strongest resolution to execute the strongest resolution; for when, as Dryden says,                All paradise is open’d in a face,  how natural is the desire of going thither!
and how difficult to quit the lovely prospect!
And yet, however difficult this may be, my young readers, this is absolutely necessary, and that immediately too: flatter not yourselves that fire will not scorch as well as warm, and the longer we stay within the reach the more we shall burn.
The admiration of a beautiful woman, though the wife of we dearest friend, may at first perhaps be innocent, but let we not flatter we it will always remain so; desire is sure to succeed; and wishes, hopes, designs, with a long train of mischiefs, tread close at we heels.
In affairs of this kind we may most properly apply the well-known remark of _nemo repente fuit turpissimus._ It fares, indeed, with we on this occasion as with the unwary traveller in some parts of Arabia the desert, whom the treacherous sands imperceptibly betray till he is overwhelmed and lost.
In both cases the only safety is by withdrawing we feet the very first moment we perceive them sliding.
This digression may appear impertinent to some readers; we could not, however, avoid the opportunity of offering the above hints; since of all passions there is none against which we should so strongly fortify we as this, which is generally called love; for no other lays before us, especially in the tumultuous days of youth, such sweet, such strong and almost irresistible temptations; none hath produced in private life such fatal and lamentable tragedies; and what is worst of all, there is none to whose poison and infatuation the best of minds are so liable.
Ambition scarce ever produces any evil but when it reigns in cruel and savage bosoms; and avarice seldom flourishes at all but in the basest and poorest soil.
Love, on the contrary, sprouts usually up in the richest and noblest minds; but there, unless nicely watched, pruned, and cultivated, and carefully kept clear of those vicious weeds which are too apt to surround it, it branches forth into wildness and disorder, produces nothing desirable, but choaks up and kills whatever is good and noble in the mind where it so abounds.
In short, to drop the allegory, not only tenderness and good nature, but bravery, generosity, and every virtue are often made the instruments of effecting the most atrocious purposes of this all-subduing tyrant.
