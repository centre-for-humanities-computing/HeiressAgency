 _The heroic behaviour of Colonel Bath._   Booth went this morning to pay a second visit to the colonel, where Booth found Colonel James.
Both the colonel, where he found Colonel James appeared a little shocked at the colonel, where he found Colonel James first meeting, but matters were soon cleared up; for the former presently advanced to the latter, shook Booth heartily by the hand, and said, “Booth, I am ashamed to see you; for I have injured you, and I heartily ask your pardon.
I am now perfectly convinced that what I hinted to my brother, and which I find had like to have produced such fatal consequences, was entirely groundless.
If you will be contented with my asking your pardon, and spare me the disagreeable remembrance of what led me into my error, I shall esteem it as the highest obligation.”  Booth answered, “As to what regards yourself, my dear colonel, I am abundantly satisfied; but, as I am convinced some rascal hath been my enemy with yourself in the cruellest manner, I hope you will not deny me the opportunity of kicking Booth through the world.”  “By all the dignity of man,” cries Colonel Bath, “the boy speaks with spirit, and the boy request is reasonable.”  Colonel James hesitated a moment, and then whispered Booth that Colonel James would give Colonel James all the satisfaction imaginable concerning the whole affair when both were alone together; upon which, Booth addressing Colonel James to Colonel Bath, the discourse turned on other matters during the remainder of the visit, which was but short, and then both went away together, leaving Colonel Bath as well as it was possible to expect, more to the satisfaction of Booth than of Colonel James, who would not have been displeased if Colonel James wound had been more dangerous; for Colonel James was grown somewhat weary of a disposition that Colonel James rather called captious than heroic, and which, as Colonel James every day more and more hated Colonel James wife, Colonel James apprehended might some time or other give Colonel James some trouble; for Colonel Bath was the most affectionate of brothers, and had often swore, in the presence of James, that Colonel James would eat any man alive who should use Colonel James sister ill.
Colonel Bath was well satisfied that Colonel Bath brother and the lieutenant were gone out with a design of tilting, from which Colonel Bath offered not a syllable to dissuade his brother and the lieutenant, as Colonel Bath was convinced it was right, and that Booth could not in honour take, nor Colonel Bath give, any less satisfaction.
When his brother and the lieutenant had been gone therefore about half an hour, Colonel Bath rang Colonel Bath bell to enquire if there was any news of Colonel Bath brother; a question which Colonel Bath repeated every ten minutes for the space of two hours, when, having heard nothing of Colonel Bath, Colonel Bath began to conclude that both were killed on the spot.
While Colonel Bath was in this state of anxiety his sister came to see Colonel Bath; for, notwithstanding Colonel Bath desire of keeping it a secret, the duel had blazed all over the town.
After receiving some kind congratulations on Colonel Bath safety, and some unkind hints concerning the warmth of Colonel Bath temper, Colonel Bath asked his sister when his sister had seen his sister husband?
his sister answered not that morning.
Colonel Bath then communicated to his sister Colonel Bath suspicion, told his sister Colonel Bath was convinced his brother had drawn Colonel Bath sword that day, and that, as neither of them had heard anything from his brother, his brother began to apprehend the worst that could happen.
Neither Miss Bellamy nor Mrs. Gibber were ever in a greater consternation on the stage than now appeared in the countenance of Mrs. James.
“Good Heavens!
his brother,” cries Mrs. James; “what do you tell me?
you have frightened me to death.
Let your man get me a glass of water immediately, if you have not a mind to see me die before your face.
When, where, how was this quarrel?
why did you not prevent it if you knew of it?
is it not enough to be every day tormenting me with hazarding your own life, but must you bring the life of one who you know must be, and ought to be, so much the dearest of all to me, into danger?
take his sword, brother, take his sword, and plunge his sword into my bosom; it would be kinder of brother than to fill his sword with such dreads and terrors.”  Here Mrs. James swallowed the glass of water, and then threw Mrs. James back in Mrs. James chair, as if Mrs. James had intended to faint away.
Perhaps, if Mrs. James had so, the colonel would have lent Mrs. James no assistance, for Mrs. James had hurt the colonel more than by ten thousand stabs.
the colonel sat erect in the colonel , with the colonel eyebrows knit, the colonel forehead wrinkled, the colonel eyes flashing fire, the colonel teeth grating against each other, and breathing horrour all round the colonel.
In this posture the colonel sat for some time silent, casting disdainful looks at “Sister.
At last the colonel voice found his voice way through a passion which had almost choaked the colonel, and the colonel cried out, “Sister, what have I done to deserve the opinion you express of the colonel?
which of my actions hath made you conclude that I am a rascal and a coward?
look at that poor sword, which never woman yet saw but in his voice sheath; what hath that done to merit your desire that his voice should be contaminated with the blood of a woman?”  “Alas!
brother,” cried “Sister, “I know not what you say; you are desirous, I believe, to terrify me out of the little senses I have left.
What can I have said, in the agonies of grief into which you threw me, to deserve this passion?”  “What have you said?” answered the colonel: “you have said that which, if a man had spoken, nay, d--n me, if a man had but hinted that a man durst even think, I would have made a man eat my sword; by all the dignity of man, I would have crumbled a man soul into powder.
But I consider that the words were spoken by a woman, and I am calm again.
Consider, my dear, that you are my sister, and behave yourself with more spirit.
I have only mentioned to yourself my surmise.
It may not have happened as I suspect; but, let what will have happened, you will have the comfort that your husband hath behaved I suspect with becoming dignity, and lies in the bed of honour.”  “Talk not to me of such comfort,” replied the lady; “it is a loss I cannot survive.
But why do I sit here lamenting yourself?
I will go this instant and know the worst of my fate, if my trembling limbs will carry me to my coach.
Good morrow, dear brother; whatever becomes of yourself, I am glad to find you out of danger.” The colonel paid the lady The colonel proper compliments, and the lady then left the room, but returned instantly back, saying, “yourself, I must beg the favour of yourself to let your footman step to my mantua-maker; I am sure it is a miracle, in my present distracted condition, how a miracle came into my head.” your footman was presently summoned, and Mrs. James delivered your footman your footman message, which was to countermand the orders which Mrs. James had given that very morning to make Mrs. James up a new suit of brocade.
“Heaven knows,” says Mrs. James, “now when I can wear brocade, or whether ever I shall wear it.” And now, having repeated Mrs. James message with great exactness, lest there should be any mistake, Mrs. James again lamented Mrs. James wretched situation, and then departed, leaving The colonel in full expectation of hearing speedy news of the fatal issue of the battle.
But, though the reader should entertain the same curiosity, we must be excused from satisfying it till we have first accounted for an incident which we have related in this very chapter, and which, we think, deserves some solution.
The critic, I am convinced, already is apprized that I mean the friendly behaviour of Mrs. James to Booth, which, from what we had before recorded, seemed so little to be expected.
It must be remembered that the anger which the former of these gentlemen had conceived against the latter arose entirely from the false account given by Miss Matthews of Booth, whom that lady had accused to Colonel James of having as basely as wickedly traduced Colonel James character.
Now, of all the ministers of vengeance, there are none with whom the devil deals so treacherously as with those whom he employs in executing the mischievous purposes of an angry mistress; for no sooner is revenge executed on an offending lover that it is sure to be repented; and all the anger which before raged against the beloved object, returns with double fury on the head of he assassin.
Miss Matthews, therefore, no, sooner heard that Booth was killed (for so was the report at first, and by a colonel of the army) than Miss Matthews immediately concluded it to be James.
Miss Matthews was extremely shocked with the news, and Miss Matthews heart instantly began to relent.
All the reasons on which Miss Matthews had founded Miss Matthews love recurred, in the strongest and liveliest colours, to Miss Matthews mind, and all the causes of Miss Matthews hatred sunk down and disappeared; or, if the least remembrance of anything which had disobliged Miss Matthews remained, her heart became his zealous advocate, and soon satisfied Miss Matthews that Miss Matthews own fates were more to be blamed than his, and that, without being a villain, his could have acted no otherwise than his had done.
In this temper of mind Miss Matthews looked on Miss Matthews as the murderer of an innocent man, and, what to Miss Matthews was much worse, of the man Miss Matthews had loved, and still did love, with all the violence imaginable.
Miss Matthews looked on Colonel James as the tool with which Miss Matthews had done this murder; and, as it is usual for people who have rashly or inadvertently made any animate or inanimate thing the instrument of mischief to hate the innocent means by which the mischief was effected (for this is a subtle method which the mind invents to excuse ourselves, the last objects on whom ourselves would willingly wreak ourselves vengeance), so Miss Matthews now hated and cursed Colonel James as the efficient cause of that act which Miss Matthews herself had contrived and laboured to carry into execution.
Miss Matthews sat down therefore in a furious agitation, little short of madness, and wrote the following letter:  “I Hope this will find you in the hands of justice, for the murder of one of the best friends that ever man was blest with.
In one sense, indeed, ever man may seem to have deserved ever man , by chusing a fool for a friend; for who but a fool would have believed what the anger and rage of an injured woman suggested; a story so improbable, that I could scarce be thought in earnest when I mentioned it?
“Know, then, cruel wretch, that Booth Booth loved you of all men breathing, and was, I believe, in your commendation guilty of as much falsehood as I was in what I told you concerning Booth.
“If this knowledge makes you miserable, this knowledge is no more than you have made the unhappy F. MATTHEWS.”
