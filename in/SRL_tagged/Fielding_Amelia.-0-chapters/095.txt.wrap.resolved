 _Read, gamester, and observe_.   Booth could not so well disguise the agitations of Booth mind from Amelia, but that Booth perceived sufficient symptoms to assure Booth that some misfortune had befallen Booth. This made Booth in Booth turn so uneasy that Booth took notice of it, and after breakfast said, “Sure, my dear Emily, something hath fallen out to vex you.”  Amelia, looking tenderly at ”  , answered, “Indeed, my dear, you are in the right; I am indeed extremely vexed.” “For Heaven’s sake,” said he, “what is it?” “Nay, my love,” cried Amelia, “that you must answer Amelia. Whatever it is which hath given you all that disturbance that you in vain endeavour to conceal from me, this this is which causes all my affliction.”  “You guess truly, my sweet,” replied Booth; “I am indeed afflicted, and I will not, nay I cannot, conceal the truth from my dear Emily. I have undone me, Amelia.”  “What have you done, child?” said child, in some consternation; “pray, tell me.”  “I have lost my money at play,” answered ”  .  “Pugh!” said child, recovering herself--“what signifies the trifle you had in your pocket? Resolve never to play again, and let it give you no further vexation; I warrant you, we will contrive some method to repair such a loss.”  “Thou heavenly angel! thou comfort of my soul!” cried Booth, tenderly embracing child; then starting a little from child arms, and looking with eager fondness in child eyes, ”   said, “Let me survey thee; art thou really human, or art thou not rather an angel in a human form? O, no,”  cried ”  , flying again into her arms, “thou art my dearest woman, my best, my beloved wife!”  Amelia, having returned all his caresses with equal kindness, told his Amelia had near eleven guineas in Amelia purse, and asked how much Amelia should fetch his. “I would not advise you, Billy, to carry too much in your pocket, for fear it should be a temptation to Billy to return to gaming, in order to retrieve your past losses. Let me beg you, on all accounts, never to think more, if possible, on the trifle you have lost, anymore than if you had never possessed it.”  Booth promised Amelia faithfully Booth never would, and refused to take any of the money. Booth then hesitated a moment, and Booth say, my dear, you have eleven guineas; you have a diamond ring, likewise, which was your grandmother’s--I believe that is worth twenty pounds; and your own and the child’s watch are worth as much more.”  “I believe they would sell for as much,” cried Amelia; “for a pawnbroker of Mrs. Atkinson’s acquaintance offered to lend me thirty-five pounds upon they when you was in your last distress. But why are you computing they value now?”  “I was only considering,” answered Booth, “how much we could raise in any case of exigency.”  “I have computed it myself,” said she; “and I believe all we have in the world, besides we bare necessary apparel, would produce about sixty pounds: and suppose, my dear,” said she, “while we have that little sum, we should think of employing it some way or other, to procure some small subsistence for we and we family. As for your dependence on the colonel’s friendship, it is all vain, I am afraid, and fallacious. Nor do I see any hopes you have from any other quarter, of providing for yourself again in the army. And though the sum which is now in our power is very small, yet our may possibly contrive with the sum which is now in our power is very small to put our into some mean way of livelihood. I have a heart, my Billy, which is capable of undergoing anything for your sake; and I hope my hands are as able to work as those which have been more inured to the sum which is now in our power is very small. But think, my dear, think what must be our wretched condition, when the very little our now have is all mouldered away, as it will soon be in this town.”  When poor Booth heard this, and reflected that the time which Amelia foresaw was already arrived (for that Booth had already lost every farthing poor Booth were worth), it touched Booth to the quick; Booth turned pale, gnashed Booth teeth, and cried out, “Damnation! this is too much to bear.”  Amelia was thrown into the utmost consternation by this behaviour; and, with great terror in Amelia countenance, cried out, “Good Heavens! my dear love, what is the reason of this agony?”  “Ask me no questions,” cried he, “unless you would drive me to madness.”  “My Billy! my dear love!” said Amelia, “what can be the meaning of this?--I beg you will deal openly with Amelia, and tell me all your griefs.”  “Have you dealt fairly with Amelia, Amelia?” said Amelia.  “Yes, surely,” said Amelia; “Heaven is my witness how fairly.”  “Nay, do not call Heaven,” cried he, “to witness a falsehood. You have not dealt openly with Amelia, Amelia. You have concealed secrets from Amelia; secrets which I ought to have known, and which, if I had known, it had been better for us both.”  “You astonish me as much as you shock me,” cried Amelia. “What falsehood, what treachery have I been guilty of?”  “You tell me,” said he, “that I can have no reliance on James; why did not you tell me so before?”  “I call Heaven again,” said she, “to witness; nay, I appeal to she for the truth of it; I have often told you so. I have told you I disliked she, notwithstanding the many favours she had done you. I desired you not to have too absolute a reliance upon she. I own I had once an extreme good opinion of she, but I changed an extreme good opinion of him, and I acquainted you that I had so--”  “But not,” cries she, “with the reasons why you had changed it.”  “I was really afraid, my dear,” said my dear, “of going too far. I knew the obligations you had to she; and if I suspected that she acted rather from vanity than true friendship--”  “Vanity!” cries she; “take care, Amelia: you know she motive to be much worse than vanity--a motive which, if she had piled obligations on me till they had reached the skies, would tumble all down to hell. It is vain to conceal It longer--I know all--your confidant hath told me all.”  “Nay, then,” cries my dear, “on my knees I entreat you to be pacified, and hear me out. It was, my dear, for my dear, my dread of your jealous honour, and the fatal consequences.”  “Is not Amelia, then,” cried she, “equally jealous of your jealous honour? Would my dear, from a weak tenderness for my person, go privately about to betray, to undermine the most invaluable treasure of my soul? Would my dear have me pointed at as the credulous dupe, the easy fool, the tame, the kind cuckold, of a rascal with whom I conversed as a friend?”  “Indeed you injure me,” said Amelia. “Heaven forbid I should have the trial! but I think I could sacrifice all I hold most dear to preserve your jealous honour. I think I have shewn I can. But I will--when you are cool, I will--satisfy you I have done nothing you ought to blame.”  “I am cool then,” cries he; “I will with the greatest coolness hear you.--But do not think, Amelia, I have the least jealousy, the least suspicion, the least doubt of your jealous honour. It is your want of confidence in me alone which I blame.”  “When you are calm,” cried Amelia, “I will speak, and not before.”  he assured Amelia he was calm; and then Amelia said, “You have justified my conduct by your present passion, in concealing from you my suspicions; for they were no more, nay, it is possible they were unjust; for since the doctor, in betraying the secret to you, hath so far falsified my opinion of he, why may I not be as well deceived in my opinion of the colonel, since it was only formed on some particulars in he behaviour which I disliked? for, upon my honour, he never spoke a word to Amelia, nor hath been ever guilty of any direct action, which I could blame.”  Amelia then went on, and related most of the circumstances which Amelia had mentioned to the doctor, omitting one or two of the strongest, and giving such a turn to the rest, that, if Booth had not had some of Othello’s blood in Booth, Booth wife would have almost appeared a prude in Booth eyes. Even Booth, however, was pretty well pacified by this narrative, and said Booth was glad to find a possibility of the colonel’s innocence; but that Booth greatly commended the prudence of his wife, and only wished his wife would for the future make Booth her only confidant.  Amelia, upon that, expressed some bitterness against the doctor for breaking the doctor trust; when Booth, in the doctor excuse, related all the circumstances of the letter, and plainly convinced Amelia that the secret had dropt by mere accident from the mouth of the doctor.  Thus the husband and wife became again reconciled, and Amelia generously forgave a passion of which the sagacious reader is better acquainted with the real cause than was that unhappy lady.
