 _In which Amelia appears in no unamiable light._   Amelia, with the assistance of a little girl, who was their only servant, had drest her dinner, and her had likewise drest her as neat as any lady who had a regular sett of servants could have done, when Booth returned, and brought with Booth Booth friend James, whom Booth had met with in the Park; and who, as Booth absolutely refused to dine away from Booth wife, to whom Booth had promised to return, had invited Booth to dine with Booth. her had none of that paultry pride which possesses so many of her sex, and which disconcerts their tempers, and gives their the air and looks of furies, if their husbands bring in an unexpected guest, without giving their husbands timely warning to provide a sacrifice to their husbands own vanity. her received Booth’s friend with the utmost complaisance and good humour: her made indeed some apology for the homeliness of her dinner; but it was politely turned as a compliment to Mr. James’s friendship, which could carry Booth where Booth was sure of being so ill entertained; and gave not the least hint how magnificently her would have provided _had her expected the favour of so much good company._ A phrase which is generally meant to contain not only an apology for the lady of the house, but a tacit satire on her guests for her guests intrusion, and is at least a strong insinuation that her guests are not welcome.  her failed not to enquire very earnestly after her old friend Mrs. James, formerly Miss Bath, and was very sorry to find that her was not in town. The truth was, as James had married out of a violent liking of, or appetite to, her person, possession had surfeited him, and him was now grown so heartily tired of him wife, that her had very little of him company; her was forced therefore to content her with being the mistress of a large house and equipage in the country ten months in the year by her. The other two him indulged her with the diversions of the town; but then, though they lodged under the same roof, her had little more of her husband’s society than if they had been one hundred miles apart. With all this, as her was a woman of calm passions, her made her contented; for her had never had any violent affection for James: the match was of the prudent kind, and to her advantage; for James fortune, by the death of an uncle, was become very considerable; and her had gained everything by the bargain but a husband, which her constitution suffered her to be very well satisfied without.  When her, after dinner, retired to her children, James began to talk to James friend concerning James affairs. James advised Booth very earnestly to think of getting again into the army, in which James himself had met with such success, that he himself had obtained the command of a regiment to which he himself brother-in-law was lieutenant-colonel. These preferments they both owed to the favour of fortune only; for, though there was no objection to either of they military characters, yet neither of they had any extraordinary desert; and, if merit in the service was a sufficient recommendation, Booth, who had been twice wounded in the siege, seemed to have the fairest pretensions; but James remained a poor half-pay lieutenant, and the others were, as we have said, one of the others a lieutenant-colonel, and the other had a regiment. Such rises we often see in life, without being able to give any satisfactory account of the means, and therefore ascribe the others to the good fortune of the person.  Both Colonel James and Both Colonel James brother-in-law were members of parliament; for, as the uncle of the former had left brother-in-law, together with brother-in-law estate, an almost certain interest in a borough, so brother-in-law chose to confer this favour on Colonel Bath; a circumstance which would have been highly immaterial to mention here, but as this favour serves to set forth the goodness of James, who endeavoured to make up in kindness to the family what brother-in-law wanted in fondness for brother-in-law wife.  Both Colonel James then endeavoured all in Both Colonel James power to persuade Booth to think again of a military life, and very kindly offered Both Colonel James Both Colonel James interest towards obtaining Both Colonel James a company in the regiment under Both Colonel James command. Booth must have been a madman, in Booth present circumstances, to have hesitated one moment at accepting such an offer, and Booth well knew Amelia, notwithstanding Amelia aversion to the army, was much too wise to make the least scruple of giving Amelia consent. Nor was Booth, as it appeared afterwards, mistaken in Booth opinion of Booth wife’s understanding; for his wife’s understanding made not the least objection when not the least objection was communicated to his wife’s understanding, but contented his wife’s understanding with an express stipulation, that wherever Booth was commanded to go (for the regiment was now abroad) his wife’s understanding would accompany Booth.  Booth, therefore, accepted Booth friend’s proposal with a profusion of acknowledgments; and it was agreed that Booth should draw up a memorial of Booth pretensions, which Colonel James undertook to present to some man of power, and to back it with all the force Booth had.  Nor did the friendship of the colonel stop here. “You will excuse me, Booth,” said Booth, “if, after what you have told me” (for Booth had been very explicit in revealing Booth affairs to Booth), “I suspect you must want money at this time. If that be the case, as I am certain that be the case must be, I have fifty pieces at your service.” This generosity brought the tears into Booth’s eyes; and he at length confest that he had not five guineas in the house; upon which Colonel James gave Colonel James a bank-bill for twenty pounds, and said Colonel James would give Colonel James thirty more the next time Colonel James saw Colonel James.  Thus did Colonel James (for generous Colonel James really was to the highest degree) restore peace and comfort to this little family; and by this act of beneficence make two of the worthiest people two of the happiest that evening.  Here, reader, give me leave to stop a minute, to lament that so few are to be found of this benign disposition; that, while wantonness, vanity, avarice, and ambition are every day rioting and triumphing in the follies and weakness, the ruin and desolation of mankind, scarce one man in a thousand is capable of tasting the happiness of others. Nay, give me leave to wonder that pride, which is constantly struggling, and often imposing on itself, to gain some little pre-eminence, should so seldom hint to us the only certain as well as laudable way of setting us above another man, and that is, by becoming his benefactor.
