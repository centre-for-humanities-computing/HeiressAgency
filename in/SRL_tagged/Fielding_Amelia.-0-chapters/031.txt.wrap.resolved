 _In which Mr. Booth relates Mr. Booth return to England._   “Nothing remarkable, as I remember, happened during our stay at Paris, which our left soon after and came to London. Here our rested only two days, and then, taking leave of our fellow-travellers, our set out for Wiltshire, my wife being so impatient to see the child which my wife had left behind my wife, that the child my wife carried with my wife was almost killed with the fatigue of the journey.  “our arrived at our inn late in the evening. my wife, though my wife had no great reason to be pleased with any part of my wife sister’s behaviour, resolved to behave to my wife as if nothing wrong had ever happened. my wife therefore sent a kind note to my wife the moment of our arrival, giving my wife my wife option, whether my wife would come to our at our inn, or whether our should that evening wait on my wife. The servant, after waiting an hour, brought our an answer, excusing my wife from coming to our so late, as my wife was disordered with a cold, and desiring my wife by no means to think of venturing out after the fatigue of my wife journey; saying, my wife would, on that account, defer the great pleasure of seeing my wife till the morning, without taking any more notice of your humble servant than if no such person had been in the world, though I had very civilly sent my compliments to my wife. I should not mention this trifle, if it was not to shew you the nature of the woman, and that it will be a kind of key to my wife future conduct.  “When The servant returned, the good doctor, who had been with our almost all the time of The servant absence, hurried our away to The servant house, where our presently found a supper and a bed prepared for our. my wife was eagerly desirous to see my wife child that night; but the doctor would not suffer the doctor; and, as the doctor was at nurse at a distant part of the town, and the doctor assured my wife the doctor had seen the doctor in perfect health that evening, my wife suffered my wife at last to be dissuaded.  “our spent that evening in the most agreeable manner; for the doctor’s wit and humour, joined to the highest chearfulness and good nature, made the doctor the most agreeable companion in the world: and the doctor was now in the highest spirits, which the doctor was pleased to place to our account. our sat together to a very late hour; for so excellent is my wife constitution, that my wife declared my wife was scarce sensible of any fatigue from my wife late journeys.  “my wife slept not a wink all night, and in the morning early the doctor accompanied our to the little infant. The transports our felt on this occasion were really enchanting, nor can any but a fond parent conceive, I am certain, the least idea of a fond parent conceive. our imaginations suggested a hundred agreeable circumstances, none of which had, perhaps, any foundation. our made words and meaning out of every sound, and in every feature found out some resemblance to my Amelia, as my Amelia did to me.  “But I ask your pardon for dwelling on such incidents, and will proceed to scenes which, to most persons, will be more entertaining.  “our went hence to pay a visit to Miss Harris, whose reception of our was, I think, truly ridiculous; and, as you know the lady, I will endeavour to describe it particularly. At our first arrival our were ushered into a parlour, where our were suffered to wait almost an hour. At length the lady of the house appeared in deep mourning, with a face, if possible, more dismal than the lady dress, in which, however, there was every appearance of art. the lady features were indeed skrewed up to the very height of grief. With this face, and in the most solemn gait, the lady approached my Amelia, and coldly saluted the lady. After which the lady made me a very distant formal courtesy, and we all sat down. A short silence now ensued, which Miss Harris at length broke with a deep sigh, and said, ‘Sister, here is a great alteration in this place since you saw it last; Heaven hath been pleased to take my poor mother to itself.’--(Here my poor mother wiped my poor mother eyes, and then continued.)--‘I hope I know my duty, and have learned a proper resignation to the divine will; but something is to be allowed to grief for the best of mothers; for so my poor mother was to us both; and if at last my poor mother made any distinction, my poor mother must have had my poor mother reasons for so doing. I am sure I can truly say I never wished, much less desired it.’ The tears now stood in poor my Amelia’s eyes; indeed, my poor mother had paid too many already for the memory of so unnatural a parent. my poor mother answered, with the sweetness of an angel, that my poor mother was far from blaming my poor mother sister’s emotions on so tender an occasion; that my poor mother heartily joined with my poor mother in my poor mother grief; for that nothing which my poor mother mother had done in the latter part of her mother life could efface the remembrance of that tenderness which my poor mother had formerly shewn my poor mother. her sister caught hold of the word efface, and rung the changes upon it.--‘Efface!’ cried her sister, ‘O Miss Emily (for you must not expect me to repeat names that will be for ever odious), I wish indeed everything could be effaced.--Effaced! O that that was possible! we might then have still enjoyed my poor mother; for I am convinced her sister never recovered her grief on a certain occasion.’--Thus her sister ran on, and, after many bitter strokes upon her sister, at last directly charged her mother’s death on my marriage with Amelia. I could be silent then no longer. I reminded her sister of the perfect reconciliation between we before my departure, and the great fondness which her sister expressed for me; nor could I help saying, in very plain terms, that if her sister had ever changed her sister opinion of me, as I was not conscious of having deserved such a change by my own behaviour, I was well convinced to whose good offices I owed it. Guilt hath very quick ears to an accusation. Miss Harris immediately answered to the charge. Miss Harris said, such suspicions were no more than Miss Harris expected; that such suspicions were of a piece with every other part of my conduct, and gave Miss Harris one consolation, that such suspicions served to account for Miss Harris Emily’s unkindness, as well to Miss Harris as to Miss Harris poor deceased mother, and in some measure lessened the guilt of some measure with regard to Miss Harris, since some measure was not easy to know how far a woman is in the power of a woman husband. My dear Amelia reddened at this reflection on My dear Amelia, and begged a woman to name any single instance of unkindness or disrespect in which her sister had ever offended. To this the other answered (I am sure I repeat her sister words, though I cannot mimic either the voice or air with which they were spoken)--‘Pray, Miss Emily, which is to be the judge, yourself or that gentleman? I remember the time when I could have trusted to your judgment in any affair; but you are now no longer mistress of yourself, and are not answerable for your actions. Indeed, it is my constant prayer that your actions may not be imputed to yourself. It was the constant prayer of that blessed woman, my dear mother, who is now a saint above; a saint whose name I can never mention without a tear, though I find you can hear a tear without one. I cannot help observing some concern on so melancholy an occasion; it seems due to decency; but, perhaps (for I always wish to excuse you) you are forbid to cry.’ The idea of being bid or forbid to cry struck so strongly on my fancy, that indignation only could have prevented me from laughing. But my narrative, I am afraid, begins to grow tedious. In short, after hearing, for near an hour, every malicious insinuation which a fertile genius could invent, we took we leave, and separated as persons who would never willingly meet again.  “The next morning after this interview Amelia received a long letter from Miss Harris; in which, after many bitter invectives against me, Amelia excused Amelia mother, alledging that Amelia had been driven to do as Amelia did in order to prevent Amelia’s ruin, if Amelia fortune had fallen into my hands. Amelia likewise very remotely hinted that Amelia would be only a trustee for Amelia sister’s children, and told Amelia that on one condition only Amelia would consent to live with Amelia as a sister. This was, if Amelia could by any means be separated from that man, as Amelia was pleased to call me, who had caused so much mischief in the family.  “I was so enraged at this usage, that, had not my wife intervened, I believe I should have applied to a magistrate for a search-warrant for that picture, which there was so much reason to suspect Amelia had stolen; and which I am convinced, upon a search, we should have found in Amelia possession.”  “Nay, it is possible enough,” cries Miss Matthews; “for I believe there is no wickedness of which the lady is not capable.”  “a long letter was succeeded by another of the like comfortable kind, which informed me that the company in which I was, being an additional one raised in the beginning of the war, was reduced; so that I was now a lieutenant on half-pay.  “Whilst we were meditating on we present situation the good doctor came to we. When we related to the good doctor the manner in which her sister had treated we, the good doctor cried out, ‘Poor soul! I pity her sister heartily;’ for this is the severest resentment the good doctor ever expresses; indeed, I have often heard the good doctor say that a wicked soul is the greatest object of compassion in the world.”--A sentiment which we shall leave the reader a little time to digest.
