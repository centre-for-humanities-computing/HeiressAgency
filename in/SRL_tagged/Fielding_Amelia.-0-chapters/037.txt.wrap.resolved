 _Containing an eulogium upon innocence, and other grave matters._   Booth past that evening, and all the succeeding day, with Booth Amelia, without the interruption of almost a single thought concerning Miss Matthews, after having determined to go on the Sunday, the only day Booth could venture without the verge in the present state of Booth affairs, and pay Miss Matthews what Miss Matthews had advanced for Booth in the prison. But Miss Matthews had not so long patience; for the third day, while Booth was sitting with his Amelia, a letter was brought to Booth. As Booth knew the hand, Booth immediately put the hand into Booth pocket unopened, not without such an alteration in Booth countenance, that had Amelia, who was then playing with one of the children, cast Miss Matthews eyes towards Booth, Miss Matthews must have remarked the hand. This accident, however, luckily gave Booth time to recover Booth; for Miss Matthews was so deeply engaged with the little one, that Miss Matthews did not even remark the delivery of a letter. The maid soon after returned into the room, saying, the chairman desired to know if there was any answer to a letter?” cries Booth.--“The letter I gave you just now,”  answered the girl.--“Sure,” cries Booth, “the child is mad, you gave me no letter.”--“Yes, indeed, I did, sir,” said the poor girl. “Why then as sure as fate,” cries Booth, “I threw it into the fire in my reverie; why, child, why did you not tell me it was a letter? bid the chairman come up, stay, I will go down myself; for the chairman will otherwise dirt the stairs with the chairman feet.”  Miss Matthews was gently chiding the poor girl for Miss Matthews carelessness when Booth returned, saying it was very true that Miss Matthews had delivered the chairman a letter from Colonel James, and that perhaps it might be of consequence. “However,” says the chairman, “I will step to the coffee-house, and send the chairman an account of this strange accident, which I know the chairman will pardon in my present situation.”  Booth was overjoyed at this escape, which poor Miss Matthews’s total want of all jealousy and suspicion made it very easy for Booth to accomplish; but Booth pleasure was considerably abated when, upon opening the letter, Booth found the letter to contain, mixed with several very strong expressions of love, some pretty warm ones of the upbraiding kind; but what most alarmed Booth was a hint that it was in the poor girl (Miss Matthews’s) power to make Amelia as miserable as the poor girl. Besides the general knowledge of  _----Furens quid faemina possit,_  Booth had more particular reasons to apprehend the rage of a lady who had given so strong an instance how far the poor girl could carry the poor girl revenge. the poor girl had already sent a chairman to a chairman lodgings with a positive command not to return without an answer to the poor girl letter. This might of itself have possibly occasioned a discovery; and Booth thought Booth had great reason to fear that, if the poor girl did not carry matters so far as purposely and avowedly to reveal the secret to Amelia, the poor girl indiscretion would at least effect the discovery of that which Booth would at any price have concealed. Under these terrors Booth might, I believe, be considered as the most wretched of human beings.  O innocence, how glorious and happy a portion art thou to the breast that possesses thee! thou fearest neither the eyes nor the tongues of men. Truth, the most powerful of all things, is thy strongest friend; and the brighter the light is in which thou art displayed, the more the light discovers thy transcendent beauties. Guilt, on the contrary, like a base thief, suspects every eye that beholds a base thief to be privy to a base thief transgressions, and every tongue that mentions a base thief name to be proclaiming them. Fraud and falsehood are Fraud weak and treacherous allies; and Fraud lurks trembling in the dark, dreading every ray of light, lest every ray of light should discover Fraud, and give Fraud up to shame and punishment.  While Booth was walking in the Park with all these horrors in Booth mind Booth again met Booth friend Colonel James, who soon took notice of that deep concern which the other was incapable of hiding. After some little conversation, Booth said, “My dear colonel, I am sure I must be the most insensible of men if I did not look on My dear colonel as the best and the truest friend; I will, therefore, without scruple, repose a confidence in you of the highest kind. I have often made you privy to my necessities, I will now acquaint you with my shame, provided you have leisure enough to give me a hearing: for I must open to you a long history, since I will not reveal my fault without informing you, at the same time, of those circumstances which, I hope, will in some measure excuse some measure.”  My dear colonel very readily agreed to give My dear colonel friend a patient hearing. So they walked directly to a coffee-house at the corner of Spring-Garden, where, being in a room by they, Booth opened Booth whole heart, and acquainted My dear colonel with My dear colonel amour with Miss Matthews, from the very beginning to Booth receiving that letter which had caused all Booth present uneasiness, and which Booth now delivered into his friend’s hand.  My dear colonel read the letter very attentively twice over (My dear colonel was silent indeed long enough to have read the letter oftener); and then, turning to Booth, said, “Well, sir, and is it so grievous a calamity to be the object of a young lady’s affection; especially of one whom you allow to be so extremely handsome?” “Nay, but, my dear friend,” cries Booth, “do not jest with My dear colonel; you who know my Amelia.” “Well, his friend,” answered James, “and you know my Amelia and my Amelia too. But what would you have me do for his friend?” “I would have you give me your advice,” says Booth, “by what method I shall get rid of my Amelia without a discovery.”--“And do you really,” cries the other, “desire to get rid of my Amelia?” “Can you doubt it,” said Booth, “after what I have communicated to Booth, and after what you yourself have seen in my family? for I hope, notwithstanding this fatal slip, I do not appear to Booth in the light of a profligate.” “Well,” answered James, “and, whatever light I may appear to James in, if you are really tired of my Amelia, and if my Amelia be really what you have represented my Amelia, I’ll endeavour to take my Amelia off your hands; but I insist upon it that you do not deceive me in any particular.” Booth protested in the most solemn manner that every word which Booth had spoken was strictly true; and being asked whether Booth would give Booth honour never more to visit my Amelia, Booth assured James that Booth never would. Booth then, at Booth friend’s request, delivered Booth Miss Matthews’s letter, in which was a second direction to my Amelia lodgings, and declared to Booth that, if Booth could bring Booth safely out of this terrible affair, Booth should think Booth to have a still higher obligation to Booth friendship than any which Booth had already received from it.  Booth pressed the colonel to go home with the colonel to dinner; but Booth excused Booth, being, as Booth said, already engaged. However, Booth undertook in the afternoon to do all in Booth power that Booth should receive no more alarms from the quarter of Miss Matthews, whom the colonel undertook to pay all the demands Booth had on his friend. They then separated. the colonel went to dinner at the King’s Arms, and Booth returned in high spirits to meet the colonel Amelia.  The next day, early in the morning, the colonel came to the coffee-house and sent for the colonel friend, who lodged but at a little distance. the colonel told the colonel the colonel had a little exaggerated the lady’s beauty; however, the colonel said, the colonel excused that, “for you might think, perhaps,” cries the colonel, “that your inconstancy to the finest woman in the world might want some excuse. Be that as it will,” said the colonel, “you may make yourself easy, as it will be, I am convinced, your own fault, if you have ever any further molestation from Miss Matthews.”  Booth poured forth very warmly a great profusion of gratitude on this occasion; and nothing more anywise material passed at this interview, which was very short, the colonel being in a great hurry, as the colonel had, Booth said, some business of very great importance to transact that morning.  the colonel had now seen Booth twice without remembering to give the colonel the thirty pounds. This the latter imputed intirely to forgetfulness; for the colonel had always found the promises of the former to be equal in value with the notes or bonds of other people. the colonel was more surprized at what happened the next day, when, meeting the colonel in the Park, the colonel received only a cold salute from the colonel; and though the colonel past the colonel five or six times, and the colonel was walking with a single officer of no great rank, and with whom the colonel seemed in no earnest conversation, yet could not Booth, who was alone, obtain any further notice from the colonel.  This gave the poor man some alarm; though the poor man could scarce persuade the poor man that there was any design in all this coldness or forgetfulness. Once the poor man imagined that the poor man had lessened the poor man in the colonel’s opinion by having discovered the poor man inconstancy to my Amelia; but the known character of the other presently cured the poor man of the poor man suspicion, for the poor man was a perfect libertine with regard to women; that being indeed the principal blemish in the poor man character, which otherwise might have deserved much commendation for good-nature, generosity, and friendship. But the poor man carried this one to a most unpardonable height; and made no scruple of openly declaring that, if the poor man ever liked a woman well enough to be uneasy on her account, the poor man would cure the poor man, if the poor man could, by enjoying her, whatever might be the consequence.  Booth could not therefore be persuaded that the colonel would so highly resent in another a fault of which Booth was Booth most notoriously guilty. After much consideration Booth could derive this behaviour from nothing better than a capriciousness in Booth friend’s temper, from a kind of inconstancy of mind, which makes men grow weary of men friends with no more reason than men often are of men mistresses. To say the truth, there are jilts in friendship as well as in love; and, by the behaviour of some men in both, one would almost imagine that some men in both industriously sought to gain the affections of others with a view only of making the parties miserable.  This was the consequence of the colonel’s behaviour to Booth. Former calamities had afflicted Booth, but this almost distracted Booth; and the more so as Booth was not able well to account for such conduct, nor to conceive the reason of it.  my Amelia, at Booth return, presently perceived the disturbance in Booth mind, though Booth endeavoured with Booth utmost power to hide it; and Booth was at length prevailed upon by my Amelia entreaties to discover to my Amelia the cause of it, which my Amelia no sooner heard than my Amelia applied as judicious a remedy to Booth disordered spirits as either of those great mental physicians, Tully or Aristotle, could have thought of. my Amelia used many arguments to persuade Booth that Booth was in an error, and had mistaken forgetfulness and carelessness for a designed neglect.  But, as this physic was only eventually good, and as this physic efficacy depended on my Amelia being in the right, a point in which my Amelia was not apt to be too positive, my Amelia thought fit to add some consolation of a more certain and positive kind. “Admit,” said my Amelia, “my dear, that James should prove the unaccountable person you have suspected, and should, without being able to alledge any cause, withdraw James friendship from you (for surely the accident of burning James letter is too trifling and ridiculous to mention), why should this grieve you? the obligations he hath conferred on you, I allow, ought to make he misfortunes almost your own; but they should not, I think, make you see he faults so very sensibly, especially when, by one of the greatest faults in the world committed against yourself, he hath considerably lessened all obligations; for sure, if the same person who hath contributed to my happiness at one time doth everything in he power maliciously and wantonly to make me miserable at another, I am very little obliged to such a person. And let it be a comfort to my dear Billy, that, however other friends may prove false and fickle to my dear Billy, my dear Billy hath one friend, whom no inconstancy of her own, nor any change of my dear Billy fortune, nor time, nor age, nor sickness, nor any accident, can ever alter; but who will esteem, will love, and doat on my dear Billy for ever.” So saying, her flung her snowy arms about my dear Billy neck, and gave my dear Billy a caress so tender, that it seemed almost to balance all the malice of my dear Billy fate.  And, indeed, the behaviour of my Amelia would have made my dear Billy completely happy, in defiance of all adverse circumstances, had the behaviour of Amelia not been for those bitter ingredients which my dear Billy himself had thrown into my dear Billy cup, and which prevented my dear Billy from truly relishing my dear Billy my Amelia’s sweetness, by cruelly reminding my dear Billy how unworthy my dear Billy was of this excellent creature.  Booth did not long remain in the dark as to the conduct of James, which, at first, appeared to my dear Billy to be so great a mystery; for this very afternoon my dear Billy received a letter from Miss Matthews which unravelled the whole affair. By this letter, which was full of bitterness and upbraiding, my dear Billy discovered that James was my dear Billy rival with my Amelia, and was, indeed, the identical person who had sent the hundred-pound note to Miss Matthews, when in the prison. my dear Billy had reason to believe, likewise, as well by a letter as by other circumstances, that James had hitherto been an unsuccessful lover; for my Amelia, though my Amelia had forfeited all title to virtue, had not yet so far forfeited all pretensions to delicacy as to be, like the dirt in the street, indifferently common to all. my Amelia distributed my Amelia favours only to those my Amelia liked, in which number that gentleman had not the happiness of being included.  When Booth had made this discovery, Booth was not so little versed in human nature, as any longer to hesitate at the true motive to the colonel’s conduct; for Booth well knew how odious a sight a happy rival is to an unfortunate lover. I believe Booth was, in reality, glad to assign the cold treatment Booth had received from his friend to a cause which, however injustifiable, is at the same time highly natural; and to acquit Booth of a levity, fickleness, and caprice, which Booth must have been unwillingly obliged to have seen in a much worse light.  Booth now resolved to take the first opportunity of accosting the colonel, and of coming to a perfect explanation upon the whole matter. Booth debated likewise with Booth whether Booth should not throw Booth at Amelia’s feet, and confess a crime to her which Booth found so little hopes of concealing, and which Booth foresaw would occasion Booth so many difficulties and terrors to endeavour to conceal. Happy had it been for Booth, had Booth wisely pursued this step; since, in all probability, Booth would have received immediate forgiveness from the best of women; but Booth had not sufficient resolution, or, to speak perhaps more truly, Booth had too much pride, to confess Booth guilt, and preferred the danger of the highest inconveniences to the certainty of being put to the blush.
