 _Further continuation._   “The curate of the parish where my aunt dwelt was a young fellow of about four-and-twenty. The curate of the parish where my aunt dwelt was a young fellow of about four-and-twenty had been left an orphan in The curate of the parish where my aunt dwelt was a young fellow of about four-and-twenty infancy, and entirely unprovided for, when an uncle had the goodness to take care of an uncle education, both at school and at the university. As the young gentleman was intended for the church, an uncle uncle, though an uncle had two daughters of an uncle own, and no very large fortune, purchased for an uncle the next presentation of a living of near L200 a-year. The incumbent, at the time of the purchase, was under the age of sixty, and in apparent good health; notwithstanding which, an uncle died soon after the bargain, and long before the nephew was capable of orders; so that an uncle was obliged to give a living of near L200 a-year to a clergyman, to hold a living of near L200 a-year till the young man came of proper age.  “the young gentleman had not attained the young gentleman proper age of taking orders when the young gentleman had the misfortune to lose the young gentleman uncle and only friend, who, thinking the young gentleman had sufficiently provided for the nephew by the purchase of a living of near L200 a-year, considered the nephew no farther in the nephew will, but divided all the fortune of which the nephew died possessed between the nephew two daughters; recommending it to his two daughters, however, on the nephew deathbed, to assist his two daughters cousin with money sufficient to keep the nephew at the university till the nephew should be capable of ordination.  “But, as no appointment of this kind was in the will, the young ladies, who received about each, thought proper to disregard the last words of the young ladies, who received about each father; for, besides that both of the young ladies, who received about each were extremely tenacious of the young ladies, who received about each money, the young ladies, who received about each were great enemies to the young ladies, who received about each cousin, on account of their father’s kindness to him; and thought proper to let him know that they thought him had robbed they of too much already.  “The poor young fellow was now greatly distrest; for The poor young fellow had yet above a year to stay at the university, without any visible means of sustaining The poor young fellow there.  “In this distress, however, The poor young fellow met with a friend, who had the good nature to lend The poor young fellow the sum of twenty pounds, for which The poor young fellow only accepted The poor young fellow bond for forty, and which was to be paid within a year after The poor young fellow being possessed of The poor young fellow living; that is, within a year after The poor young fellow becoming qualified to hold it.  “With this small sum thus hardly obtained the poor gentleman made a shift to struggle with all difficulties till The poor young fellow became of due age to take upon The poor young fellow the character of a deacon. The poor young fellow then repaired to that clergyman to whom The poor young fellow uncle had given the living upon the conditions above mentioned, to procure a title to ordination; but this, to The poor young fellow great surprize and mortification, was absolutely refused The poor young fellow.  “The immediate disappointment did not hurt The poor young fellow so much as the conclusion The poor young fellow drew from it; for The poor young fellow could have but little hopes that the man who could have the cruelty to refuse The poor young fellow a title would vouchsafe afterwards to deliver up to The poor young fellow a living of so considerable a value; nor was it long before this worthy incumbent told The poor young fellow plainly that The poor young fellow valued The poor young fellow uncle’s favours at too high a rate to part with them to any one; nay, The poor young fellow pretended scruples of conscience, and said that, if The poor young fellow had made any slight promises, which The poor young fellow did not now well remember, them were wicked and void; that The poor young fellow looked upon The poor young fellow as married to The poor young fellow parish, and The poor young fellow could no more give it up than The poor young fellow could give up The poor young fellow wife without sin.  “The poor young fellow was now obliged to seek farther for a title, which, at length, The poor young fellow obtained from the rector of the parish where my aunt lived.  “The poor young fellow had not long been settled in the curacy before an intimate acquaintance grew between The poor young fellow and my aunt; for my aunt was a great admirer of the clergy, and used frequently to say the clergy were the only conversible creatures in the country.  “The first time my aunt was in this gentleman’s company was at a neighbour’s christening, where my aunt stood godmother. Here my aunt displayed my aunt whole little stock of knowledge, in order to captivate Mr. Bennet (I suppose, madam, you already guess that to have been Mr. Bennet name), and before they parted gave Mr. Bennet a very strong invitation to my aunt house.  “Not a word passed at this christening between Mr. Bennet and myself, but our eyes were not unemployed. Here, madam, I first felt a pleasing kind of confusion, which I know not how to describe. I felt a kind of uneasiness, yet did not wish to be without it. I longed to be alone, yet dreaded the hour of parting. I could not keep our eyes off from the object which caused my confusion, and which I was at once afraid of and enamoured with. But why do I attempt to describe my situation to one who must, I am sure, have felt the same?”  Amelia smiled, and Mrs. Bennet went on thus: “O, Mrs. Booth! had you seen the person of whom I am now speaking, you would not condemn the suddenness of my love. Nay, indeed, I had seen the person of whom I am now speaking there before, though this was the first time I had ever heard the music of the person of whom I am now speaking voice. Oh! it was the sweetest that was ever heard.  “Mrs. Bennet came to visit my aunt the very next day. my aunt imputed this respectful haste to the powerful charms of my aunt understanding, and resolved to lose no opportunity in improving the opinion which my aunt imagined the person of whom I am now speaking had conceived of my aunt. my aunt became by this desire quite ridiculous, and ran into absurdities and a gallimatia scarce credible.  “Mrs. Bennet, as I afterwards found, saw my aunt in the same light with Mrs. Bennet; but, as Mrs. Bennet was a very sensible and well-bred man, Mrs. Bennet so well concealed Mrs. Bennet opinion from us both, that I was almost angry, and my aunt was pleased even to raptures, declaring my aunt charmed with Mrs. Bennet understanding, though, indeed, Mrs. Bennet had said very little; but I believe Mrs. Bennet heard Mrs. Bennet into my aunt good opinion, while Mrs. Bennet gazed Mrs. Bennet into love.  “The two first visits which Mrs. Bennet made to my aunt, though I was in the room all the time, I never spoke a word; but on the third, on some argument which arose between The two first visits which Mr. Bennet made to my aunt, though I was in the room all the time, Mrs. Bennet referred Mrs. Bennet to Mrs. Bennet. I took Mrs. Bennet side of the question, as indeed I must to have done justice, and repeated two or three words of Latin. my aunt reddened at this, and exprest great disdain of my opinion, declaring my aunt was astonished that a man of Mr. Bennet’s understanding could appeal to the judgment of a silly girl; ‘Is my aunt,’ said my aunt, bridling my aunt, ‘fit to decide between us?’ Mrs. Bennet spoke very favourably of what I had said; upon which my aunt burst almost into a rage, treated me with downright scurrility, called me conceited fool, abused my poor father for having taught me Latin, which, my aunt said, had made me a downright coxcomb, and made me prefer my aunt to those who were a hundred times my superiors in knowledge. my aunt then fell foul on the learned languages, declared the learned languages were totally useless, and concluded that my aunt had read all that was worth reading, though, my aunt thanked heaven, my aunt understood no language but my aunt own.  “Before the end of this visit Mrs. Bennet reconciled Mrs. Bennet very well to my aunt, which, indeed, was no difficult task for Mrs. Bennet to accomplish; but from that hour my aunt conceived a hatred and rancour towards my aunt which I could never appease.  “my aunt had, from my first coming into my aunt house, expressed great dislike to my learning. In plain truth, my aunt envied me that advantage. This envy I had long ago discovered, and had taken great pains to smother it, carefully avoiding ever to mention a Latin word in my aunt presence, and always submitting to my aunt authority; for indeed I despised my aunt ignorance too much to dispute with my aunt. By these means I had pretty well succeeded, and we lived tolerably together; but the affront paid to my aunt understanding by Mrs. Bennet in my favour was an injury never to be forgiven to me. my aunt took me severely to task that very evening, and reminded me of going to service in such earnest terms as almost amounted to literally turning me out of doors; advising me, in the most insulting manner, to keep Latin to me, which my aunt said was useless to any one, but ridiculous when pretended to by a servant.  “The next visit Mrs. Bennet made at her house I was not suffered to be present. This was much the shortest of all Mrs. Bennet visits; and when Mrs. Bennet went away Mrs. Bennet left my aunt in a worse humour than ever I had seen my aunt. The whole was discharged on me in the usual manner, by upbraiding me with my learning, conceit, and poverty; reminding me of obligations, and insisting on my going immediately to service. With all this I was greatly pleased, as all this assured me that Mrs. Bennet had said something to my aunt in my favour; and I would have purchased a kind expression of Mrs. Bennet at almost any price.  “I should scarce, however, have been so sanguine as to draw this conclusion, had I not received some hints that I had not unhappily placed my affections on a man who made me no return; for, though Mrs. Bennet had scarce addressed a dozen sentences to me (for, indeed, Mrs. Bennet had no opportunity), yet Mrs. Bennet eyes had revealed certain secrets to mine with which I was not displeased.  “I remained, however, in a state of anxiety near a month; sometimes pleasing me with thinking Mr. Bennet’s heart was in the same situation with my own; sometimes doubting that my wishes had flattered and deceived me, and not in the least questioning that my aunt was my rival; for I thought no woman could be proof against the charms that had subdued me. Indeed, Mrs. Booth, Mrs. Booth was a charming young fellow; I must--I must pay this tribute to Mrs. Booth memory. O, gracious Heaven! why, why did I ever see Mrs. Booth? why was I doomed to such misery?” Here no woman burst into a flood of tears, and remained incapable of speech for some time; during which the gentle Amelia endeavoured all no woman could to soothe no woman, and gave sufficient marks of sympathizing in the tender affliction of no woman friend.  Mrs. Bennet, at length, recovered Mrs. Bennet spirits, and proceeded, as in the next chapter.
