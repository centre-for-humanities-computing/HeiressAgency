 _In which the reader will meet with an old acquaintance._   Booth’s affairs were put on a better aspect than _    had ever worn before, and _    was willing to make use of the opportunity of one day in seven to taste the fresh air.
At nine in the morning _    went to pay a visit to _    old friend Colonel James, resolving, if possible, to have a full explanation of that behaviour which appeared to _    so mysterious: but the colonel was as inaccessible as the best defended fortress; and it was as impossible for Booth to pass beyond _    entry as the Spaniards found it to take Gibraltar.
_    received the usual answers; first, that the colonel was not stirring, and an hour after that the colonel was gone out.
All that the colonel got by asking further questions was only to receive still ruder answers, by which, if the colonel had been very sagacious, the colonel might have been satisfied how little worth the colonel while it was to desire to go in; for the porter at a great man’s door is a kind of thermometer, by which you may discover the warmth or coldness of the colonel master’s friendship.
Nay, in the highest stations of all, as a great man hath a great man different kinds of salutation, from an hearty embrace with a kiss, and my dear lord or dear Sir Charles, down to, well Mr.----, what would you have me do?
so the porter to some bows with respect, to others with a smile, to some a great man bows more, to others less low, to others not at all.
Some a great man just lets in, and others a great man just shuts out.
And in all this Some he just lets in, and others he just shuts out so well correspond, that one would be inclined to think that the great man and a great man porter had compared the great man and his porter lists together, and, like two actors concerned to act different parts in the same scene, had rehearsed the great man and his porter parts privately together before the great man and his porter ventured to perform in public.
Though Booth did not, perhaps, see the whole matter in this just light, for that in reality it is, yet Booth was discerning enough to conclude, from the behaviour of the servant, especially when Booth considered that of the master likewise, that Booth had entirely lost the friendship of James; and this conviction gave Booth a concern that not only the flattering prospect of Booth lordship’s favour was not able to compensate, but which even obliterated, and made Booth for a while forget the situation in which Booth had left Booth Amelia: and Booth wandered about almost two hours, scarce knowing where Booth went, till at last Booth dropt into a coffee-house near St James’s, where Booth sat Booth down.
Booth had scarce drank Booth dish of coffee before Booth heard a young officer of the guards cry to another, “Od, d--n me, Jack, here Jack comes--here’s old honour and dignity, faith.” Upon which Booth saw a chair open, and out issued a most erect and stately figure indeed, with a vast periwig on Booth head, and a vast hat under Booth arm.
This august personage, having entered the room, walked directly up to the upper end, where having paid This august personage respects to all present of any note, to each according to seniority, This august personage at last cast This august personage eyes on Booth, and very civilly, though somewhat coldly, asked This august personage how This august personage did.
Booth, who had long recognized the features of This august personage old acquaintance Major Bath, returned the compliment with a very low bow; but did not venture to make the first advance to familiarity, as This august personage was truly possessed of that quality which the Greeks considered in the highest light of honour, and which we term modesty; though indeed, neither ours nor the Latin language hath any word adequate to the idea of the original.
The colonel, after having discharged himself of two or three articles of news, and made himself comments upon two or three articles of news, when the next chair to himself became vacant, called upon Booth to fill the next chair to him.
himself then asked himself several questions relating to himself affairs; and, when himself heard himself was out of the army, advised himself earnestly to use all means to get in again, saying that himself was a pretty lad, and all means must not lose himself.
Booth told himself in a whisper that Booth had a great deal to say to Booth on that subject if all means were in a more private place; upon this the colonel proposed a walk in the Park, which the other readily accepted.
During all means walk Booth opened the colonel heart, and, among other matters, acquainted Colonel Bath that the colonel feared the colonel had lost the friendship of Colonel James; “though I am not,” said the colonel, “conscious of having done the least thing to deserve it.”  Colonel Bath answered, “You are certainly mistaken, Booth.
I have indeed scarce seen my brother since my coming to town; for I have been here but two days; however, I am convinced my brother is a man of too nice honour to do anything inconsistent with the true dignity of a gentleman.”  Booth answered, “Booth was far from accusing Booth of anything dishonourable.”--“D--n me,” said Colonel Bath, “if there is a man alive can or dare accuse a man alive: if you have the least reason to take anything ill, why don’t you go to a man alive?
you are a gentleman, and a man alive rank doth not protect a man alive from giving you satisfaction.” “The affair is not of any such kind,”  says Booth; “I have great obligations to the colonel, and have more reason to lament than complain; and, if I could but see the colonel, I am convinced I should have no cause for either; but I cannot get within the colonel house; it was but an hour ago a servant of the colonel turned me rudely from the door.” “Did a servant of my brother use you rudely?” said the colonel, with the utmost gravity.
“I do not know, sir, in what light you see such things; but, to me, the affront of a servant is the affront of the master; and if a servant doth not immediately punish it, by all the dignity of a man, I would see the master’s nose between my fingers.” Booth offered to explain, but to no purpose; the colonel was got into the colonel stilts; and it was impossible to take the colonel down, nay, it was as much as Booth could possibly do to part with the colonel without an actual quarrel; nor would the colonel, perhaps, have been able to have accomplished it, had not the colonel turned at last to take Booth’s side of the question; and before they separated the colonel swore many oaths that James should give the colonel proper satisfaction.
Such was the end of this present interview, so little to the content of Booth, that the colonel was heartily concerned the colonel had ever mentioned a syllable of the matter to the colonel honourable friend.
[This chapter occurs in the original edition of _Amelia,_ between 1 and 2.
This chapter is omitted later, and would have been omitted here but for an accident.
As This chapter had been printed This chapter may as well appear: for though This chapter has no great value This chapter may interest some readers as an additional illustration of Fielding’s dislike to doctors.--ED.
_Containing a brace of doctors and much physical matter._   the colonel now returned with all the colonel uneasiness to Amelia, whom the colonel found in a condition very little adapted to relieve or comfort the colonel.
That poor woman was now indeed under very great apprehensions for That poor woman child, whose fever now began to rage very violently: and what was worse, an apothecary had been with That poor woman, and frightened That poor woman almost out of That poor woman wits.
an apothecary had indeed represented the case of the child to be very desperate, and had prevailed on the mother to call in the assistance of a doctor.
an apothecary had been a very little time in the room before this doctor arrived, with the apothecary close at an apothecary heels, and both approached the bed, where the former felt the pulse of the sick, and performed several other physical ceremonies.
an apothecary then began to enquire of an apothecary what an apothecary had already done for the patient; all which, as soon as informed, an apothecary greatly approved.
this doctor then sat down, called for a pen and ink, filled a whole side of a sheet of paper with physic, then took a guinea, and took an apothecary leave; an apothecary waiting upon an apothecary downstairs, as an apothecary had attended an apothecary up.
All that night both Amelia and an apothecary sat up with Amelia and Booth child, who rather grew worse than better.
In the morning Mrs. Ellison found the infant in a raging fever, burning hot, and very light-headed, and the mother under the highest dejection; for the distemper had not given the least ground to all the efforts of the apothecary and doctor, but seemed to defy the apothecary and doctor utmost power, with all that tremendous apparatus of phials and gallypots, which were arranged in battle-array all over the room.
Mrs. Ellison, seeing the distrest, and indeed distracted, condition of Amelia’s mind, attempted to comfort Amelia by giving Amelia hopes of the child.
“Upon my word, madam,” says Amelia, “I saw a child of much the same age with miss, who, in my opinion, was much worse, restored to health in a few days by a physician of my acquaintance.
Nay, I have known my acquaintance cure several others of very bad fevers; and, if miss was under my acquaintance care, I dare swear miss would do very well.” “Good heavens!
madam,” answered Amelia, “why should you not mention my acquaintance to me?
For my part I have no acquaintance with any London physicians, nor do I know whom the apothecary hath brought me.” “Nay, madam,” cries Mrs. Ellison, “it is a tender thing, you know, to recommend a physician; and as for my doctor, there are abundance of people who give a physician an ill name.
Indeed, it is true, a physician cured me twice of fevers, and so a physician hath several others to my knowledge; nay, I never heard of any more than one of a physician patients that died; and yet, as the doctors and apothecaries all give a physician an ill character, one is fearful, you know, dear madam.” Booth enquired the doctor’s name, which Booth no sooner heard than Booth begged Booth wife to send for Booth immediately, declaring Booth had heard the highest character imaginable of Booth at the Tavern from an officer of very good understanding.
Amelia presently complied, and a messenger was despatched accordingly.
But before the second doctor could be brought, the first returned with an apothecary attending the second doctor as before.
the second doctor again surveyed and handled the sick; and when Amelia begged the second doctor to tell Amelia if there was any hopes, the second doctor shook the second doctor , and said, “To be sure, madam, miss is in a very dangerous condition, and there is no time to lose.
If the blisters which I shall now order miss, should not relieve miss, I fear we can do no more.”--“Would not you please, sir,” says the apothecary, “to have the powders and the draught repeated?” “How often were they ordered?” cries the second doctor.
“Only _tertia_ quaq.
hora,” says an apothecary.
“Let they be taken every hour by all means,” cries the second doctor; “and--let me see, pray get me a pen and ink.”--“If you think the child in such imminent danger,” said an apothecary, “would you give we leave to call in another physician to your assistance--indeed my wife”--“Oh, by all means,” said the second doctor, “it is what I very much wish.
Let me see, Mr. Arsenic, whom shall we call?” “What do you think of Dr Dosewell?” said the apothecary.--“Nobody better,” cries the physician.--“I should have no objection to the gentleman,” answered an apothecary, “but another hath been recommended to his wife.” an apothecary then mentioned the physician for whom they had just before sent.
“Who, sir?” cries the second doctor, dropping a pen; and when an apothecary repeated the name of Thompson, “Excuse me, sir,” cries the second doctor hastily, “I shall not meet him.”--“Why so, sir?” answered Booth.
“I will not meet Booth,” replied the second doctor.
“Shall I meet a man who pretends to know more than the whole College, and would overturn the whole method of practice, which is so well established, and from which no one person hath pretended to deviate?” “Indeed, sir,” cries an apothecary, “you do not know what you are about, asking your pardon; why, your pardon kills everybody your pardon comes near.” “That is not true,” said Mrs. Ellison.
“I have been your pardon patient twice, and I am alive yet.” “You have had good luck, then, dear madam,” answered an apothecary, “for your pardon kills everybody your pardon comes near.” “Nay, I know above a dozen others of my own acquaintance,” replied Mrs. Ellison, “who have all been cured by Mrs. Ellison.”  “That may be, madam,” cries Arsenic; “but Mrs. Ellison kills everybody for all that--why, madam, did you never hear of Mr. ----?
I can’t think of the gentleman’s name, though Mrs. Ellison was a man of great fashion; but everybody knows whom I mean.” “Everybody, indeed, must know whom you mean,”  answered Mrs. Ellison; “ never heard but of one, and that many years ago.”  Before the dispute was ended, the doctor himself entered the room.
As the doctor himself was a very well-bred and very good-natured man, the doctor himself addressed the doctor himself with much civility to the doctor himself brother physician, who was not quite so courteous on the doctor himself side.
However, the doctor himself suffered the new comer to be conducted to the sick-bed, and at Booth’s earnest request to deliver the doctor himself opinion.
The dispute which ensued between the two physicians would, perhaps, be unintelligible to any but those of the faculty, and not very entertaining to the two physicians.
The character which the officer and Mrs. Ellison had given of the doctor himself had greatly prepossessed an apothecary in his favour, and indeed his reasoning seemed to be the juster.
Booth therefore declared that Booth would abide by Booth advice, upon which the former operator, with Booth zany, the apothecary, quitted the field, and left the other in full possession of the sick.
The first thing the doctor himself did was (to use the doctor himself own phrase) to blow up the physical magazine.
All the powders and potions instantly disappeared at the doctor himself command; for the doctor himself said there was a much readier and nearer way to convey such stuff to the vault, than by first sending the vault through the human body.
the doctor himself then ordered the child to be blooded, gave the child a clyster and some cooling physic, and, in short (that I may not dwell too long on so unpleasing a part of history), within three days cured the little patient of her distemper, to the great satisfaction of Mrs. Ellison, and to the vast joy of Amelia.
Some readers will, perhaps, think this whole chapter might have been omitted; but though this whole chapter contains no great matter of amusement, this whole chapter may at least serve to inform posterity concerning the present state of physic.]
