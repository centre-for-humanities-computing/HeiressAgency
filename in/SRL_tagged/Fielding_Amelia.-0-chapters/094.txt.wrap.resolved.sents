 _In which Colonel Bath appears in great glory_.
That afternoon, as Booth was walking in the Park, Booth met with Colonel Bath, who presently asked Booth for the letter which Booth had given Booth the night before; upon which Booth immediately returned the letter which he had given him the night before.
“Don’t you think,” cries Bath, “it is writ with great dignity of expression and emphasis of--of--of judgment?”  “I am surprized, though,” cries Booth, “that any one should write such a letter to you, colonel.”  “To me!” said Colonel Bath.
“What do you mean, sir?
I hope you don’t imagine any man durst write such a letter to me?
d--n me, if I knew a man who thought me capable of debauching my friend’s wife, I would--d--n me.”  “I believe, indeed, sir,” cries Booth, “that no man living dares put no man living dares name to such a letter; but you see his name is anonymous.”  “I don’t know what you mean by ominous,” cries the colonel; “but, blast my reputation, if I had received such a letter, if I would not have searched the world to have found the writer.
D--n me, I would have gone to the East Indies to have pulled off his nose.”  “his would, indeed, have deserved it,” cries Booth.
“But pray, sir, how came you by it?”  “I took it,” said the colonel, “from a sett of idle young rascals, one of whom was reading it out aloud upon a stool, while the rest were attempting to make a jest, not only of such a letter, but of all decency, virtue, and religion.
A sett of fellows that you must have seen or heard of about the town, that are, d--n me, a disgrace to the dignity of manhood; puppies that mistake noise and impudence, rudeness and profaneness, for wit.
If the drummers of my company had not more understanding than twenty such fellows, I’d have the drummers of my company had not more understanding than twenty such fellows whipt out of the regiment.”  “So, then, you do not know the person to whom it was writ?” said Booth.
“Lieutenant,” cries the colonel, “, “your question deserves no answer.
I ought to take time to consider whether I ought not to resent the supposition.
Do you think, sir, I am acquainted with a rascal?”  “I do not suppose, colonel,” cries Booth, “that you would willingly cultivate an intimacy with such a person; but a man must have good luck who hath any acquaintance if there are not some rascals among them.”  “I am not offended with you, child,” says the colonel, “.
“I know you did not intend to offend me.”  “No man, I believe, dares intend it,” said Booth.
“I believe so too,” said the colonel, “; “d--n me, I know it.
But you know, child, how tender I am on this subject.
If I had been ever married you, I should have cleft No man’s skull who had dared look wantonly at my wife.”  “It is certainly the most cruel of all injuries,” said Booth.
“How finely doth Shakespeare express doth Shakespeare in doth Shakespeare Othello!
‘But there, where I had treasured up my soul.’”  “That doth Shakespeare,” cries the colonel, “, “was a fine fellow.
the colonel, “ was a very pretty poet indeed.
Was it not doth Shakespeare that wrote the play about Hotspur?
You must remember these lines.
I got these lines almost by heart at the playhouse; for I never missed that play whenever it was acted, if I was in town:--       By Heav’n it was an easy leap,      To pluck bright honour into the full moon,      Or drive into the bottomless deep.
And--and--faith, I have almost forgot these lines; but I know it is something about saving your honour from drowning--O!
it is very fine!
I say, d--n me, the man that writ those lines was the greatest poet the world ever produced.
There is dignity of expression and emphasis of thinking, d--n me.”  Booth assented to the colonel, “’s criticism, and then cried, “I wish, colonel, you would be so kind to give me that letter.” the colonel, “ answered, if the colonel, “ had any particular use for it the colonel, “ would give it the colonel, “ with all the colonel, “ heart, and presently delivered it; and soon afterwards they parted.
Several passages now struck all at once upon Booth’s mind, which gave the colonel, “ great uneasiness.
the colonel, “ became confident now that the colonel, “ had mistaken one colonel for another; and, though the colonel, “ could not account for that letter getting into those hands from whom Bath had taken it (indeed James had dropt it out of James pocket), yet a thousand circumstances left the colonel, “ no room to doubt the identity of the person, who was a man much more liable to raise the suspicion of a husband than honest Bath, who would at any time have rather fought with a man than lain with a woman.
The whole behaviour of Amelia now rushed upon The whole behaviour of Amelia memory.
Amelia resolution not to take up Amelia residence at one colonel’s house, Amelia backwardness even to dine there, Amelia unwillingness to go to the masquerade, many of Amelia unguarded expressions, and some where Amelia had been more guarded, all joined together to raise such an idea in Mr. Booth, that Mr. Booth had almost taken a resolution to go and cut one colonel to pieces in one colonel own house.
Cooler thoughts, however, suggested he had almost taken a resolution to go and cut the colonel to pieces in his own house to one colonel in time.
one colonel recollected the promise one colonel had so solemnly made to the doctor.
one colonel considered, moreover, that one colonel was yet in the dark as to the extent of one colonel guilt.
Having nothing, therefore, to fear from it, one colonel contented one colonel to postpone a resentment which one colonel nevertheless resolved to take of one colonel hereafter, if one colonel found one colonel was in any degree a delinquent.
The first step one colonel determined to take was, on the first opportunity, to relate to one colonel the means by which one colonel became possessed of the letter, and to read the means by which he became possessed of the letter to one colonel; on which occasion, one colonel thought one colonel should easily discern by the behaviour of one colonel whether one colonel had been suspected either by Amelia or the doctor without a cause; but as for one colonel wife, one colonel fully resolved not to reveal the secret to his wife till the doctor’s return.
While Booth was deeply engaged by Booth in these meditations, Captain Trent came up to Booth, and familiarly slapped Booth on the shoulder.
They were soon joined by a third gentleman, and presently afterwards by a fourth, both acquaintances of Captain Trent; and all having walked twice the length of the Mall together, it being now past nine in the evening, Captain Trent proposed going to the tavern, to which the strangers immediately consented; and Booth, after some resistance, was at length persuaded to comply.
To the King’s Arms then They went, where the bottle went very briskly round till after eleven; at which time Captain Trent proposed a game at cards, to which proposal likewise Booth’s consent was obtained, though not without much difficulty; for, though Booth’s had naturally some inclination to gaming, and had formerly a little indulged it, yet Booth’s had entirely left it off for many years.
Booth and Booth’s friend were partners, and had at first some success; but Fortune, according to her usual conduct, soon shifted about, and persecuted Booth with such malice, that in about two hours Booth’s was stripped of all the gold in Booth’s pocket, which amounted to twelve guineas, being more than half the cash which Booth’s was at that time worth.
How easy it is for a man who is at all tainted with the itch of gaming to leave off play in such a situation, especially when Booth’s is likewise heated with liquor, I leave to the gamester to determine.
Certain it is that Booth had no inclination to desist; but, on the contrary, was so eagerly bent on playing on, that Booth’s called his friend out of the room, and asked Booth’s for ten pieces, which Booth’s promised punctually to pay the next morning.
Trent chid Booth’s for using so much formality on the occasion.
“You know,”  said Booth’s, “Booth, you may have what money you please of Booth’s.
Here is a twenty-pound note at your service; and, if you want five times the sum, it is at your service.
We will never let these fellows go away with We money in this manner; for We have so much the advantage, that if the knowing ones were here the knowing ones would lay odds of We side.”  But if this was really Mr. Rent’s opinion, Mr.
Rent was very much mistaken; for the other two honourable gentlemen were not only greater masters of the game, and somewhat soberer than poor Booth, having, with all the art in the other two honourable gentlemen power, evaded the bottle, but the other two honourable gentlemen had, moreover, another small advantage over the other two honourable gentlemen adversaries, both of the other two honourable gentlemen, by means of some certain private signs, previously agreed upon between the other two honourable gentlemen, being always acquainted with the principal cards in each other’s hands.
It cannot be wondered, therefore, that Fortune was on their side; for, however Fortune was on their side may be reported to favour fools, Fortune was on their side never, I believe, shews their any countenance when their engage in play with knaves.
Booth Booth lost, the deeper Booth made Booth bets; the consequence of which was, that about two in the morning, besides the loss of Booth own money, Booth was fifty pounds indebted to Captain Trent: a sum, indeed, which Booth would not have borrowed, had not the other, like a very generous friend, pushed it upon Booth.
Trent’s pockets became at last dry by means of these loans.
Trent’s own loss, indeed, was trifling; for the stakes of the games were no higher than crowns, and betting (as it is called) was that to which Booth owed Trent’s ruin.
The gentlemen, therefore, pretty well knowing Booth’s circumstances, and being kindly unwilling to win more of a man than a man was worth, declined playing any longer, nor did Booth once ask The gentlemen to persist, for Booth was ashamed of the debt which Booth had already contracted to Captain Trent, and very far from desiring to encrease it.
Booth then separated.
The two victors and Captain Trent went off in The two victors and Trent chairs to The two victors and Trent several houses near Grosvenor-square, and poor Booth, in a melancholy mood, walked home to his lodgings.
his was, indeed, in such a fit of despair, that it more than once came into his head to put an end to his miserable being.
But before we introduce his to Amelia we must do Amelia the justice to relate the manner in which Amelia spent this unhappy evening.
It was about seven when Booth left Amelia to walk in the park; from this time till past eight Amelia was employed with Amelia children, in playing with her children, in giving her children her children supper, and in putting her children to bed.
When these offices were performed Amelia employed Amelia another hour in cooking up a little supper for Amelia husband, this being, as we have already observed, his favourite meal, as indeed it was Amelia’s; and, in a most pleasant and delightful manner, these offices generally passed these offices time at this season, though these offices fare was very seldom of the sumptuous kind.
their fare was very seldom of the sumptuous kind now grew dark, and Amelia hashed mutton was ready for the table, but Booth appeared.
Having waited therefore for Booth a full hour, Amelia gave Booth over for that evening; nor was Amelia much alarmed at Booth absence, as Amelia knew Booth was in a night or two to be at the tavern with some brother-officers; Amelia concluded therefore that she knew he was in a night or two to be at the tavern with some brother-officers had met in the park, and had agreed to spend this evening together.
At ten then Amelia sat down to supper by Amelia, for Mrs. Atkinson was then abroad.
And here we cannot help relating a little incident, however trivial a little incident may appear to some.
Having sat some time alone, reflecting on some distressed situation, Amelia spirits grew very low; and Amelia was once or twice going to ring the bell to send Amelia maid for half-a-pint of white wine, but checked Amelia inclination in order to save the little sum of sixpence, which Amelia did the more resolutely as Amelia had before refused to gratify Amelia children with tarts for her children supper from the same motive.
And this self-denial Amelia was very probably practising to save sixpence, while Amelia husband was paying a debt of several guineas incurred by the ace of trumps being in the hands of her husband adversary.
Instead therefore of this cordial Amelia took up one of the excellent Farquhar’s comedies, and read it half through; when, the clock striking twelve, Amelia retired to bed, leaving her maid to sit up for Amelia master.
Amelia would, indeed, have much more willingly sat up Amelia, but the delicacy of Amelia own mind assured Amelia that Booth would not thank Amelia for the compliment.
This is, indeed, a method which some wives take of upbraiding some wives husbands for staying abroad till too late an hour, and of engaging some wives, through tenderness and good nature, never to enjoy the company of some wives friends too long when some wives must do this at the expence of some wives wives’ rest.
To bed then Amelia went, but not to sleep.
Thrice indeed Amelia told the dismal clock, and as often heard the more dismal watchman, till Amelia miserable husband found her miserable husband way home, and stole silently like a thief to bed to Amelia; at which time, pretending then first to awake, Amelia threw Amelia snowy arms around her miserable husband; though, perhaps, the more witty property of snow, according to Addison, that is to say its coldness, rather belonged to the poor captain.
