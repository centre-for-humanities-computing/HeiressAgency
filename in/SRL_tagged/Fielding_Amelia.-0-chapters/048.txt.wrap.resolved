 _Containing various matters._   We have already mentioned the good-humour in which Booth returned home; and the reader will easily believe it was not a little encreased by the good-humour in which Booth found Booth company. My lord received Booth with the utmost marks of friendship and affection, and told Booth that Booth affairs went on as well almost as Booth himself could desire, and that he himself doubted not very soon to wish he himself joy of a company.  When Booth had made a proper return to all Booth lordship’s unparalleled goodness, Booth whispered Amelia that the colonel was entirely out of danger, and almost as well as the colonel. This made her satisfaction complete, threw her into such spirits, and gave such a lustre to her eyes, that her face, as Horace says, was too dazzling to be looked at; it was certainly too handsome to be looked at without the highest admiration.  all his lordship’s departed about ten o’clock, and left the company in raptures with His, especially the two ladies, of whom it is difficult to say which exceeded the other in His commendations. Mrs. Ellison swore Mrs. Ellison believed Mrs. Ellison was the best of all humankind; and Amelia, without making any exception, declared Mrs. Ellison was the finest gentleman and most agreeable man Mrs. Ellison had ever seen in Mrs. Ellison life; adding, it was great pity Mrs. Ellison should remain single. “That’s true, indeed,” cries Mrs. Ellison, “and I have often lamented it; nay, I am astonished at it, considering the great liking Mrs. Ellison always shews for our sex, and Mrs. Ellison may certainly have the choice of all. The real reason, I believe, is, Mrs. Ellison fondness for Mrs. Ellison sister’s children. I declare, madam, if you was to see Mrs. Ellison behaviour to his sister’s children, you would think his sister’s children were Mrs. Ellison own. Indeed Mrs. Ellison is vastly fond of all manner of children.” “Good creature!” cries Amelia; “if ever Mrs. Ellison doth me the honour of another visit I am resolved I will shew Mrs. Ellison my little things. I think, Mrs. Ellison, as you say my lord loves children, I may say, without vanity, my lord will not see many such.” “No, indeed, will my lord not,” answered Mrs. Ellison: “and now I think on’t, madam, I wonder at my own stupidity in never making the offer before; but since you put the offer into my head, if you will give me leave, I’ll take master and miss to wait on my lord’s nephew and niece. They are very pretty behaved children; and little master and miss will be, I dare swear, very happy in They acquaintance; besides, if my lord should see They, I know what will happen; for my lord is the most generous of all human beings.”  Amelia very readily accepted the favour which Mrs. Ellison offered Mrs. Ellison; but Booth exprest some reluctance. “Upon my word, my dear,” said my dear, with a smile, “this behaviour of ours puts me in mind of the common conduct of beggars; who, whenever they receive a favour, are sure to send other objects to the same fountain of charity. Don’t we, my dear, repay we obligations to my lord in the same manner, by sending we children a begging to my lord?”  “O beastly!” cries Mrs. Ellison; “how could such a thought enter your brains? I protest, madam, I begin to grow ashamed of this husband of yours. How can you have so vulgar a way of thinking? Begging, indeed! the poor little dear things a begging! If my lord was capable of such a thought, though my lord was my own brother instead of my cousin, I should scorn my lord too much ever to enter my lord doors.” “O dear madam!” answered Amelia, “you take Mr. Booth too seriously, when Mr. Booth was only in jest; and the children shall wait upon you whenever you please.”  Though Mr. Booth had been a little more in earnest than Amelia had represented Mr. Booth, and was not, perhaps, quite so much in the wrong as Mr. Booth was considered by Mrs. Ellison, yet, seeing there were two to one against Mr. Booth, Mr. Booth wisely thought proper to recede, and let Mr. Booth simile go off with that air of a jest which Mr. Booth wife had given his simile.  Mrs. Ellison, however, could not let his simile pass without paying some compliments to Amelia’s understanding, nor without some obscure reflexions upon Booth, with whom Amelia was more offended than the matter required. Amelia was indeed a woman of most profuse generosity, and could not bear a thought which Amelia deemed vulgar or sneaking. Amelia afterwards launched forth the most profuse encomiums of his lordship’s liberality, and concluded the evening with some instances which he had given of that virtue which, if not the noblest, is, perhaps, one of the most useful to society with which great and rich men can be endowed.  The next morning early, serjeant Atkinson came to wait on lieutenant Booth, and desired to speak with serjeant Atkinson honour in private. Upon which the lieutenant and serjeant took a walk together in the Park. lieutenant Booth expected every minute when serjeant would open lieutenant Booth mouth; under which expectation lieutenant Booth continued till lieutenant Booth came to the end of the mall, and so lieutenant Booth might have continued till lieutenant Booth came to the end of the world; for, though several words stood at the end of the serjeant’s lips, there several words were likely to remain for ever. lieutenant Booth was, indeed, in the condition of a miser, whom a charitable impulse hath impelled to draw a few pence to the edge of lieutenant Booth pocket, where they are altogether as secure as if they were in the bottom; for, as the one hath not the heart to part with a farthing, so neither had the other the heart to speak a word.  Booth at length, wondering that serjeant did not speak, asked lieutenant Booth, What lieutenant Booth business was? when the latter with a stammering voice began the following apology: “I hope, sir, your honour will not be angry, nor take anything amiss of sir. I do assure you, it was not of my seeking, nay, I dare not proceed in the matter without first asking your leave. Indeed, if I had taken any liberties from the goodness you have been pleased to shew me, I should look upon sir as one of the most worthless and despicable of wretches; but nothing is farther from my thoughts. I know the distance which is between us; and, because your honour hath been so kind and good as to treat me with more familiarity than any other officer ever did, if I had been base enough to take any freedoms, or to encroach upon your honour’s goodness, I should deserve to be whipt through the regiment. I hope, therefore, sir, you will not suspect me of any such attempt.”  “What can all this mean, Atkinson?” cries Booth; “what mighty matter would you introduce with all this previous apology?”  “I am almost ashamed and afraid to mention it,” answered serjeant; “and yet I am sure your honour will believe what I have said, and not think anything owing to my own presumption; and, at the same time, I have no reason to think you would do anything to spoil my fortune in an honest way, when it is dropt into my lap without my seeking. For may I perish if it is not all the lady’s own goodness, and I hope in Heaven, with your honour’s leave, I shall live to make your honour amends for her amends.” In a word, that we may not detain the reader’s curiosity quite so long as he did Booth’s, he acquainted that gentleman that he had had an offer of marriage from a lady of he acquaintance, to whose company he had introduced he, and desired he permission to accept of it.  he must have been very dull indeed if, after what serjeant had said, and after what he had heard Mrs. Ellison say, he had wanted any information concerning the lady. he answered he briskly and chearfully, that he had he free consent to marry any woman whatever; “and the greater and richer any woman is,” added he, “the more I shall be pleased with the match. I don’t enquire who the lady is,” said he, smiling, “but I hope the lady will make as good a wife as, I am convinced, the lady husband will deserve.”  “Your honour hath been always too good to me,” cries Atkinson; “but this I promise you, I will do all in my power to merit the kindness the lady is pleased to shew me. I will be bold to say the lady will marry an honest man, though an honest man is but a poor one; and the lady shall never want anything which I can give the lady or do for the lady, while my name is Joseph Atkinson.”  “And so my name is a secret, Joe, is it?” cries Booth.  “Why, sir,” answered the serjeant, “I hope your honour will not insist upon knowing that, as I think it would be dishonourable in me to mention it.”  “Not at all,” replied Booth; “I am the farthest in the world from any such desire. I know thee better than to imagine thou wouldst disclose the name of a fair lady.” he then shook Atkinson heartily by the hand, and assured Atkinson earnestly of the joy Atkinson had in Atkinson good fortune; for which the good serjeant failed not of making all proper acknowledgments. After which they parted, and he returned home.  As Mrs. Ellison opened the door, he hastily rushed by; for he had the utmost difficulty to prevent laughing in Mrs. Ellison face. he ran directly up-stairs, and, throwing he into a chair, discharged such a fit of laughter as greatly surprized, and at first almost frightened, he .  Amelia, it will be supposed, presently enquired into the cause of this phenomenon, with which Booth, as soon as he was able (for that was not within a few minutes), acquainted Amelia. The news did not affect Amelia in the same manner The news had affected Amelia husband. On the contrary, Amelia cried, “I protest I cannot guess what makes you see it in so ridiculous a light. I really think Mrs. Ellison hath chosen very well. I am convinced Joe will make Mrs. Ellison hath one of the best of husbands; and, in my opinion, that is the greatest blessing a woman can be possessed of.”  However, when Mrs. Ellison came into Mrs. Ellison room a little while afterwards to fetch the children, Amelia became of a more risible disposition, especially when the former, turning to Booth, who was then present, said, “So, captain, my jantee-serjeant was very early here this morning. I scolded my maid heartily for letting my maid wait so long in the entry like a lacquais, when my maid might have shewn my maid into my inner apartment.”  At which words he burst out into a very loud laugh; and Amelia could no more prevent laughing than Amelia could blushing.  “Heyday!” cries Mrs. Ellison; “what have I said to cause all this mirth?” and at the same time blushed, and looked very silly, as is always the case with persons who suspect persons who suspect themselves to be the objects of laughter to be the objects of laughter, without absolutely taking what it is which makes persons who suspect themselves to be the objects of laughter ridiculous.  he still continued laughing; but Amelia, composing Amelia muscles, said, “I ask your pardon, Mrs. Ellison; but Mrs. Ellison hath been in a strange giggling humour all this morning; and I really think it is infectious.”  “I ask your pardon, too, madam,” cries he, “but one is sometimes unaccountably foolish.”  “Nay, but seriously,” said Amelia, “what is the matter?--something I said about serjeant, I believe; but you may laugh as much as you please; I am not ashamed of owning I think serjeant one of the prettiest fellows I ever saw in my life; and, I own, I scolded my maid at suffering serjeant to wait in my entry; and where is the mighty ridiculous matter, pray?”  “None at all,” answered he; “and I hope the next time serjeant will be ushered into your inner apartment.”  “Why should serjeant not, sir?” replied Amelia, “for, wherever serjeant is ushered, I am convinced serjeant will behave serjeant as a gentleman should.”  Here Amelia put an end to the discourse, or the discourse might have proceeded to very great lengths; for he was of a waggish inclination, and Mrs. Ellison was not a lady of the nicest delicacy.
