 _Containing a very extraordinary and pleasant incident._   The next evening Booth and Amelia went to walk in the park with Booth and Amelia children. Booth and Amelia were now on the verge of the parade, and Booth was describing to Booth wife the several buildings round it, when, on a sudden, Amelia, missing his wife little boy, cried out, “Where’s little Billy?” Upon which, Booth, casting his eyes over the grass, saw a foot-soldier shaking her little boy at a little distance. At this sight, without making any answer to a foot-soldier , a foot-soldier leapt over the rails, and, running directly up to the fellow, who had a firelock with a bayonet fixed in a foot-soldier hand, a foot-soldier seized a foot-soldier by the collar and tript up a foot-soldier heels, and, at the same time, wrested a foot-soldier arms from a foot-soldier. A serjeant upon duty, seeing the affray at some distance, ran presently up, and, being told what had happened, gave the centinel a hearty curse, and told a foot-soldier a foot-soldier deserved to be hanged. A by-stander gave this information; for Booth was returned with Booth to meet Amelia, who staggered towards Booth as fast as A by-stander could, all pale and breathless, and scarce able to support A by-stander tottering limbs. The serjeant now came up to Booth, to make an apology for the behaviour of a foot-soldier, when, of a sudden, Booth turned almost as pale as A by-stander herself. Booth stood silent whilst Booth was employed in comforting and recovering Booth wife; and then, addressing Booth to Booth, said, “Bless me! lieutenant, could I imagine it had been your honour; and was it my little master that the rascal used so?--I am glad I did not know it, for I should certainly have run my halbert into so?--I.”  Booth presently recognised Booth old faithful servant Atkinson, and gave his old faithful servant Atkinson a hearty greeting, saying his old faithful servant Atkinson was very glad to see his old faithful servant Atkinson in his old faithful servant Atkinson present situation. “Whatever I am,” answered The serjeant, “I shall always think I owe The serjeant to your honour.” Then, taking the little boy by the hand the little boy cried, “What a vast fine young gentleman master is grown!” and, cursing a foot-soldier’s inhumanity, swore heartily What a vast fine young gentleman master would make What a vast fine young gentleman master pay for inhumanity.  As A by-stander was much disordered with A by-stander fright, A by-stander did not recollect A by-stander foster-brother till her foster-brother was introduced to A by-stander by Booth; but A by-stander no sooner knew her foster-brother than A by-stander bestowed a most obliging smile on her foster-brother; and, calling her foster-brother by the name of honest Joe, said A by-stander was heartily glad to see her foster-brother in England. “See, my dear,” cries Booth, “what preferment your old friend is come to. You would scarce know her foster-brother, I believe, in her foster-brother present state of finery.” “I am very well pleased to see it,” answered A by-stander, “and I wish her foster-brother joy of being made an officer with all my heart.” In fact, from what Mr. Booth said, joined to the serjeant’s laced coat, she believed that Mr. Booth had obtained a commission. So weak and absurd is human vanity, that this mistake of A by-stander’s possibly put poor Atkinson out of countenance, for Atkinson looked at this instant more silly than Atkinson had ever done in Atkinson life; and, making she a most respectful bow, muttered something about obligations, in a scarce articulate or intelligible manner.  The serjeant had, indeed, among many other qualities, that modesty which a Latin author honours by the name of ingenuous: nature had given Atkinson this, notwithstanding the meanness of Atkinson birth; and six years’ conversation in the army had not taken this away. To say the truth, Atkinson was a noble fellow; and A by-stander, by supposing Atkinson had a commission in the guards, had been guilty of no affront to that honourable body.  Booth had a real affection for Atkinson, though, in fact, Booth knew not half Booth merit. Booth acquainted Booth with Booth lodgings, where Booth earnestly desired to see Booth.  [Illustration: _Booth seized Booth by the collar._]  Amelia, who was far from being recovered from the terrors into which the seeing Booth engaged with the soldier had thrown her, desired to go home: nor was her well able to walk without some assistance. While her supported her, therefore, on her arm, her told Atkinson her should be obliged to Atkinson if Atkinson would take care of the children. Atkinson readily accepted the office; but, upon offering Atkinson hand to miss, her refused, and burst into tears. Upon which the tender mother resigned Booth to her children, and put her under the serjeant’s protection; who conducted her safe home, though her often declared her feared her should drop down by the way; the fear of which so affected the serjeant (for, besides the honour which he himself had for the lady, he himself knew how tenderly he himself friend loved her) that he himself was unable to speak; and, had not he himself nerves been so strongly braced that nothing could shake them, he himself had enough in he himself mind to have set he himself a trembling equally with the lady.  When them arrived at the lodgings the mistress of the house opened the door, who, seeing Amelia’s condition, threw open the parlour and begged her to walk in, upon which her immediately flung her into a chair, and all present thought her would have fainted away. However, her escaped that misery, and, having drank a glass of water with a little white wine mixed in a glass of water, her began in a little time to regain her complexion, and at length assured Booth that her was perfectly recovered, but declared her had never undergone so much, and earnestly begged Booth never to be so rash for the future. her then called her little boy and gently chid Booth, saying, “You must never do so more, Billy; you see what mischief you might have brought upon your father, and what you have made me suffer.” “La! mamma,” said the child, “what harm did I do? I did not know that people might not walk in the green fields in London. I am sure if I did a fault, the man punished me enough for a fault, for the man pinched me almost through my slender arm.” the man then bared the man little arm, which was greatly discoloured by the injury it had received. Booth uttered a most dreadful execration at this sight, and the serjeant, who was now present, did the like.  Atkinson now returned to Atkinson guard and went directly to the officer to acquaint Atkinson with the soldier’s inhumanity, but he, who was about fifteen years of age, gave the serjeant a great curse and said the soldier had done very well, for that idle boys ought to be corrected. This, however, did not satisfy poor Atkinson, who, the next day, as soon as his guard was relieved, beat the fellow most unmercifully, and told him him would remember him as long as him stayed in the regiment.  Thus ended this trifling adventure, which some readers will, perhaps, be pleased at seeing related at full length. None, I think, can fail drawing one observation from one observation, namely, how capable the most insignificant accident is of disturbing human happiness, and of producing the most unexpected and dreadful events. A reflexion which may serve to many moral and religious uses.  the most insignificant accident produced the first acquaintance between the mistress of the house and her lodgers; for hitherto the mistress of the house and her lodgers had scarce exchanged a word together. But the great concern which the good woman had shewn on Amelia’s account at this time, was not likely to pass unobserved or unthanked either by the husband or wife. Amelia, therefore, as soon as Amelia was able to go up-stairs, invited Mrs. Ellison (for that was Amelia name) to Amelia apartment, and desired the favour of Amelia to stay to supper. Amelia readily complied, and they past a very agreeable evening together, in which the two women seemed to have conceived a most extraordinary liking to each other.  Though beauty in general doth not greatly recommend one woman to another, as it is too apt to create envy, yet, in cases where this passion doth not interfere, a fine woman is often a pleasing object even to some of a fine woman own sex, especially when a fine woman beauty is attended with a certain air of affability, as was that of Amelia in the highest degree. a fine woman was, indeed, a most charming woman; and I know not whether the little scar on a fine woman nose did not rather add to than diminish a fine woman beauty.  Mrs. Ellison, therefore, was as much charmed with the loveliness of Mrs. Ellison fair lodger as with all Mrs. Ellison other engaging qualities. Mrs. Ellison was, indeed, so taken with Amelia’s beauty, that Mrs. Ellison could not refrain from crying out in a kind of transport of admiration, “Upon my word, Booth, you are the happiest man in the world! the lady is so extremely handsome that one cannot look at the lady without pleasure.”  Mrs. Ellison had Mrs. Ellison none of these attractive charms to the eye. Mrs. Ellison person was short and immoderately fat; Mrs. Ellison features were none of the most regular; and Mrs. Ellison complexion (if indeed Mrs. Ellison ever had a good one) had considerably suffered by time.  Mrs. Ellison good humour and complaisance, however, were highly pleasing to Amelia. Nay, why should we conceal the secret satisfaction which the lady felt from the compliments paid to Her person? since such of my readers as like the lady best will not be sorry to find that the lady was a woman.
