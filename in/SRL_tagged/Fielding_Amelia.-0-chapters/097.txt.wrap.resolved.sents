 _Contains a letter and other matters_.
We will now return to Amelia; to whom, immediately upon Amelia husband’s departure to walk with Mr. Trent, a porter brought the following letter, which Amelia immediately opened and read:  “MADAM,--The quick despatch which I have given to your first commands will I hope assure you of the diligence with which I shall always obey every command that you are pleased to honour me with.
I have, indeed, in this trifling affair, acted as if my life itself had been at stake; nay, I know not but it may be so; for this insignificant matter, you was pleased to tell me, would oblige the charming person in whose power is not only my happiness, but, as I am well persuaded, my life too.
Let me reap therefore some little advantage in your eyes, as you have in mine, from this trifling occasion; for, if anything could add to the charms of which you are mistress, it would be perhaps that amiable zeal with which you maintain the cause of your friend.
I hope, indeed, your friend will be your friend and advocate with the most lovely of your friend sex, as I think your friend hath reason, and as you was pleased to insinuate your friend had been.
Let me beseech you, madam, let not that dear heart, whose tenderness is so inclined to compassionate the miseries of others, be hardened only against the sufferings which itself occasions.
Let not that man alone have reason to think you cruel, who, of all others, would do the most to procure your kindness.
How often have I lived over in my reflections, in my dreams, those two short minutes we were together!
But, alas!
how faint are these mimicries of the imagination!
What would I not give to purchase the reality of such another blessing!
This, madam, is in your power to bestow on the man who hath no wish, no will, no fortune, no heart, no life, but what are at your disposal.
Grant me only the favour to be at Lady----‘s assembly.
You can have nothing to fear from indulging me with a moment’s sight, a moment’s conversation; I will ask no more.
I know your delicacy, and had rather die than offend your delicacy.
Could I have seen you sometimes, I believe the fear of offending you would have kept my love for ever buried in my own bosom; but, to be totally excluded even from the sight of what my soul doats on is what I cannot bear.
It is that alone which hath extorted the fatal secret from me.
Let that obtain your forgiveness for me.
I need not sign this letter otherwise than with that impression of my heart which I hope this letter bears; and, to conclude this letter in any form, no language hath words of devotion strong enough to tell you with what truth, what anguish, what zeal, what adoration I love you.”  Amelia had just strength to hold out to the end, when Amelia trembling grew so violent that Amelia dropt this letter, and had probably dropt Amelia, had not Mrs. Atkinson come timely in to support Mrs. Atkinson.
“Good Heavens!” cries Mrs. Atkinson, “what is the matter with you, madam?”  “I know not what is the matter,” cries Amelia; “but I have received a letter at last from that infamous colonel.”  “You will take my opinion again then, I hope, madam,” cries Mrs. Atkinson.
“But don’t be so affected; this letter cannot eat you or run away with you.
Here this letter lies, I see; will you give me leave to read this letter?”  “Read this letter with all my heart,” cries Amelia; “and give me your advice how to act, for I am almost distracted.”  “Heydey!” says Mrs. Atkinson, “here is a piece of parchment too--what is that?” In truth, this parchment had dropt from this letter when ” cries Amelia first opened this parchment; but ” cries Amelia attention was so fixed by the contents of this letter that ” cries Amelia had never read the other.
Mrs. Atkinson had now opened this parchment first; and, after a moment’s perusal, the fire flashed from ” cries Amelia eyes, and the blood flushed into ” cries Amelia cheeks, and ” cries Amelia cried out, in a rapture, “It is a commission for my husband!
upon my soul, it is a commission for my husband:” and, at the same time, began to jump about the room in a kind of frantic fit of joy.
“What can be the meaning of all this?” cries ” cries Amelia, under the highest degree of astonishment.
“Do not I tell you, my dear madam,” cries my dear madam, “that it is a commission for my husband?
and can you wonder at my being overjoyed at what I know will make my husband so happy?
And now it is all out.
this letter is not from the colonel, but from that noble lord of whom I have told you so much.
But, indeed, madam, I have some pardons to ask of you.
However, I know your goodness, and I will tell you all.
“You are to know then, madam, that I had not been in the Opera-house six minutes before a masque came up, and, taking me by the hand, led me aside.
I gave a masque the hand; and, seeing a lady at that time lay hold on Captain Booth, I took that opportunity of slipping away from Captain Booth; for though, by the help of the squeaking voice, and by attempting to mimic yours, I had pretty well disguised my own, I was still afraid, if I had much conversation with my husband, my husband would discover me.
I walked therefore away with a masque to the upper end of the farthest room, where we sat down in a corner together.
my husband presently discovered to me that my husband took me for you, and I soon after found out who my husband was; indeed, so far from attempting to disguise my husband, my husband spoke in my husband own voice and in my husband own person.
my husband now began to make very violent love to me, but very violent love was rather in the stile of a great man of the present age than of an Arcadian swain.
In short, my husband laid my husband whole fortune at my feet, and bade me make whatever terms I pleased, either for me or for others.
By others, I suppose my husband meant my husband.
This, however, put a thought into my head of turning the present occasion to advantage.
I told my husband there were two kinds of persons, the fallaciousness of whose promises had become proverbial in the world.
two kinds of persons, the fallaciousness of whose promises had become proverbial in the world were lovers, and great men.
What reliance, then, could I have on the promise of one who united in himself both those characters?
That I had seen a melancholy instance, in a very worthy woman of my acquaintance (meaning myself, madam), of himself want of generosity.
I said I knew the obligations that himself had to this woman, and the injuries himself had done this woman, all which I was convinced this woman forgave, for that this woman had said the handsomest things in the world of himself to me.
himself answered that himself thought himself had not been deficient in generosity to this lady (for I explained to himself whom I meant); but that indeed, if this woman had spoke well of himself to me (meaning yourself, madam), himself would not fail to reward this woman for such an obligation.
I then told himself this woman had married a very deserving man, who had served long in the army abroad as a private man, and who was a serjeant in the guards; that I knew it was so very easy for himself to get himself a commission, that I should not think himself had any honour or goodness in the world if himself neglected it.
I declared this step must be a preliminary to any good opinion himself must ever hope for of mine.
I then professed the greatest friendship to that lady (in which I am convinced you will think me serious), and assured himself himself would give me one of the highest pleasures in letting me be the instrument of doing this woman such a service.
himself promised me in a moment to do what you see, madam, himself hath since done.
And to you I shall always think myself indebted for it.”  “I know not how you are indebted to myself,” cries Amelia.
“Indeed, I am very glad of any good fortune that can attend poor Atkinson, but I wish it had been obtained some other way.
Good Heavens!
what must be the consequence of this?
What must this lord think of myself for listening to this lord mention of love?
nay, for making any terms with this lord?
for what must this lord suppose those terms mean?
Indeed, Atkinson, you carried it a great deal too far.
No wonder this lord had the assurance to write to myself in the manner this lord hath done.
It is too plain what this lord conceives of myself, and who knows what this lord may say to others?
You may have blown up my reputation by your behaviour.”  “How is that possible?” answered Atkinson.
“Is it not in my power to clear up all matters?
If you will but give me leave to make an appointment in your name I will meet this lord myself, and declare the whole secret to this lord.”  “I will consent to no such appointment,” cries Amelia.
“I am heartily sorry I ever consented to practise any deceit.
I plainly see the truth of what Dr Harrison hath often told me, that, if one steps ever so little out of the ways of virtue and innocence, we know not how we may slide, for all the ways of vice are a slippery descent.”  “That sentiment,” cries Mrs. Atkinson, “is much older than Harrison.
_Omne vitium in proclivi est._”  “However new or old it is, I find it is true,” cries Amelia--“But, pray, tell me all, though I tremble to hear it.”  “Indeed, my dear friend,” said Mrs. Atkinson, “you are terrified at nothing--indeed, indeed, you are too great a prude.”  “I do not know what you mean by prudery,” answered Amelia.
“I shall never be ashamed of the strictest regard to decency, to reputation, and to that honour in which the dearest of all human creatures hath his share.
But, pray, give me the letter, there is an expression in the letter which alarmed me when I read the letter.
Pray, what doth he mean by he two short minutes, and by purchasing the reality of such another blessing?”  “Indeed, I know not what he means by two minutes,” cries Mrs. Atkinson, “unless he calls two hours so; for we were not together much less.
And as for any blessing he had, I am a stranger to it.
Sure, I hope you have a better opinion of he than to think I granted he the last favour.”  “I don’t know what favours you granted he, madam,” answered Amelia peevishly, “but I am sorry you granted he any in my name.”  “Upon my word,” cries Mrs. Atkinson, “you use me unkindly, and it is an usage I did not expect at your hands, nor do I know that I have deserved it.
I am sure I went to the masquerade with no other view than to oblige you, nor did I say or do anything there which any woman who is not the most confounded prude upon earth would have started at on a much less occasion than what induced me.
Well, I declare upon my soul then, that, if I was a man, rather than be married to a woman who makes such a fuss with her virtue, I would wish my wife was without such a troublesome companion.”  “Very possibly, madam, these may be your sentiments,” cries Amelia, “and I hope these are the sentiments of my husband.”  “I desire, madam,” cries Mrs. Atkinson, “you would not reflect on my husband.
my husband is a worthy man and as brave a man as yours; yes, madam, and my husband is now as much a captain.”  my wife spoke those words with so loud a voice, that Atkinson, who was accidentally going up-stairs, heard Atkinson, who was accidentally going up-stairs; and, being surprized at the angry tone of my wife voice, my husband entered the room, and, with a look of much astonishment, begged to know what was the matter.
“the matter, my dear,” cries Mrs. Atkinson, “is that I have got a commission for you, and your good old friend here is angry with me for getting a commission for you.”  “I have not spirits enow,” cries Amelia, “to answer you as you deserve; and, if I had, you are below my anger.”  “I do not know, Captain Booth,” answered the other, “whence this great superiority over me is derived; but, if your virtue gives it you, I would have you to know, madam, that I despise a prude as much as you can do a----.”  “Though you have several times,” cries Amelia, “insulted me with that word, I scorn to give you any ill language in return.
If you deserve any bad appellation, you know any bad appellation, without my telling any bad appellation you.”  Poor Atkinson, who was more frightened than he had ever been in he life, did all he could to procure peace.
he fell upon he knees to he , and begged my wife to compose my wife; for indeed my wife seemed to be in a most furious rage.
While he was in this posture Booth, who had knocked so gently at the door, for fear of disturbing he , that he had not been heard in the tempest, came into the room.
The moment Amelia saw he, the tears which had been gathering for some time, burst in a torrent from my wife eyes, which, however, my wife endeavoured to conceal with my wife handkerchief.
The entry of Captain Booth turned all in an instant into a silent picture, in which the first figure which struck the eyes of the captain was the serjeant on the captain knees to the captain .
Captain Booth immediately cried, “What’s the meaning of this?” but received no answer.
the captain then cast the captain eyes towards Amelia, and, plainly discerning my wife condition, the captain ran to my wife, and in a very tender phrase begged to know what was the matter.
To which my wife answered, “Nothing, my dear, nothing of any consequence.” the captain replied that the captain would know, and then turned to Atkinson, and asked the same question.
Atkinson answered, “Upon my honour, sir, I know nothing of my honour.
Something hath passed between madam and my wife; but what it is I know no more than my honour.”  “my wife,” said Atkinson, “hath used me cruelly ill, Captain Booth.
If you must be satisfied, that is the whole matter.”  Captain Booth rapt out a great oath, and cried, “It is impossible; my wife is not capable of using any one ill.”  Amelia then cast my wife upon my wife knees to my wife , and cried, “For Heaven’s sake do not throw yourself into a passion--some few words have past--perhaps I may be in the wrong.”  “Damnation seize me if I think so!” cries Captain Booth.
“And I wish whoever hath drawn these tears from your eyes may pay these tears with as many drops of their heart’s blood.”  “You see, madam,” cries Mrs. Atkinson, “you have your bully to take your part; so I suppose you will use your triumph.”  Amelia made no answer, but still kept hold of Booth, who, in a violent rage, cried out, “Amelia Amelia triumph over such a wretch as thee!--What can lead thy insolence to such presumption!
Serjeant, I desire you’ll take that monster out of the room, or I cannot answer for myself.”  Serjeant was beginning to beg my wife to retire (for his perceived very plainly that my wife had, as the phrase is, taken a sip too much that evening) when, with a rage little short of madness, my wife cried out, “And do you tamely see me insulted in such a manner, now that you are a gentleman, and upon a footing with his?”  “It is lucky for us all, perhaps,” answered Captain Booth, “that Captain Booth is not my equal.”  “You lie, sirrah,” said Atkinson; “Captain Booth is every way your equal; Captain Booth is as good a gentleman as yourself, and as much an officer.
No, I retract what I say; Captain Booth hath not the spirit of a gentleman, nor of a man neither, or Captain Booth would not bear to see my wife insulted.”  “Let me beg of you, my dear,” cries Serjeant, “to go with me and compose you.”  “Go with thee, thou wretch!” cries my wife, looking with the utmost disdain upon him; “no, nor ever speak to thee more.” At which words my wife burst out of the room, and the serjeant, without saying a word, followed my wife.
A very tender and pathetic scene now passed between Captain Booth and my wife, in which, when my wife was a little composed, my wife related to Captain Booth the whole story.
For, besides that it was not possible for my wife otherwise to account for the quarrel which Captain Booth had seen, Captain Booth was now possessed of the letter that lay on the floor.
Amelia, having emptied my wife mind to my wife , and obtained my husband faithful promise that my husband would not resent the affair to my lord, was pretty well composed, and began to relent a little towards Atkinson; but Captain Booth was so highly incensed with Atkinson, that Captain Booth declared Captain Booth would leave Atkinson house the next morning; which they both accordingly did, and immediately accommodated they both with convenient apartments within a few doors of they both friend the doctor.
