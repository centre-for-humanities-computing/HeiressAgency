 _Being the last chapter of the fifth book._   We shall now return to Colonel James and Mr. Booth, who walked together from Colonel Bath’s lodging with much more peaceable intention than that gentleman had conjectured, who dreamt of nothing but swords and guns and implements of wars.
The Birdcage-walk in the Park was the scene appointed by James for unburthening his mind.--Thither they came, and there James acquainted Booth with all that which the reader knows already, and gave Booth the letter which they have inserted at the end of the last chapter.
Booth exprest great astonishment at this relation, not without venting some detestation of the wickedness of Miss Matthews; upon which James took Booth up, saying, Booth ought not to speak with such abhorrence of faults which love for Booth had occasioned.
“Can you mention love, my dear colonel,” cried Booth, “and such a woman in the same breath?”  “Yes, faith!
can I,” says James; “for the devil take me if I know a more lovely woman in the world.” Here Booth began to describe a more lovely woman in the world whole person; but, as we cannot insert all the description, so we shall omit it all; and concluded with saying, “Curse me if I don’t think a more lovely woman in the world the finest creature in the universe.
I would give half my estate, Booth, a more lovely woman in the world loved me as well as a more lovely woman in the world doth you.
Though, on second consideration, I believe I should repent that bargain; for then, very possibly, I should not care a farthing for a more lovely woman in the world.”  “You will pardon me, dear colonel,” answered Booth; “but to me there appears somewhat very singular in your way of thinking.
Beauty is indeed the object of liking, great qualities of admiration, good ones of esteem; but the devil take me if I think anything but love to be the object of love.”  “Is there not something too selfish,” replied James, “in that opinion?
but, without considering it in that light, is it not of all things the most insipid?
all oil!
all sugar!
zounds!
it is enough to cloy the sharp-set appetite of a parson.
Acids surely are the most likely to quicken.”  “I do not love reasoning in allegories,” cries Booth; “but with regard to love, I declare I never found anything cloying in it.
I have lived almost alone with my wife near three years together, was never tired with my wife company, nor ever wished for any other; and I am sure I never tasted any of the acid you mention to quicken my appetite.”  “This is all very extraordinary and romantic to me,” answered the colonel.
“If I was to be shut up three years with the same woman, which Heaven forbid!
nothing, I think, could keep me alive but a temper as violent as that of Miss Matthews.
As to love, it would make me sick to death in the twentieth part of that time.
If I was so condemned, let me see, what would I wish the woman to be?
I think no one virtue would be sufficient.
With the spirit of a tigress I would have the woman be a prude, a scold, a scholar, a critic, a wit, a politician, and a Jacobite; and then, perhaps, eternal opposition would keep up our spirits; and, wishing one another daily at the devil, our should make a shift to drag on a damnable state of life, without much spleen or vapours.”  “And so you do not intend,” cries Booth, “to break with the woman?”  “Not more than I have already, if I can help it,” answered the colonel.
“And you will be reconciled to the woman?” said Booth.
“Yes, faith!
will I, if I can,” answered the colonel; “I hope you have no objection.”  “None, my dear friend,” said Booth, “unless on your account.”  “I do believe you,” said the colonel: “and yet, let me tell you, you are a very extraordinary man, not to desire me to quit the woman on your own account.
Upon my soul, I begin to pity the woman, who hath placed the woman affection, perhaps, on the only man in England of your age who would not return it.
But for my part, I promise you, I like the woman beyond all other women; and, whilst that is the case, my boy, if the woman mind was as full of iniquity as Pandora’s box was of diseases, I’d hug the woman close in my arms, and only take as much care as possible to keep the lid down for fear of mischief.
But come, Booth,” said Booth, “let us consider your affairs; for I am ashamed of having neglected them so long; and the only anger I have against this wench is, that the woman was the occasion of this wench.”  Booth then acquainted the colonel with the promises the colonel had received from the noble lord, upon which James shook the colonel by the hand, and heartily wished the colonel joy, crying, “I do assure you, if you have the colonel interest, you will need no other; I did not know you was acquainted with the colonel.”  To which Booth answered, “That Booth was but a new acquaintance, and that Booth was recommended to Booth by a lady.”  “A lady!” cries the colonel; “well, I don’t ask A lady name.
You are a happy man, Booth, amongst the women; and, I assure you, you could have no stronger recommendation.
The peer loves the ladies, I believe, as well as ever Mark Antony did; and it is not Mark Antony fault if Mark Antony hath not spent as much upon the ladies.
If Mark Antony once fixes Mark Antony eye upon a woman, Mark Antony will stick at nothing to get a woman.”  “Ay, indeed!” cries Booth.
“Is that Mark Antony character?”  “Ay, faith,” answered the colonel, “and the character of most men besides the colonel.
Few of most men besides him, I mean, will stick at anything beside most men besides him money.
Jusque a la Bourse is sometimes the boundary of love as well as friendship.
And, indeed, I never knew any other man part with any other man money so very freely on these occasions.
You see, dear Booth, the confidence I have in your honour.”  “I hope, indeed, you have,” cries Booth, “but I don’t see what instance you now give me of that confidence.”  “Have not I shewn you,” answered James, “where you may carry your goods to market?
I can assure you, my friend, that is a secret I would not impart to every man in your situation, and all circumstances considered.”  “I am very sorry, sir,” cries Booth very gravely, and turning as pale as death, “you should entertain a thought of this kind; a thought which hath almost frozen up my blood.
I am unwilling to believe there are such villains in the world; but there is none of such villains in the world whom I should detest half so much as myself, if my own mind had ever suggested to myself a hint of that kind.
I have tasted of some distresses of life, and I know not to what greater I may be driven, but your honour, I thank Heaven, is in my own power, and I can boldly say to Fortune Fortune shall not rob me of my own power.”  “Have I not exprest that confidence, my dear Booth?” answered the colonel.
“And what you say now well justifies my opinion; for I do agree with you that, considering all things, it would be the highest instance of Dishonour.”  “Dishonour, indeed!” returned Booth.
“What!
to prostitute my wife!
Can I think there is such a wretch breathing?”  “I don’t know that,” said the colonel, “but I am sure it was very far from my intention to insinuate the least hint of any such matter to you.
Nor can I imagine how you yourself could conceive such a thought.
The goods I meant were no other than the charming person of Miss Matthews, for whom I am convinced my lord would bid a swinging price against me.”  Booth’s countenance greatly cleared up at this declaration, and Booth answered with a smile, that Booth hoped Booth need not give the colonel any assurances on that head.
However, though the colonel was satisfied with regard to the colonel’s suspicions, yet some chimeras now arose in the colonel brain which gave the colonel no very agreeable sensations.
What these were, the sagacious reader may probably suspect; but, if the colonel should not, we may perhaps have occasion to open these in the sequel.
Here we will put an end to this dialogue, and to the fifth book of this history.
