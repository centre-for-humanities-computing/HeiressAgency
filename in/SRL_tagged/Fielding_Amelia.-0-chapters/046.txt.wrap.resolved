 _Containing much heroic matter._   At the end of three days Mrs. Ellison’s friend had so far purchased Mr. Booth’s liberty that Mr. Booth could walk again abroad within the verge without any danger of having a warrant backed against Mr. Booth by the board before Mr. Booth had notice. As for the ill-looked persons that had given the alarm, it was now discovered that another unhappy gentleman, and not Booth, was the object of the ill-looked persons that had given the alarm pursuit.  Mr. Booth, now being delivered from Mr. Booth fears, went, as Mr. Booth had formerly done, to take Mr. Booth morning walk in the Park. Here Mr. Booth met Colonel Bath in company with some other officers, and very civilly paid Mr. Booth respects to Mr. Booth. But, instead of returning the salute, Colonel Bath in company looked Mr. Booth full in the face with a very stern countenance; and, if Mr. Booth could be said to take any notice of Mr. Booth, it was in such a manner as to inform Mr. Booth Mr. Booth would take no notice of Mr. Booth.  Mr. Booth was not more hurt than surprized at this behaviour, and resolved to know the reason of it. Mr. Booth therefore watched an opportunity till Colonel Bath in company was alone, and then walked boldly up to Mr. Booth, and desired to know if Colonel Bath in company had given Mr. Booth any offence? Colonel Bath in company answered hastily, Mr. Booth, I am above being offended with you, nor do I think it consistent with my dignity to make you any answer.” Mr. Booth replied, “I don’t know, Mr. Booth, that I have done anything to deserve this treatment.” “Look’ee, sir,” cries Colonel Bath in company, “if I had not formerly had some respect for Colonel Bath in company, I should not think you worth my resentment. However, as you are a gentleman born, and an officer, and as I have had an esteem for you, I will give you some marks of it by putting it in your power to do you justice. I will tell you therefore, Mr. Booth, that you have acted like a scoundrel.” “If we were not in the Park,” answered Mr. Booth warmly, “I would thank you very properly for that compliment.” “O, Mr. Booth,” cries Colonel Bath in company, “we can be soon in a convenient place.” Upon which Mr. Booth answered, Mr. Booth would attend Mr. Booth wherever Mr. Booth pleased. Colonel Bath in company then bid Mr. Booth come along, and strutted forward directly up Constitution-hill to Hyde-park, Mr. Booth following Mr. Booth at first, and afterwards walking before Mr. Booth, till they came to that place which may be properly called the field of blood, being that part, a little to the left of the ring, which heroes have chosen for the scene of heroes exit out of this world.  Mr. Booth reached the ring some time before Colonel Bath in company; for Colonel Bath in company mended not Colonel Bath in company pace any more than a Spaniard. To say truth, I believe it was not in Colonel Bath in company power: for Colonel Bath in company had so long accustomed Colonel Bath in company to one and the same strut, that as a horse, used always to trotting, can scarce be forced into a gallop, so could no passion force Colonel Bath in company to alter Colonel Bath in company pace.  [Illustration with caption: _Colonel Bath._]  At length, however, both parties arrived at the lists, where Colonel Bath in company very deliberately took off Colonel Bath in company wig and coat, and laid both parties on the grass, and then, drawing Colonel Bath in company sword, advanced to Booth, who had likewise Colonel Bath in company drawn weapon in Colonel Bath in company hand, but had made no other preparation for the combat.  The combatants now engaged with great fury, and, after two or three passes, Booth run Colonel Bath in company through the body and threw Colonel Bath in company on the ground, at the same time possessing Colonel Bath in company of the colonel’s sword.  As soon as Colonel Bath in company was become master of Colonel Bath in company speech, Colonel Bath in company called out to Booth in a very kind voice, and said, “You have done my business, and satisfied me that you are a man of honour, and that my brother James must have been mistaken; for I am convinced that no man who will draw my brother James sword in so gallant a manner is capable of being a rascal. D--n me, give me a buss, my dear boy; I ask your pardon for that infamous appellation I dishonoured your dignity with; but d--n me if it was not purely out of love, and to give you an opportunity of doing yourself justice, which I own you have done like a man of honour. What may be the consequence I know not, but I hope, at least, I shall live to reconcile you with my brother James.”  Booth shewed great concern, and even horror in Booth countenance. “Why, my dear colonel,” said my dear colonel, “would you force me to this? for Heaven’s sake tell me what I have ever done to offend you.”  “Me!” cried my dear colonel. “Indeed, my dear child, you never did anything to offend me.--Nay, I have acted the part of a friend to you in the whole affair. I maintained your cause with my brother James as long as decency would permit; I could not flatly contradict my brother James, though, indeed, I scarce believed my brother James. But what could I do? If I had not fought with you, I must have been obliged to have fought with my brother James; however, I hope what is done will be sufficient, and that matters may be discomodated without your being put to the necessity of fighting any more on this occasion.”  “Never regard me,” cried Booth eagerly; “for Heaven’s sake, think of your own preservation. Let me put you into a chair, and get you a surgeon.”  “Thou art a noble lad,” cries the colonel, who was now got on my brother James legs, “and I am glad the business is so well over; for, though your sword went quite through, your sword slanted so that I apprehend there is little danger of life: however, I think there is enough done to put an honourable end to the whole affair, especially as you was so hasty to disarm me. I bleed a little, but I can walk to the house by the water; and, if you will send me a chair thither, I shall be obliged to you.”  As the colonel refused any assistance (indeed the colonel was very able to walk without it, though with somewhat less dignity than usual), Booth set forward to Grosvenor-gate, in order to procure the chair, and soon after returned with one to the colonel friend; whom having conveyed into it, the colonel attended the colonel on foot into Bond-street, where then lived a very eminent surgeon.  a very eminent surgeon, turned towards Booth, who was apparently the guilty person, and said, with a smile, “Upon my word, Sir, you have performed the business with great dexterity.”  “Sir,” cries the colonel to a very eminent surgeon, “I would not have you imagine I am afraid to die. I think I know more what belongs to the dignity of a man; and, I believe, I have shewn it at the head of a line of battle. Do not impute my concern to that fear, when I ask you whether there is or is not any danger?”  “Really, colonel,” answered the surgeon, who well knew the complexion of the gentleman then under the gentleman hands, “it would appear like presumption to say that a man who hath been just run through the body is in no manner of danger. But this I think I may assure you, that I yet perceive no very bad symptoms, and, unless something worse should appear, or a fever be the consequence, I hope you may live to be again, with all your dignity, at the head of a line of battle.”  “I am glad to hear that is your opinion,” quoth the colonel, “for I am not desirous of dying, though I am not afraid of it. But, if anything worse than you apprehend should happen, I desire you will be a witness of my declaration that this young gentleman is entirely innocent. I forced this young gentleman to do what this young gentleman did. My dear Booth, I am pleased matters are as they are. You are the first man that ever gained an advantage over I; but it was very lucky for My dear Booth that you disarmed me, and I doubt not but you have the equananimity to think so. If the business, therefore, hath ended without doing anything to the purpose, it was Fortune’s pleasure, and neither of our faults.”  My dear Booth heartily embraced the colonel, and assured My dear Booth of the great satisfaction My dear Booth had received from the surgeon’s opinion; and soon after the two combatants took the two combatants leave of each other. the colonel, after the colonel was drest, went in a chair to the colonel lodgings, and My dear Booth walked on foot to the colonel; where the colonel luckily arrived without meeting any of Mr. Murphy’s gang; a danger which never once occurred to the colonel imagination till the colonel was out of it.  The affair the colonel had been about had indeed so entirely occupied the colonel mind, that The affair he had been about had obliterated every other idea; among the rest, The affair he had been about caused the colonel so absolutely to forget the time of the day, that, though the colonel had exceeded the time of dining above two hours, the colonel had not the least suspicion of being at home later than usual.
