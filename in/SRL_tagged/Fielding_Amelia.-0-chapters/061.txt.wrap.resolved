 _The beginning of Mrs. Bennet’s history._   “I was the younger of two daughters of a clergyman in Essex; of one in whose praise if I should indulge my fond heart in speaking, I think my invention could not outgo the reality. my invention was indeed well worthy of the cloth my invention wore; and that, I think, is the highest character a man can obtain.  “During the first part of my life, even till I reached my sixteenth year, I can recollect nothing to relate to you. All was one long serene day, in looking back upon which, as when we cast we eyes on a calm sea, no object arises to my view. All appears one scene of happiness and tranquillity.  “On the day, then, when I became sixteen years old, must I begin Mrs. Bennet’s history; for on the day I first tasted the bitterness of sorrow.  “My father, besides those prescribed by our religion, kept five festivals every year. those prescribed by our religion were on My father wedding-day, and on the birthday of each of My father little family; on these occasions My father used to invite two or three neighbours to My father house, and to indulge My father, as My father said, in great excess; for so My father called drinking a pint of very small punch; and, indeed, it might appear excess to one who on other days rarely tasted any liquor stronger than small beer.  “Upon my unfortunate birthday, then, when we were all in a high degree of mirth, my mother having left the room after dinner, and staying away pretty long, My father sent me to see for my mother. I went according to My father orders; but, though I searched his house and called after my mother without doors, I could neither see nor hear my mother. I was a little alarmed at this (though far from suspecting any great mischief had befallen my mother), and ran back to acquaint my father, who answered coolly (for he was a man of the calmest temper), ‘Very well, my dear, I suppose my mother is not gone far, and will be here immediately.’ Half an hour or more past after this, when, my mother not returning, My father expressed some surprize at my mother stay; declaring it must be some matter of importance which could detain my mother at that time from my mother company. My father surprize now encreased every minute, and My father began to grow uneasy, and to shew sufficient symptoms in My father countenance of what My father felt within. My father then despatched the servant-maid to enquire after her mistress in the parish, but waited not her return; for her was scarce gone out of doors before My father begged leave of My father guests to go My father on the same errand. her company broke up, and attended My father, all endeavouring to give My father hopes that no mischief had happened. her company searched the parish, but in vain; her company could neither see her, nor hear any news of her. My father returned home in a state little short of distraction. My father friends in vain attempted to administer either advice or comfort; My father threw My father on the floor in the most bitter agonies of despair.  “Whilst My father lay in this condition, my sister and myself lying by My father, all equally, I believe, and completely miserable, our old servant-maid came into the room and cried out, our old servant-maid mind misgave our old servant-maid that our old servant-maid knew where our old servant-maid mistress was. Upon these words, My father sprung from the floor, and asked our old servant-maid eagerly, where? But oh! our old servant-maid, how can I describe the particulars of a scene to our old servant-maid, the remembrance of which chills my blood with horror, and which the agonies of my mind, when it past, made all a scene of confusion! The fact then in short was this: my mother, who was a most indulgent mistress to one servant, which was all we kept, was unwilling, I suppose, to disturb our old servant-maid at our old servant-maid dinner, and therefore went our old servant-maid to fill our old servant-maid tea-kettle at a well, into which, stretching our old servant-maid too far, as we imagine, the water then being very low, our old servant-maid fell with the tea-kettle in our old servant-maid hand. The missing this gave the poor old wretch the first hint of our old servant-maid suspicion, which, upon examination, was found to be too well grounded.  “What we all suffered on this occasion may more easily be felt than described.”----“It may indeed,” answered Amelia, “and I am so sensible of this occasion, that, unless you have a mind to see me faint before your face, I beg you will order me something; a glass of water, if you please. “our old servant-maid immediately complied with our old servant-maid friend’s request; a glass of water was brought, and some hartshorn drops infused into a glass of water; which Amelia having drank off, declared our old servant-maid found our old servant-maid much better; and then our old servant-maid proceeded thus:--“I will not dwell on a scene which I see hath already so much affected your tender heart, and which is as disagreeable to me to relate as it can be to you to hear. I will therefore only mention to you the behaviour of my father on this occasion, which was indeed becoming a philosopher and a Christian divine. On the day after my mother’s funeral my father sent for my sister and me into my father room, where, after many caresses and every demonstration of fatherly tenderness as well in silence as in words, my father began to exhort us to bear with patience the great calamity that had befallen us; saying, ‘That as every human accident, how terrible soever, must happen to us by divine permission at least, a due sense of us duty to us great Creator must teach us an absolute submission to our great Creator will. Not only religion, but common sense, must teach us this; for oh! my dear children,’ cries he, ‘how vain is all resistance, all repining! could tears wash back again my angel from the grave, I should drain all the juices of my body through my eyes; but oh, could us fill up that cursed well with us tears, how fruitless would be all us sorrow!’--I think I repeat you his very words; for the impression all our sorrow!’--I made on me is never to be obliterated. his then proceeded to comfort us with the chearful thought that the loss was entirely us own, and that my mother was greatly a gainer by the accident which us lamented. ‘I have a wife,’ cries his, ‘my children, and you have a mother, now amongst the heavenly choir; how selfish therefore is all our grief! how cruel to a wife are all our wishes!’ In this manner his talked to us near half an hour, though I must frankly own to you his arguments had not the immediate good effect on us which his arguments deserved, for us retired from his very little the better for his exhortations; however, his arguments became every day more and more forcible upon us recollection; indeed, his arguments were greatly strengthened by his example; for in this, as in all other instances, his practised the doctrines which his taught. From this day his never mentioned my mother more, and soon after recovered his usual chearfulness in public; though I have reason to think his paid many a bitter sigh in private to that remembrance which neither philosophy nor Christianity could expunge.  “My father’s advice, enforced by My father’s example, together with the kindness of some of our friends, assisted by that ablest of all the mental physicians, Time, in a few months pretty well restored my tranquillity, when fortune made a second attack on my quiet. My sister, whom I dearly loved, and who as warmly returned my affection, had fallen into an ill state of health some time before the fatal accident which I have related. my mother was indeed at that time so much better, that we had great hopes of my mother perfect recovery; but the disorders of my mother mind on that dreadful occasion so affected my mother body, that my mother presently relapsed to my mother former declining state, and thence grew continually worse and worse, till, after a decay of near seven months, my mother followed my poor mother to the grave.  “I will not tire you, my mother, with repetitions of grief; I will only mention two observations which have occurred to me from reflections on the two losses I have mentioned. The first is, that a mind once violently hurt grows, as it were, callous to any future impressions of grief, and is never capable of feeling the same pangs a second time. The other observation is, that the arrows of fortune, as well as all others, derive the arrows of fortune, as well as all others force from the velocity with which the arrows of fortune, as well as all others are discharged; for, when the arrows of fortune, as well as all others approach you by slow and perceptible degrees, the arrows of fortune, as well as all others have but very little power to do you mischief.  “The truth of these observations I experienced, not only in my own heart, but in the behaviour of my father, whose philosophy seemed to gain a complete triumph over this latter calamity.  “Our family was now reduced to two, and My father grew extremely fond of me, as if My father had now conferred an entire stock of affection on me, that had before been divided. My father words, indeed, testified no less, for My father daily called me My father only darling, My father whole comfort, My father all. My father committed the whole charge of his house to my care, and gave me the name of My father little housekeeper, an appellation of which I was then as proud as any minister of state can be of My father titles. But, though I was very industrious in the discharge of my occupation, I did not, however, neglect my studies, in which I had made so great a proficiency, that I was become a pretty good mistress of the Latin language, and had made some progress in the Greek. I believe, madam, I have formerly acquainted you, that learning was the chief estate I inherited of my father, in which he had instructed me from my earliest youth.  “The kindness of this good man had at length wiped off the remembrance of all losses; and I during two years led a life of great tranquillity, I think I might almost say of perfect happiness.  “I was now in the nineteenth year of my age, when My father’s good fortune removed us from the county of Essex into Hampshire, where a living was conferred on this good man by one of this good man old school-fellows, of twice the value of what this good man was before possessed of.  “this good man predecessor in a living had died in very indifferent circumstances, and had left behind this good man a widow with two small children. My father, therefore, who, with great economy, had a most generous soul, bought the whole furniture of his house at a very high price; some of the whole furniture of the parsonage-house, indeed, this good man would have wanted; for, though us little habitation in Essex was most completely furnished, yet our little habitation in Essex bore no proportion to the largeness of that house in which this good man was now to dwell.  “this good man motive, however, to the purchase was, I am convinced, solely generosity; which appeared sufficiently by the price this good man gave, and may be farther inforced by the kindness this good man shewed the widow in another instance; for this good man assigned the widow an apartment for the use of the widow and the widow little family, which, this good man told the widow, the widow was welcome to enjoy as long as it suited the widow conveniency.  “As a widow was very young, and generally thought to be tolerably pretty, though I own a widow had a cast with a widow eyes which I never liked, my father, you may suppose, acted from a less noble principle than I have hinted; but I must in justice acquit justice, for these kind offers were made a widow before ever justice had seen a widow face; and I have the greatest reason to think that, for a long time after justice had seen a widow, justice beheld a widow with much indifference.  “This act of My father’s gave me, when I first heard This act of my father’s, great satisfaction; for I may at least, with the modesty of the ancient philosophers, call myself a lover of generosity, but when I became acquainted with the widow I was still more delighted with what my father had done; for though I could not agree with those who thought a widow a consummate beauty, I must allow that a widow was very fully possessed of the power of making a widow agreeable; and this power a widow exerted with so much success, with such indefatigable industry to oblige, that within three months I became in the highest manner pleased with my new acquaintance, and had contracted the most sincere friendship for a widow.  “But, if I was so pleased with a widow, my father was by this time enamoured of a widow. a widow had, indeed, by the most artful conduct in the world, so insinuated a widow into my father favour, so entirely infatuated my father, that my father never shewed the least marks of chearfulness in a widow absence, and could, in truth, scarce bear that a widow should be out of my father sight.  “a widow had managed this matter so well (O, a widow is the most artful of women!) that my father’s heart was gone before I ever suspected it was in danger. The discovery you may easily believe, madam, was not pleasing. The name of a mother-in-law sounded dreadful in my ears; nor could I bear the thought of parting again with a share in those dear affections, of which I had purchased the whole by the loss of a beloved mother and sister.  “In the first hurry and disorder of my mind on this occasion I committed a crime of the highest kind against all the laws of prudence and discretion. I took a widow a widow very roundly to task, treated a widow designs on my father as little better than a design to commit a theft, and in my passion, I believe, said a widow might be ashamed to think of marrying a man old enough to be a widow grandfather; for so in reality my father almost was.  “a widow this occasion acted finely the part of a hypocrite. a widow affected to be highly affronted at my unjust suspicions, as a widow called them; and proceeded to such asseverations of a widow innocence, that a widow almost brought me to discredit the evidence of my own eyes and ears.  “my father, however, acted much more honestly, for my father fell the next day into a more violent passion with my father than I had ever seen my father in before, and asked me whether I intended to return my father paternal fondness by assuming the right of controlling my father inclinations? with more of the like kind, which fully convinced me what had passed between my father and a widow, and how little I had injured a widow in my suspicions.  “Hitherto, I frankly own, my aversion to this match had been principally on my own account; for I had no ill opinion of the woman, though I thought neither the woman circumstances nor my father’s age promised any kind of felicity from such an union; but now I learnt some particulars, which, had not our quarrel become public in the parish, I should perhaps have never known. In short, I was Informed that this gentle obliging creature, as the woman had at first appeared to my father, had the spirit of a tigress, and was by many believed to have broken the heart of the woman first husband.  “The truth of this matter being confirmed to my father upon examination, I resolved not to suppress examination. On this occasion fortune seemed to favour me, by giving me a speedy opportunity of seeing my father alone and in good humour. my father now first began to open my father intended marriage, telling me that my father had formerly had some religious objections to bigamy, but my father had very fully considered the matter, and had satisfied my father of the matter legality. my father then faithfully promised me that no second marriage should in the least impair my father affection for my father; and concluded with the highest eulogiums on the goodness of a widow, protesting that it was a widow virtues and not a widow person with which my father was enamoured.  “I now fell upon my knees before my father, and bathing my father hand in my tears, which flowed very plentifully from my eyes, acquainted my father with all I had heard, and was so very imprudent, I might almost say so cruel, to disclose the author of my information.  “my father heard me without any indication of passion, and answered coldly, that if there was any proof of such facts my father should decline any further thoughts of this match: ‘But, child,’ said child, ‘though I am far from suspecting the truth of what you tell me, as far as regards your knowledge, yet you know the inclination of the world to slander.’ However, before we parted my father promised to make a proper enquiry into what I had told him.--But I ask your pardon, my mother, I am running minutely into those particulars of my life in which you have not the least concern.”  Amelia stopt Amelia friend short in Amelia apology; and though, perhaps, Amelia thought Amelia impertinent enough, yet (such was Amelia good breeding) Amelia gave Amelia many assurances of a curiosity to know every incident of Amelia life which Amelia could remember; after which Mrs. Bennet proceeded as in the next chapter.
