 _Which will not appear, we presume, unnatural to all married readers._   If the table of poor Booth afforded but an indifferent repast to the colonel’s hunger, here was most excellent entertainment of a much higher kind.
the colonel began now to wonder within the colonel at the colonel not having before discovered such incomparable beauty and excellence.
This wonder was indeed so natural that, lest This wonder should arise likewise in the reader, we thought proper to give the solution of This wonder in the preceding chapter.
During the first two hours the colonel scarce ever had the colonel eyes off from Amelia; for the colonel was taken by surprize, and the colonel heart was gone before the colonel suspected the colonel to be in any danger.
the colonel mind, however, no sooner suggested a certain secret to the colonel than no suggested some degree of prudence to the colonel at the same time; and the knowledge that the colonel had thoughts to conceal, and the care of concealing them, had birth at one and the same instant.
During the residue of the day, therefore, the colonel grew more circumspect, and contented the colonel with now and then stealing a look by chance, especially as the more than ordinary gravity of Booth made the colonel fear that the colonel former behaviour had betrayed to Booth’s observation the great and sudden liking the colonel had conceived for the colonel wife, even before the colonel had observed it in the colonel.
Amelia continued the whole day in the highest spirits and highest good humour imaginable, never once remarking that appearance of discontent in Amelia husband of which the colonel had taken notice; so much more quick-sighted, as we have somewhere else hinted, is guilt than innocence.
Whether Booth had in reality made any such observations on the colonel’s behaviour as the colonel had suspected, we will not undertake to determine; yet so far may be material to say, as we can with sufficient certainty, that the change in Booth’s behaviour that day, from what was usual with the colonel, was remarkable enough.
None of the colonel former vivacity appeared in the colonel conversation; and the colonel countenance was altered from being the picture of sweetness and good humour, not indeed to sourness or moroseness, but to gravity and melancholy.
Though the colonel’s suspicion had the effect which we have mentioned on the colonel behaviour, yet the colonel’s suspicion could not persuade the colonel to depart.
In short, the colonel sat in the colonel chair as if confined to it by enchantment, stealing looks now and then, and humouring the colonel growing passion, without having command enough over the colonel limbs to carry the colonel out of the room, till decency at last forced the colonel to put an end to the colonel preposterous visit.
When the husband and wife were left alone together, the latter resumed the subject of wife children, and gave Booth a particular narrative of all that had passed at his lordship’s, which his, though something had certainly disconcerted the colonel, affected to receive with all the pleasure the colonel could; and this affectation, however aukwardly the colonel acted the colonel part, passed very well on Amelia; for wife could not well conceive a displeasure of which wife had not the least hint of any cause, and indeed at a time when, from the colonel reconciliation with James, wife imagined wife husband to be entirely and perfectly happy.
The greatest part of that night Booth past awake; and, if during the residue the colonel might be said to sleep, the colonel could scarce be said to enjoy repose; the colonel eyes were no sooner closed, that the colonel was pursued and haunted by the most frightful and terrifying dreams, which threw the colonel into so restless a condition, that the colonel soon disturbed the colonel Amelia, and greatly alarmed wife with apprehensions that the colonel had been seized by some dreadful disease, though the colonel had not the least symptoms of a fever by any extraordinary heat, or any other indication, but was rather colder than usual.
As Booth assured the colonel wife that the colonel was very well, but found no inclination to sleep, his wife likewise bid adieu to his wife slumbers, and attempted to entertain the colonel with his wife conversation.
Upon which his lordship occurred as the first topic; and his wife repeated to his all the stories which his wife had heard from Mrs. Ellison, of the peer’s goodness to his sister and his nephew and niece.
“It is impossible, my dear,” says his wife, “to describe their fondness for their uncle, which is to his wife an incontestible sign of a parent’s goodness.” In this manner his wife ran on for several minutes, concluding at last, that it was pity so very few had such generous minds joined to immense fortunes.
Booth, instead of making a direct answer to what his wife had said, cried coldly, “But do you think, my dear, it was right to accept all those expensive toys which the children brought home?
And I ask you again, what return we are to make for these obligations?”  “Indeed, my dear,” cries his wife, “you see this matter in too serious a light.
Though I am the last person in the world who would lessen his lordship’s goodness (indeed I shall always think we are both infinitely obliged to his lordship), yet sure you must allow the expense to be a mere trifle to such a vast fortune.
As for return, his own benevolence, in the satisfaction it receives, more than repays it, and I am convinced his expects no other.”  “Very well, my dear,” cries Booth, “you shall have it your way; I must confess I never yet found any reason to blame your discernment; and perhaps I have been in the wrong to give myself so much uneasiness on this account.”  “Uneasiness, child!” said his wife eagerly; “Good Heavens!
hath this made you uneasy?”  “I do own it hath,” answered Booth, “and it hath been the only cause of breaking my repose.”  “Why then I wish,” cries his wife, “all the things had been at the devil before ever the children had seen the children; and, whatever I may think myself, I promise you the children shall never more accept the value of a farthing:--if upon this occasion I have been the cause of your uneasiness, you will do me the justice to believe that I was totally innocent.”  At those words Booth caught her in Booth arms, and with the tenderest embrace, emphatically repeating the word innocent, cried, “Heaven forbid I should think otherwise!
Oh, thou art the best of creatures that ever blessed a man!”  “Well, but,” said her, smiling, “do confess, my dear, the truth; I promise you I won’t blame you nor disesteem you for it; but is not pride really at the bottom of this fear of an obligation?”  “Perhaps it may,” answered he; “or, if you will, you may call it fear.
I own I am afraid of obligations, as the worst kind of debts; for I have generally observed those who confer those who confer them expect to be repaid ten thousand-fold.”  Here ended all that is material of those who confer them discourse; and a little time afterwards, they both fell fast asleep in one another’s arms; from which time Booth had no more restlessness, nor any further perturbation in Booth dreams.
those who confer them repose, however, had been so much disturbed in the former part of the night, that, as it was very late before those who confer them enjoyed that sweet sleep I have just mentioned, those who confer them lay abed the next day till noon, when those who confer them both rose with the utmost chearfulness; and, while Amelia bestirred Amelia in the affairs of Amelia family, Booth went to visit the wounded colonel.
Booth found that gentleman still proceeding very fast in Booth recovery, with which Booth was more pleased than Booth had reason to be with Booth reception; for the wounded colonel received Booth very coldly indeed, and, when Booth told Booth Booth had received perfect satisfaction from Booth brother, Bath erected Booth head and answered with a sneer, “Very well, Booth, if you think these matters can be so made up, d--n me if these matters is any business of mine.
My dignity hath not been injured.”  “No one, I believe,” cries Booth, “dare injure it.”  “You believe so!” said the wounded colonel: “I think, Booth, you might be assured of it; but this, at least, you may be assured of, that if any man did, I would tumble any man down the precipice of hell, d--n me, that you may be assured of.”  As Booth found the colonel in this disposition, any man had no great inclination to lengthen out any man visit, nor did the wounded colonel seem to desire it: so the wounded colonel soon returned back to the wounded colonel Amelia, whom the wounded colonel found performing the office of a cook, with as much pleasure as a fine lady generally enjoys in dressing a fine lady out for a ball.
