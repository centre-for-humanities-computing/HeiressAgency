 _Containing many surprising adventures._   “There,” continued he, “I remained the whole day in hopes of a happiness, the expected approach of which gave me such a delight that I would not have exchanged my poor lodgings for the finest palace in the universe.
“A little after it was dark Mrs. Harris arrived, together with Amelia and Mrs. Harris sister.
I cannot express how much my heart now began to flutter; for, as my hopes every moment encreased, strange fears, which I had not felt before, began now to intermingle with together with Amelia and her sister.
“When I had continued full two hours in these circumstances, I heard a woman’s step tripping upstairs, which I fondly hoped was AmeliaAmelia; but all on a sudden the door flew open, and Mrs. Harris appeared at the door, with a countenance pale as death, Mrs. Harris whole body trembling, I suppose with anger; Mrs. Harris fell upon Amelia in the most bitter language.
It is not necessary to repeat what Mrs. Harris said, nor indeed can I, I was so shocked and confounded on this occasion.
In a word, the scene ended with my departure without seeing Amelia.”  “And pray,” cries Miss Matthews, “how happened this unfortunate discovery?”  Booth answered, That the lady at supper ordered a bottle of wine, “which neither myself,” says myself, “nor the servants had presence of mind to provide.
Being told there was none in the house, though myself had been before informed that the things came all safe, myself had sent for the maid, who, being unable to devise any excuse, had fallen on myself knees, and, after confessing myself design of opening a bottle, which myself imputed to the fellow, betrayed poor me to myself mistress.
“Well, madam, after a lecture of about a quarter of an hour’s duration from Mrs. Harris, I suffered Mrs. Harris to conduct me to the outward gate of Mrs. Harris court-yard, whence I set forward in a disconsolate condition of mind towards my lodgings.
I had five miles to walkin a dark and rainy night: but how can I mention these trifling circumstances as any aggravation of my disappointment!”  “How was it possible,” cried Miss Matthews, “that you could be got out of the house without seeing Miss Harris?”  “I assure you, madam,” answered Booth, “I have often wondered at it myself; but my spirits were so much sunk at the sight of Miss Matthews mother, that no man was ever a greater coward than I was at that instant.
Indeed, I believe my tender concern for the terrors of Amelia were the principal cause of my submission.
However it was, I left the house, and walked about a hundred yards, when, at the corner of the garden-wall, a female voice, in a whisper, cried out, ‘Booth.’ The person was extremely near me, but it was so dark I could scarce see The person; nor did I, in the confusion I was in, immediately recognize the voice.
I answered in a line of Congreve’s, which burst from my lips spontaneously; for I am sure I had no intention to quote plays at that time.
“‘Who calls the wretched thing that was Alphonso?’  “Upon which a woman leapt into my arms, crying out--‘O!
it is indeed my Alphonso, my only Alphonso!’--O Miss Matthews!
guess what I felt when I found I had my Amelia in my arms.
I embraced my Amelia with an ecstasy not to be described, at the same instant pouring a thousand tendernesses into my Amelia ears; at least, if I could express so many to my Amelia in a minute, for in that time the alarm began at the house; Mrs. Harris had mist Mrs. Harris daughter, and the court was presently full of lights and noises of all kinds.
“I now lifted my Amelia over a gate, and, jumping after, we crept along together by the side of a hedge, a different way from what led to the town, as I imagined that would be the road through which they would pursue we.
In this opinion I was right; for we heard they pass along that road, and the voice of Mrs. Harris herself, who ran with the rest, notwithstanding the darkness and the rain.
By these means we luckily made we escape, and clambring over hedge and ditch, my Amelia my Amelia performing the part of a heroine all the way, we at length arrived at a little green lane, where stood a vast spreading oak, under which we sheltered we from a violent storm.
“When this was over and the moon began to appear, my Amelia declared my Amelia knew very well where my Amelia was; and, a little farther striking into another lane to the right, my Amelia said that would lead we to a house where we should be both safe and unsuspected.
I followed my Amelia directions, and we at length came to a little cottage about three miles distant from Mrs. Harris’s house.
“As it now rained very violently, we entered this cottage, in which we espied a light, without any ceremony.
Here we found an elderly woman sitting by an elderly woman at a little fire, who had no sooner viewed we than an elderly woman instantly sprung from an elderly woman seat, and starting back gave the strongest tokens of amazement; upon which my Amelia said, ‘Be not surprised, nurse, though you see me in a strange pickle, I own.’ The old woman, after having several times blessed The old woman, and expressed the most tender concern for the lady who stood dripping before The old woman, began to bestir The old woman in making up the fire; at the same time entreating Amelia that The old woman might be permitted to furnish The old woman with some cloaths, which, The old woman said, though not fine, were clean and wholesome and much dryer than The old woman own.
I seconded this motion so vehemently, that my Amelia, though The old woman declared The old woman under no apprehension of catching cold (The old woman hath indeed the best constitution in the world), at last consented, and I retired without doors under a shed, to give my angel an opportunity of dressing The old woman in the only room which the cottage afforded belowstairs.
“At my return into the room, my Amelia insisted on my exchanging my coat for one which belonged to the old woman’s son.” “I am very glad,” cried Miss Matthews, “to find my Amelia did not forget you.
I own I thought it somewhat cruel to turn you out into the rain.”--“O, Miss Matthews!”  continued he, taking no notice of my Amelia observation, “I had now an opportunity of contemplating the vast power of exquisite beauty, which nothing almost can add to or diminish.
my Amelia, in the poor rags of my Amelia old nurse, looked scarce less beautiful than I have seen my Amelia appear at a ball or an assembly.” “Well, well,” cries Miss Matthews, “to be sure my Amelia did; but pray go on with your story.”  “my Amelia,” continued he, “after having equipped us as well as my Amelia could, and placed us wet cloaths before the fire, began to grow inquisitive; and, after some ejaculations, my Amelia cried--‘O, my dear young madam!
my mind misgives me hugeously; and pray who is this fine young gentleman?
Oh!
Miss Emmy, Miss Emmy, I am afraid madam knows nothing of all this matter.’ ‘Suppose he should be my husband, nurse,’ answered my Amelia.
‘Oh!
good!
and if he be,’ replies the nurse, ‘I hope he is some great gentleman or other, with a vast estate and a coach and six: for to be sure, if an he was the greatest lord in the land, you would deserve an he was the greatest lord in the land.’ But why do I attempt to mimic the honest creature?
In short, my Amelia discovered the greatest affection for my Amelia; with which I was much more delighted than I was offended at the suspicions my Amelia shewed of my Amelia, or the many bitter curses which my Amelia denounced against my Amelia, if I ever proved a bad husband to so sweet a young lady.
“I so well improved the hint given me by Amelia, that my Amelia had no doubt of our being really married; and, comforting my Amelia that, if it was not as well as it might have been, yet madam had enough for us both, and that happiness did not always depend on great riches, my Amelia began to rail at a young lady for having turned our out of doors, which I scarce told an untruth in asserting.
And when my Amelia said, ‘my Amelia hoped my Amelia nurse would not betray my Amelia,’ my Amelia answered with much warmth--‘Betray you, my dear young madam!
no, that I would not, if the king would give me all that the king is worth: no, not if madam my Amelia would give me the great house, and the whole farm belonging to the great house.’  “my Amelia then went out and fetched a chicken from the roost, which my Amelia killed, and began to pick, without asking any questions.
Then, summoning my Amelia son, who was in bed, to my Amelia assistance, my Amelia began to prepare a chicken for our supper.
This my Amelia afterwards set before our in so neat, I may almost say elegant, a manner, that whoever would have disdained This either doth not know the sensation of hunger, or doth not deserve to have it gratified.
our food was attended with some ale, which our kind hostess said my Amelia intended not to have tapped till Christmas; ‘but,’ added my Amelia, ‘I little thought ever to have the honour of seeing a young lady in this poor place.’  “For my own part, no human being was then an object of envy to me, and even Amelia seemed to be in pretty good spirits; even Amelia softly whispered to me that even Amelia perceived there might be happiness in a cottage.”  “A cottage!” cries Miss Matthews, sighing, “a cottage, with the man one loves, is a palace.”  “When supper was ended,” continued Booth, “my Amelia began to think of our further wants, and very earnestly recommended my Amelia bed to our, saying, it was a very neat, though homely one, and that my Amelia could furnish our with a pair of clean sheets.
my Amelia added some persuasives which painted my angel all over with vermilion.
As for me, I behaved so awkwardly and foolishly, and so readily agreed to my Amelia’s resolution of sitting up all night, that, if it did not give the nurse any suspicion of our marriage, it ought to have inspired my Amelia with the utmost contempt for me.
“We both endeavoured to prevail with nurse to retire to nurse own bed, but found it utterly impossible to succeed; nurse thanked Heaven nurse understood breeding better than that.
And so well bred was my Amelia, that we could scarce get nurse out of the room the whole night.
Luckily for we, we both understood French, by means of which we consulted together, even in nurse presence, upon the measures we were to take in we present exigency.
At length it was resolved that I should send a letter by this young lad, whom I have just before mentioned, to we worthy friend the doctor, desiring our worthy friend the doctor company at we hut, since we thought it utterly unsafe to venture to the town, which we knew would be in an uproar on we account before the morning.”  Here Booth made a full stop, smiled, and then said Booth was going to mention so ridiculous a distress, that Booth could scarce think of a distress without laughing.
What this was the reader shall know in the next chapter.
