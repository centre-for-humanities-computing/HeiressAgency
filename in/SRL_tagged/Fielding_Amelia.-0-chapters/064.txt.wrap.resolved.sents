 _The story of Mrs. Bennet continued._   I scarce know where I left off--Oh!
I was, I think, telling you that I esteemed my aunt as my rival; and it is not easy to conceive a greater degree of detestation than I had for my aunt; and what may, perhaps, appear strange, as my aunt daily grew more and more civil to me, my hatred encreased with my aunt civility; for I imputed it all to my aunt triumph over me, and to my aunt having secured, beyond all apprehension, the heart I longed for.
“How was I surprized when, one day, with as much good-humour as my aunt was mistress of (for my aunt countenance was not very pleasing), my aunt asked me how I liked Mrs. Bennet?
The question, you will believe, madam, threw me into great confusion, which my aunt plainly perceived, and, without waiting for my answer, told me my aunt was very well satisfied, for that it did not require my aunt discernment to read my thoughts in her countenance.
‘Well, child,’ my aunt said, ‘I have suspected this a great while, and I believe this will please you to know that I yesterday made the same discovery in your lover.’ This, I confess to you, was more than I could well bear, and I begged my aunt to say no more to me at that time on that subject.
‘Nay, child,’ answered my aunt, ‘I must tell you all, or I should not act a friendly part.
Mr. Bennet, I am convinced, hath a passion for Mr. Bennet; but it is a passion which, I think, you should not encourage.
For, to be plain with Mr. Bennet, I fear Mr. Bennet is in love with your person only.
Now this is a love, child, which cannot produce that rational happiness which a woman of sense ought to expect.’ In short, my aunt ran on with a great deal of stuff about rational happiness, and women of sense, and concluded with assuring me that, after the strictest scrutiny, my aunt could not find that Mr. Bennet had an adequate opinion of my understanding; upon which my aunt vouchsafed to make me many compliments, but mixed with several sarcasms concerning my learning.
“I hope, madam, however,” said my aunt to Amelia, “you have not so bad an opinion of my capacity as to imagine me dull enough to be offended with Mr. Bennet’s sentiments, for which I presently knew so well to account.
I was, indeed, charmed with Mr. Bennet ingenuity, who had discovered, perhaps, the only way of reconciling my aunt to those inclinations which I now assured Mr. Bennet Mr. Bennet had for Mr. Bennet.
“I was not long left to support my hopes by my sagacity.
Mr. Bennet soon found an opportunity of declaring Mr. Bennet passion.
Mr. Bennet did this in so forcible though gentle a manner, with such a profusion of fervency and tenderness at once, that Mr. Bennet love, like a torrent, bore everything before it; and I am almost ashamed to own to you how very soon Mr. Bennet prevailed upon Mr. Bennet to--to--in short, to be an honest woman, and to confess to Mr. Bennet the plain truth.
“When we were upon a good footing together Mr. Bennet gave me a long relation of what had past at several interviews with my aunt, at which I had not been present.
Mr. Bennet said Mr. Bennet had discovered that, as she valued she chiefly on she understanding, so she was extremely jealous of mine, and hated me on account of Learning.
That, as Mr. Bennet had loved me passionately from Mr. Bennet first seeing me, and had thought of nothing from that time but of throwing Mr. Bennet at my feet, Mr. Bennet saw no way so open to propitiate my aunt as that which Mr. Bennet had taken by commending my beauty, a perfection to which she had long resigned all claim, at the expense of my understanding, in which Mr. Bennet lamented my deficiency to a degree almost of ridicule.
This Mr. Bennet imputed chiefly to Learning; on this occasion Mr. Bennet advanced a sentiment which so pleased my aunt that my aunt thought proper to make it my aunt own; for I heard it afterwards more than once from my aunt own mouth.
Learning, Mr. Bennet said, had the same effect on the mind that strong liquors have on the constitution; both tending to eradicate all our natural fire and energy.
Mr. Bennet flattery had made such a dupe of my aunt that my aunt assented, without the least suspicion of Mr. Bennet sincerity, to all Mr. Bennet said; so sure is vanity to weaken every fortress of the understanding, and to betray us to every attack of the enemy.
“You will believe, madam, that I readily forgave him all him had said, not only from that motive which I have mentioned, but as I was assured him had spoke the reverse of him real sentiments.
I was not, however, quite so well pleased with my aunt, who began to treat me as if I was really an idiot.
Her contempt, I own, a little piqued me; and I could not help often expressing my resentment, when us were alone together, to Mr. Bennet, who never failed to gratify me by making Her conceit the subject of his wit; a talent which his possessed in the most extraordinary degree.
“This proved of very fatal consequence; for one day, while us were enjoying my aunt in a very thick arbour in the garden, my aunt stole upon us unobserved, and overheard us whole conversation.
I wish, my dear, you understood Latin, that I might repeat you a sentence in which the rage of a tigress that hath lost my aunt young is described.
No English poet, as I remember, hath come up to it; nor am I myself equal to the undertaking.
my aunt burst in upon us, open-mouthed, and after discharging every abusive word almost, in the only language my aunt understood, on poor Mr. Bennet, turned us both out of doors, declaring my aunt would send my rags after my aunt, but would never more permit me to set my foot within my aunt threshold.
“Consider, dear madam, to what a wretched condition us were now reduced.
I had not yet received the small legacy left me by my father; nor was Mr. Bennet master of five pounds in the whole world.
“In this situation, the man I doated on to distraction had but little difficulty to persuade me to a proposal which, indeed, I thought generous in the man I doated on to distraction to make, as it seemed to proceed from that tenderness for my reputation to which the man I doated on to distraction ascribed it; indeed, it could proceed from no motive with which I should have been displeased.
In a word, within two days we were man and wife.
“poor Mr. Bennet now declared poor Mr. Bennet the happiest of men; and, for my part, I sincerely declared I envied no woman upon earth.
How little, alas!
did I then know or suspect the price I was to pay for all my joys!
A match of real love is, indeed, truly paradise; and such perfect happiness seems to be the forbidden fruit to mortals, which we are to lament having tasted during the rest of we lives.
“The first uneasiness which attacked we after we marriage was on my aunt’s account.
’s account was very disagreeable to live under the nose of so near a relation, who did not acknowledge we, but on the contrary, was ever doing us all the ill turns in my aunt power, and making a party against we in the parish, which is always easy enough to do amongst the vulgar against persons who are their superiors in rank, and, at the same time, their inferiors in fortune.
This made Mr. Bennet think of procuring an exchange, in which intention Mr. Bennet was soon after confirmed by the arrival of the rector.
It was the rector’s custom to spend three months every year at Mr. Bennet living, for which purpose Mr. Bennet reserved an apartment in Mr. Bennet parsonage-house, which was full large enough for two such little families as then occupied it.
we at first promised we some little convenience from Mr. Bennet boarding with we; and Mr. Bennet began to lay aside Mr. Bennet thoughts of leaving Mr. Bennet curacy, at least for some time.
But these golden ideas presently vanished; for, though we both used we both utmost endeavours to please Mr. Bennet, we soon found the impossibility of succeeding.
Mr. Bennet was, indeed, to give you Mr. Bennet character in a word, the most peevish of mortals.
This temper, notwithstanding that Mr. Bennet was both a good and a pious man, made Mr. Bennet company so insufferable that nothing could compensate his company.
If Mr. Bennet breakfast was not ready to a moment--if a dish of meat was too much or too little done--in short, if anything failed of exactly hitting Mr. Bennet taste, Mr. Bennet was sure to be out of humour all that day, so that, indeed, Mr. Bennet was scarce ever in a good temper a whole day together; for fortune seems to take a delight in thwarting this kind of disposition, to which human life, with its many crosses and accidents, is, in truth, by no means fitted.
“poor Mr. Bennet was now, by my desire as well as poor Mr. Bennet own, determined to quit the parish; but when poor Mr. Bennet attempted to get an exchange, poor Mr. Bennet found it a matter of more difficulty than poor Mr. Bennet had apprehended; for the rector’s temper was so well known among the neighbouring clergy, that none of the neighbouring clergy could be brought to think of spending three months in a year with poor Mr. Bennet.
“After many fruitless enquiries, poor Mr. Bennet thought best to remove to London, the great mart of all affairs, ecclesiastical and civil.
This project greatly pleased poor Mr. Bennet, and poor Mr. Bennet resolved, without more delay, to take poor Mr. Bennet leave of the rector, which poor Mr. Bennet did in the most friendly manner possible, and preached poor Mr. Bennet farewell sermon; nor was there a dry eye in the church, except among the few, whom my aunt, who remained still inexorable, had prevailed upon to hate us without any cause.
“To London us came, and took up us lodging the first night at the inn where the stage-coach set us down: the next morning my husband went out early on my husband business, and returned with the good news of having heard of a curacy, and of having equipped my husband with a lodging in the neighbourhood of a worthy peer, ‘who,’ said my husband, ‘was my fellow-collegiate; and, what is more, I have a direction to a person who will advance your legacy at a very reasonable rate.’  “This last particular was extremely agreeable to me, for us last guinea was now broached; and the rector had lent my husband ten pounds to pay my husband debts in the country, for, with all my husband peevishness, my husband was a good and a generous man, and had, indeed, so many valuable qualities, that I lamented my husband temper, after I knew my husband thoroughly, as much on my husband account as on my own.
“us now quitted the inn and went to us lodgings, where my husband having placed me in safety, as my husband said, my husband went about the business of the legacy with good assurance of success.
“my husband returned elated with my husband success, the person to whom my husband applied having undertaken to advance the legacy, which my husband fulfilled as soon as the proper enquiries could be made, and proper instruments prepared for that purpose.
“This, however, took up so much time, that, as our fund was so very low, our were reduced to some distress, and obliged to live extremely penurious; nor would all do without my taking a most disagreeable way of procuring money by pawning one of my gowns.
“poor Mr. Bennet was now settled in a curacy in town, greatly to poor Mr. Bennet satisfaction, and our affairs seemed to have a prosperous aspect, when poor Mr. Bennet came home to poor Mr. Bennet one morning in much apparent disorder, looking as pale as death, and begged me by some means or other to get poor Mr. Bennet a dram, for that poor Mr. Bennet was taken with a sudden faintness and lowness of spirits.
“Frighted as I was, I immediately ran downstairs, and procured some rum of the mistress of the house; the first time, indeed, I ever knew poor Mr. Bennet drink any.
When poor Mr. Bennet came to poor Mr. Bennet poor Mr. Bennet begged me not to be alarmed, for it was no distemper, but something that had vexed poor Mr. Bennet, which had caused poor Mr. Bennet disorder, which poor Mr. Bennet had now perfectly recovered.
“poor Mr. Bennet then told me the whole affair.
poor Mr. Bennet had hitherto deferred paying a visit to the lord whom I mentioned to have been formerly poor Mr. Bennet fellow-collegiate, and was now poor Mr. Bennet neighbour, till poor Mr. Bennet could put poor Mr. Bennet in decent rigging.
poor Mr. Bennet had now purchased a new cassock, hat, and wig, and went to pay poor Mr. Bennet respects to poor Mr. Bennet old acquaintance, who had received from poor Mr. Bennet many civilities and assistances in poor Mr. Bennet learning at the university, and had promised to return a new cassock, hat, and wig fourfold hereafter.
“It was not without some difficulty that poor Mr. Bennet got into the antechamber.
Here poor Mr. Bennet waited, or as the phrase is, cooled poor Mr. Bennet heels, for above an hour before poor Mr. Bennet saw poor Mr. Bennet lordship; nor had poor Mr. Bennet seen poor Mr. Bennet then but by an accident; for my lord was going out when poor Mr. Bennet casually intercepted poor Mr. Bennet in poor Mr. Bennet passage to poor Mr. Bennet chariot.
poor Mr. Bennet approached to salute poor Mr. Bennet with some familiarity, though with respect, depending on poor Mr. Bennet former intimacy, when my lord, stepping short, very gravely told poor Mr. Bennet poor Mr. Bennet had not the pleasure of knowing poor Mr. Bennet.
How!
my lord, said my lord, can you have so soon forgot your old acquaintance Tom Bennet?
O, poor Mr. Bennet!
cries his lordship, with much reserve, is it you?
you will pardon my memory.
I am glad to see you, Mr. Bennet, but you must excuse me at present, for I am in very great haste.
poor Mr. Bennet then broke from poor Mr. Bennet, and without more ceremony, or any further invitation, went directly into his chariot.
“This cold reception from a person for whom my husband had a real friendship, and from whom my husband had great reason to expect a very warm return of affection, so affected the poor man, that it caused all those symptoms which I have mentioned before.
“Though this incident produced no material consequence, I could not pass this incident over in silence, as, of all the misfortunes which ever befel him, this incident affected my husband the most.
I need not, however, to a woman of your delicacy, make any comments on a behaviour which, though I believe it is very common, is, nevertheless, cruel and base beyond description, and is diametrically opposite to true honour as well as to goodness.
“To relieve the uneasiness which my husband felt on account of my husband false friend, I prevailed with my husband to go every night, almost for a fortnight together, to the play; a diversion of which my husband was greatly fond, and from which my husband did not think my husband being a clergyman excluded my husband; indeed, it is very well if those austere persons who would be inclined to censure my husband on this head have those austere persons who would be inclined to censure him on this head no greater sins to answer for.
“From this time, during three months, we past we time very agreeably, a little too agreeably perhaps for we circumstances; for, however innocent diversions may be in other respects, those austere persons who would be inclined to censure him on this head must be owned to be expensive.
When you consider then, madam, that we income from the curacy was less than forty pounds a year, and that, after payment of the debt to the rector, and another to my aunt, with the costs in law which my aunt had occasioned by suing for it, my legacy was reduced to less than seventy pounds, you will not wonder that, in diversions, cloaths, and the common expenses of life, we had almost consumed we whole stock.
“The inconsiderate manner in which we had lived for some time will, I doubt not, appear to you to want some excuse; but I have none to make for it.
Two things, however, now happened, which occasioned much serious reflexion to poor Mr. Bennet; the one was, that I grew near my time; the other, that poor Mr. Bennet now received a letter from Oxford, demanding the debt of forty pounds which I mentioned to you before.
The former of these poor Mr. Bennet made a pretence of obtaining a delay for the payment of the latter, promising, in two months, to pay off half the debt, by which means poor Mr. Bennet obtained a forbearance during that time.
“I was now delivered of a son, a matter which should in reality have encreased our concern, but, on the contrary, it gave our great pleasure; greater indeed could not have been conceived at the birth of an heir to the most plentiful estate: so entirely thoughtless were our, and so little forecast had our of those many evils and distresses to which our had rendered a human creature, and one so dear to our, liable.
The day of a christening is, in all families, I believe, a day of jubilee and rejoicing; and yet, if our consider the interest of that little wretch who is the occasion, how very little reason would the most sanguine persons have for the most sanguine persons joy!
“But, though our eyes were too weak to look forward, for the sake of our child, our could not be blinded to those dangers that immediately threatened our.
poor Mr. Bennet, at the expiration of the two months, received a second letter from Oxford, in a very peremptory stile, and threatening a suit without any farther delay.
This alarmed our in the strongest manner; and my husband, to secure poor Mr. Bennet liberty, was advised for a while to shelter poor Mr. Bennet in the verge of the court.
“And, now, madam, I am entering on that scene which directly leads to all my misery.”--Here she stopped, and wiped she eyes; and then, begging Amelia to excuse she for a few minutes, ran hastily out of the room, leaving Amelia by she, while she refreshed she spirits with a cordial to enable she to relate what follows in the next chapter.
