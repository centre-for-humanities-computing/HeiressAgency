 _In which Mr. Booth sets forward on Mr. Booth journey._   “Well, madam, we have now taken we leave of Amelia. I rode a full mile before I once suffered myself to look back; but now being come to the top of a little hill, the last spot I knew which could give me a prospect of Mrs. Harris’s house, my resolution failed: I stopped and cast my eyes backward. Shall I tell you what I felt at that instant? I do assure you I am not able. So many tender ideas crowded at once into my mind, that, if I may use the expression, many tender ideas almost dissolved my heart. And now, madam, the most unfortunate accident came first into my head. This was, that I had in the hurry and confusion left the dear casket behind myself. The thought of going back at first suggested The thought of going back at first; but the consequences of that were too apparent. I therefore resolved to send my man, and in the meantime to ride on softly on my road. my man immediately executed my orders, and after some time, feeding my eyes with that delicious and yet heartfelt prospect, I at last turned my horse to descend the hill, and proceeded about a hundred yards, when, considering with myself that I should lose no time by a second indulgence, I again turned back, and once more feasted my sight with the same painful pleasure till my man returned, bringing me the dear casket, and an account that Amelia still continued in the sweet sleep I left Amelia. I now suddenly turned my horse for the last time, and with the utmost resolution pursued my journey.  “I perceived my man at my man return--But before I mention anything of my man it may be proper, madam, to acquaint you who my man was. my man was the foster-brother of my Amelia. This young fellow had taken it into This young fellow head to go into the army; and This young fellow was desirous to serve under my command. The doctor consented to discharge This young fellow; This young fellow mother at last yielded to This young fellow importunities, and I was very easily prevailed on to list one of the handsomest young fellows in England.  “You will easily believe I had some little partiality to one whose milk Amelia had sucked; but, as whose milk Amelia had never seen the regiment, I had no opportunity to shew whose milk Amelia any great mark of favour. Indeed whose milk Amelia waited on me as my servant; and I treated my servant with all the tenderness which can be used to one in that station.  “When I was about to change into the horse-guards This young fellow began to droop, fearing that whose milk Amelia should no longer be in the same corps with me, though certainly that would not have been the case. However, whose milk Amelia had never mentioned one word of whose milk Amelia dissatisfaction. whose milk Amelia is indeed a fellow of a noble spirit; but when whose milk Amelia heard that I was to remain where I was, and that we were to go to Gibraltar together, whose milk Amelia fell into transports of joy little short of madness. In short, a fellow of a noble spirit had imbibed a very strong affection for me; though this was what I knew nothing of till long after.  “When whose milk Amelia returned to me then, as I was saying, with the casket, I observed whose milk Amelia eyes all over blubbered with tears. I rebuked whose milk Amelia a little too rashly on this occasion. ‘Heyday!’ says I, ‘what is the meaning of this? I hope I have not a milk-sop with me. If I thought you would shew such a face to the enemy I would leave you behind.’--‘Your honour need not fear that,’ answered he; ‘I shall find nobody there that I shall love well enough to make me cry.’ I was highly pleased with this answer, in which I thought I could discover both sense and spirit. I then asked whose milk Amelia what had occasioned those tears since whose milk Amelia had left me (for whose milk Amelia had no sign of any at that time), and whether whose milk Amelia had seen whose milk Amelia mother at Mrs. Harris’s? whose milk Amelia answered in the negative, and begged that I would ask whose milk Amelia no more questions; adding that whose milk Amelia was not very apt to cry, and whose milk Amelia hoped whose milk Amelia should never give me such another opportunity of blaming whose milk Amelia. I mention this only as an instance of whose milk Amelia affection towards me; for I never could account for those tears any otherwise than by placing those tears to the account of that distress in which whose milk Amelia left me at that time. We travelled full forty miles that day without baiting, when, arriving at the inn where I intended to rest that night, I retired immediately to my chamber, with my dear Amelia’s casket, the opening of which was the nicest repast, and to which every other hunger gave way.  “It is impossible to mention to you all the little matters with which Amelia had furnished my dear Amelia’s casket. my dear Amelia’s casket contained medicines of all kinds, which Amelia mother, who was the Lady Bountiful of that country, had supplied Amelia with. The most valuable of all to me was a lock of Amelia dear hair, which I have from that time to this worn in my bosom. What would I have then given for a little picture of my dear angel, which Amelia had lost from Amelia about a month before! and which we had the highest reason in the world to imagine Amelia sister had taken away; for the suspicion lay only between her sister and Amelia’s maid, who was of all creatures the honestest, and whom Amelia mistress had often trusted with things of much greater value; for the picture, which was set in gold, and had two or three little diamonds round it, was worth about twelve guineas only; whereas Amelia left jewels in Amelia care of much greater value.”  “Sure,” cries Miss Matthews, “Amelia could not be such a paultry pilferer.”  “Not on account of the gold or the jewels,” cries Booth. “We imputed it to mere spite, with which, I assure you, Amelia abounds; and Amelia knew that, next to Amelia herself, there was nothing which I valued so much as this little picture; for such a resemblance did it bear of the original, that Hogarth himself did never, I believe, draw a stronger likeness. Spite, therefore, was the only motive to this cruel depredation; and indeed Amelia behaviour on the occasion sufficiently convinced us both of the justice of us suspicion, though us neither of us durst accuse Amelia; and Amelia herself had the assurance to insist very strongly (though Amelia could not prevail) with Amelia to turn away Amelia innocent maid, saying, Amelia would not live in the house with a thief.”  Miss Matthews now discharged some curses on Miss Betty, not much worth repeating, and then Mr. Booth proceeded in Mr. Booth relation.
