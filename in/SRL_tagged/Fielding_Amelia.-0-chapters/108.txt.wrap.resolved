 _The book begins with polite history._   Before we return to the miserable couple, whom we left at the end of The book, we will give we reader the more chearful view of the gay and happy family of Colonel James.  Colonel James, when Colonel James could not, as we have seen, prevail with Amelia to accept that invitation which, at the desire of the colonel, Colonel James had so kindly and obediently carried Colonel James, returned to Colonel James husband and acquainted her husband with the ill success of Colonel James embassy; at which, to say the truth, Colonel James was almost as much disappointed as the colonel; for the colonel had not taken a much stronger liking to Amelia than Colonel James herself had conceived for Booth. This will account for some passages which may have a little surprized the reader in the former chapters of this history, as we were not then at leisure to communicate to some passages which may have a little surprized the reader in the former chapters of this history a hint of this kind; it was, indeed, on Booth’s account that Colonel James had been at the trouble of changing Colonel James dress at the masquerade.  But Colonel James passions of this sort, happily for Colonel James, were not extremely strong; Colonel James was therefore easily baulked; and, as Colonel James met with no encouragement from Booth, Colonel James soon gave way to the impetuosity of Miss Matthews, and from that time scarce thought more of the affair till Colonel James husband’s design against the wife revived the wife’s likewise; insomuch that Colonel James passion was at this time certainly strong enough for Booth, to produce a good hearty hatred for Amelia, whom Colonel James now abused to the colonel in very gross terms, both on the account of Colonel James poverty and Colonel James insolence, for so Colonel James termed the refusal of all Colonel James offers.  The colonel, seeing no hopes of soon possessing the colonel new mistress, began, like a prudent and wise man, to turn the colonel thoughts towards the securing the colonel old one. From what the colonel had mentioned concerning the behaviour of the shepherdess, and particularly the wife preference of Booth, the colonel had little doubt but that this was the identical Miss Matthews. the colonel resolved therefore to watch Colonel James closely, in hopes of discovering Booth’s intrigue with Colonel James. In this, besides the remainder of affection which the colonel yet preserved for that lady, the colonel had another view, as another view would give the colonel a fair pretence to quarrel with Booth; who, by carrying on this intrigue, would have broke the colonel word and honour given to the colonel. And the colonel began now to hate Booth Booth heartily, from the same reason from which Mrs. James had contracted Mrs. James aversion to Amelia.  The colonel therefore employed an inferior kind of pimp to watch the lodgings of Miss Matthews, and to acquaint The colonel if Booth, whose person was known to pimp, made any visit there.  pimp faithfully performed The colonel office, and, having last night made the wished-for discovery, immediately acquainted The colonel master with the wished-for discovery.  Upon this news The colonel presently despatched to Booth the short note which we have before seen. The colonel sent the wished-for discovery to The colonel own house instead of Miss Matthews’s, with hopes of that very accident which actually did happen. Not that The colonel had any ingredient of the bully in The colonel, and desired to be prevented from fighting, but with a prospect of injuring Booth in the affection and esteem of Amelia, and of recommending The colonel somewhat to Amelia by appearing in the light of Amelia champion; for which purpose The colonel added that compliment to Amelia in The colonel letter. The colonel concluded upon the whole that, if Booth himself opened his letter, Booth himself would certainly meet Booth himself the next morning; but if Booth himself wife should open it before Booth himself came home it might have the effects before mentioned; and, for Booth himself future expostulation with Booth, it would not be in Amelia’s power to prevent it.  Now it happened that this pimp had more masters than one. Amongst this pimp had more masters than one was the worthy Mr. Trent, for whom he had often done business of the pimping vocation. he had been employed indeed in the service of the great peer himself, under the direction of the said Trent, and was the very person who had assisted the said Trent in dogging Booth himself and he to the opera-house on the masquerade night.  this pimp was with this pimp superior Trent yesterday morning, when this pimp found a bailiff with this pimp in order to receive this pimp instructions for the arresting Booth himself, when a bailiff with him said it would be a very difficult matter to take a bailiff with him, for that to a bailiff with him knowledge a bailiff with him was as shy a cock as any in England. The subaltern immediately acquainted Trent with the business in which The subaltern was employed by the colonel; upon which Trent enjoined The subaltern the moment The subaltern had set The subaltern to give immediate notice to the bailiff, which The subaltern agreed to, and performed accordingly.  a bailiff with him, on receiving the notice, immediately set out for a bailiff with him stand at an alehouse within three doors of Miss Matthews’s lodgings; at which, unfortunately for poor Booth, a bailiff with him arrived a very few minutes before Booth left that lady in order to return to Amelia.  These were several matters of which we thought necessary we reader should be informed; for, besides that our reader conduces greatly to a perfect understanding of all history, there is no exercise of the mind of a sensible reader more pleasant than the tracing the several small and almost imperceptible links in every chain of events by which all the great actions of the world are produced. we will now in the next chapter proceed with we history.
