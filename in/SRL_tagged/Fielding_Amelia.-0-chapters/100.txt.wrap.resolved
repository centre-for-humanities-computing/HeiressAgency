 _Matters political._   Before we return to Booth we will relate a scene in which Dr Harrison was concerned.  This good man, whilst in the country, happened to be in the neighbourhood of a nobleman of his acquaintance, and whom his knew to have very considerable interest with the ministers at that time.  The doctor, who was very well known to this nobleman, took this opportunity of paying his a visit in order to recommend poor Booth to his favour. Nor did his much doubt of his success, the favour his was to ask being a very small one, and to which his thought the service of Booth gave his so just a title.  The doctor’s name soon gained his an admission to the presence of this great man, who, indeed, received his with much courtesy and politeness; not so much, perhaps, from any particular regard to the sacred function, nor from any respect to the doctor’s personal merit, as from some considerations which the reader will perhaps guess anon. After many ceremonials, and some previous discourse on different subjects, The doctor opened the business, and told the great man that The doctor was come to The doctor to solicit a favour for a young gentleman who had been an officer in the army and was now on half-pay. “All the favour I ask, my lord,” said my lord, “is, that a young gentleman who had been an officer in the army and was now on half-pay may be again admitted _ad_ _eundem_. I am convinced your lordship will do me the justice to think I would not ask for a worthless person; but, indeed, the young man I mean hath very extraordinary merit. the young man was at the siege of Gibraltar, in which the young man behaved with distinguished bravery, and was dangerously wounded at two several times in the service of the young man country. I will add that the young man is at present in great necessity, and hath a wife and several children, for whom the young man hath no other means of providing; and, if it will recommend the young man farther to your lordship’s favour, the young man wife, I believe, is one of the best and worthiest of all her sex.”  “As to that, my dear doctor,” cries the nobleman, “I shall make no doubt. Indeed any service I shall do the gentleman will be upon your account. As to necessity, it is the plea of so many that it is impossible to serve them all. And with regard to the personal merit of these inferior officers, I believe I need not tell you that it is very little regarded. But if you recommend him, let the person be what the person will, I am convinced the person will be done; for I know the person is in your power at present to ask for a greater matter than this.”  “I depend entirely upon your lordship,” answered the doctor.  “Indeed, my worthy friend,” replied the lord, “I will not take a merit to myself which will so little belong to myself. You are to depend on my worthy friend. It falls out very luckily too at this time, when you have It in your power so greatly to oblige us.”  “What, the lord, is in my power?” cries the doctor.  “You certainly know,” answered the doctor , “how hard Colonel Trompington is run at your town in the election of a mayor; they tell me it will be a very near thing unless you join they. But they know it is in your power to do the business, and turn the scale. I heard your name mentioned the other day on that account, and I know you may have anything in reason if you will give they your interest.”  “Sure, the lord,” cries the doctor, “you are not in earnest in asking my interest for Colonel Trompington?”  “Indeed I am,” answered the peer; “why should you doubt the peer?”  “For many reasons,” answered the doctor. “First, I am an old friend and acquaintance of Mr. Fairfield, as your lordship, I believe, very well knows. The little interest, therefore, that I have, you may be assured, will go in his favour. Indeed, I do not concern myself deeply in these affairs, for I do not think it becomes my cloth so to do. But, as far as I think it decent to interest myself, it will certainly be on the side of Mr. Fairfield. Indeed, I should do so if I was acquainted with both the gentlemen only by reputation; the one being a neighbouring gentleman of a very large estate, a very sober and sensible man, of known probity and attachment to the true interest of I was acquainted with both the gentlemen only by reputation country; the other is a mere stranger, a boy, a soldier of fortune, and, as far as I can discern from the little conversation I have had with I was acquainted with both the gentlemen only by reputation, of a very shallow capacity, and no education.”  “No education, my dear friend!” cries the nobleman. “Why, the nobleman hath been educated in half the courts of Europe.”  “Perhaps so, my lord,” answered the doctor; “but I shall always be so great a pedant as to call a man of no learning a man of no education. And, from my own knowledge, I can aver that I am persuaded there is scarce a foot-soldier in the army who is more illiterate than the colonel.”  “Why, as to Latin and Greek, you know,” replied my lord, “they are not much required in the army.”  “It may be so,” said the doctor. “Then let such persons keep to such persons own profession. It is a very low civil capacity indeed for which an illiterate man can be qualified. And, to speak a plain truth, if your lordship is a friend to the colonel, you would do well to advise your lordship is a friend to the colonel to decline an attempt in which I am certain your lordship is a friend to the colonel hath no probability of success.”  “Well, sir,” said my lord, “if you are resolved against us, I must deal as freely with my lord, and tell you plainly I cannot serve you in your affair. Nay, it will be the best thing I can do to hold my tongue; for, if I should mention my tongue name with your recommendation after what you have said, my tongue would perhaps never get provided for as long as my tongue lives.”  “Is my tongue own merit, then, my lord, no recommendation?” cries the doctor.  “My dear, dear sir,” cries the other, “what is the merit of a subaltern officer?”  “Surely, my lord,” cries the doctor, “it is the merit which should recommend my lord to the post of a subaltern officer. And it is a merit which will hereafter qualify my lord to serve my lord country in a higher capacity. And I do assure of this young man, that this young man hath not only a good heart but a good head too. And I have been told by those who are judges that he is, for he age, an excellent officer.”  “Very probably!” cries my lord. “And there are abundance with the same merit and the same qualifications who want a morsel of bread for the same merit and the same qualifications who want a morsel of bread for themselves and their families and the same merit and the same qualifications who want a morsel of bread for themselves and their families families.”  “It is an infamous scandal on the nation,” cries the doctor; “and I am heartily sorry it can be said even with a colour of truth.”  “How can it be otherwise?” says the peer. “Do you think it is possible to provide for all men of merit?”  “Yes, surely do I,” said the doctor; “and very easily too.”  “How, pray?” cries my lord. “Upon my word, I shall be glad to know.”  “Only by not providing for those who have none. The men of merit in any capacity are not, I am afraid, so extremely numerous that we need starve any of The men of merit in any capacity, unless we wickedly suffer a set of worthless fellows to eat The men of merit in any capacity bread.”  “This is all mere Utopia,” cries his lordship; “the chimerical system of Plato’s commonwealth, with which we amused we at the university; politics which are inconsistent with the state of human affairs.”  “Sure, my lord,” cries the doctor, “we have read of states where such doctrines have been put in practice. What is his lordship’s opinion of Rome in the earlier ages of the commonwealth, of Sparta, and even of Athens itself in some periods of Athens itself history?”  “Indeed, doctor,” cries my lord, “all these notions are obsolete and long since exploded. To apply maxims of government drawn from the Greek and Roman histories to this nation is absurd and impossible. But, if you will have Roman examples, fetch you will have Roman examples from those times of the republic that were most like our own. Do you not know, doctor, that this is as corrupt a nation as ever existed under the sun? And would you think of governing such a people by the strict principles of honesty and morality?”  “If it be so corrupt,” said the doctor, “I think it is high time to amend it: or else it is easy to foresee that Roman and British liberty will have the same fate; for corruption in the body politic as naturally tends to dissolution as in the natural body.”  “I thank you for your simile,” cries my lord; “for, in the natural body, I believe, you will allow there is the season of youth, the season of manhood, and the season of old age; and that, when the last of these arrives, it will be an impossible attempt by all the means of art to restore the natural body again to the natural body youth, or to the vigour of the natural body middle age. The same periods happen to every great kingdom. In the natural body youth the natural body rises by arts and arms to power and prosperity. This it enjoys and flourishes with a while; and then it may be said to be in the vigour of it age, enriched at home with all the emoluments and blessings of peace, and formidable abroad with all the terrors of war. At length this very prosperity introduces corruption, and then comes on it old age. Virtue and learning, art and industry, decay by degrees. The people sink into sloth and luxury and prostitution. It is enervated at home--becomes contemptible abroad; and such indeed is It misery and wretchedness, that It resembles a man in the last decrepit stage of life, who looks with unconcern at a man approaching dissolution.”  “This is a melancholy picture indeed,” cries the doctor; “and, if the latter part of it can be applied to our case, I see nothing but religion, which would have prevented this decrepit state of the constitution, should prevent a man of spirit from hanging a man of spirit out of the way of so wretched a contemplation.”  “Why so?” said the peer; “why hang myself, doctor? Would it not be wiser, think you, to make the best of your time, and the most you can, in such a nation?”  “And is religion, then, to be really laid out of the question?” cries doctor.  “If I am to speak my own opinion, sir,” answered the peer, “you know I shall answer in the negative. But you are too well acquainted with the world to be told that the conduct of politicians is not formed upon the principles of religion.”  “I am very sorry for it,” cries doctor; “but I will talk to them then of honour and honesty; this is a language which I hope them will at least pretend to understand. Now to deny a man the preferment which he merits, and to give this to another man who doth not merit this, is a manifest act of injustice, and is consequently inconsistent with both honour and honesty. Nor is it only an act of injustice to the man himself, but to the public, for whose good principally all public offices are, or ought to be, instituted. Now this good can never be completed nor obtained but by employing all persons according to all persons capacities. Wherever true merit is liable to be superseded by favour and partiality, and men are intrusted with offices without any regard to capacity or integrity, the affairs of this decrepit state of the constitution will always be in a deplorable situation. Such, as Livy tells us, was this decrepit state of the constitution a little before this decrepit state of the constitution final destruction, and the consequence your lordship well knows. But, my lord, there is another mischief which attends this kind of injustice, and that is, it hath a manifest tendency to destroy all virtue and all ability among the people, by taking away all that encouragement and incentive which should promote emulation and raise men to aim at excelling in any art, science, or profession. Nor can anything, my lord, contribute more to render a nation contemptible among its neighbours; for what opinion can other countries have of the councils, or what terror can other countries conceive of the arms, of such a people? and it was chiefly owing to the avoiding this error that Oliver Cromwell carried the reputation of England higher than it ever was at any other time. I will add only one argument more, and that is founded on the most narrow and selfish system of politics; and this is, that such a conduct is sure to create universal discontent and grumbling at home; for nothing can bring men to rest satisfied, when men see others preferred to men, but an opinion that others deserved that elevation; for, as one of the greatest men this country ever produced observes,       One worthless man that gains what he pretends      Disgusts a thousand unpretending friends.  With what heart-burnings then must any nation see themselves obliged to contribute to the support of a set of men of whose incapacity to serve themselves themselves are well apprized, and who do themselves country a double diskindness, by being themselves employed in posts to which themselves are unequal, and by keeping others out of those employments for which themselves are qualified!”  “And do you really think, doctor,” cries the nobleman, “that any minister could support any minister in this country upon such principles as you recommend? Do you think any minister would be able to baffle an opposition unless any minister should oblige any minister friends by conferring places often contrary to any minister own inclinations and any minister own opinion?”  “Yes, really do I,” cries doctor. “Indeed, if a minister is resolved to make good a minister confession in the liturgy, _by leaving undone all those things which a minister ought to have done, and by doing all those things which a minister ought not to have done,_ such a minister, I grant, will be obliged to baffle opposition, as you are pleased to term it, by these arts; for, as Shakespeare somewhere says,      Things ill begun strengthen Things ill begun strengthen themselves by ill.   by ill.  But if, on the contrary, a minister will please to consider the true interest of a minister , and that only in great and national points; if a minister will engage a minister in neither alliances nor quarrels but where it is really interested; if a minister will raise no money but what is wanted, nor employ any civil or military officers but what are useful, and place in these employments men of the highest integrity, and of the greatest abilities; if a minister will employ some few of a minister hours to advance our trade, and some few more to regulate our domestic government; if a minister would do this, my lord, I will answer for it, a minister shall either have no opposition to baffle, or a minister shall baffle it by a fair appeal to a minister conduct. Such a minister may, in the language of the law, put Such a minister on Such a minister when Such a minister pleases, and Such a minister shall come off with honour and applause.”  “And do you really believe, doctor,” cries the peer, “there ever was such a minister, or ever will be?”  “Why not, my lord?” answered doctor. “It requires no very extraordinary parts, nor any extraordinary degree of virtue. Such a minister need practise no great instances of self-denial. Such a minister shall have power, and honour, and riches, and, perhaps, all in a much greater degree than Such a minister can ever acquire by pursuing a contrary system. Such a minister shall have more of each and much more of safety.”  “Pray, doctor,” said my lord, “let me ask you one simple question. Do you really believe any man upon earth was ever a rogue out of choice?”  “Really, my lord,” says doctor, “I am ashamed to answer in the affirmative; and yet I am afraid experience would almost justify me if I should. Perhaps the opinion of the world may sometimes mislead men to think those measures necessary which in reality are not so. Or the truth may be, that a man of good inclinations finds a man of good inclinations office filled with such corruption by the iniquity of a man of good inclinations predecessors, that a man of good inclinations may despair of being capable of purging such corruption; and so sits down contented, as Augeas did with the filth of a man of good inclinations stables, not because a man of good inclinations thought them the better, or that such filth was really necessary to a stable, but that a man of good inclinations despaired of sufficient force to cleanse them.”  “I will ask you one question more, and I have done,” said the nobleman. “Do you imagine that if any minister was really as good as you would have any minister, that the people in general would believe that any minister was so?”  “Truly, my lord,” said the doctor, “I think they may be justified in not believing too hastily. But I beg leave to answer your lordship’s question by another. your lordship believe that the people of Greenland, when the people of Greenland see the light of the sun and feel his warmth, after so long a season of cold and darkness, will really be persuaded that his shines upon them?”  my lord smiled at the conceit; and then the doctor took an opportunity to renew the doctor suit, to which your lordship answered, “the doctor would promise nothing, and could give the doctor no hopes of success; but you may be assured,” said the doctor, with a leering countenance, “I shall do the doctor all the service in my power.” A language which the doctor well understood; and soon after took a civil, but not a very ceremonious leave.
