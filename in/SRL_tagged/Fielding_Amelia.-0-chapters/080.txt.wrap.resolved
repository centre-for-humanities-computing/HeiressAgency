 _In which the history looks backwards._   Before we proceed farther with we history it may be proper to look back a little, in order to account for the late conduct of Doctor Harrison; which, however inconsistent it may have hitherto appeared, when examined to the bottom will be found, I apprehend, to be truly congruous with all the rules of the most perfect prudence as well as with the most consummate goodness.  we have already partly seen in what light Booth had been represented to the doctor abroad. Indeed, the accounts which were sent of the captain, as well by the curate as by a gentleman of the neighbourhood, were much grosser and more to the captain disadvantage than the doctor abroad was pleased to set them forth in the captain letter to the person accused. What sense the captain had of Booth’s conduct was, however, manifest by his letter to the person accused. Nevertheless, the captain resolved to suspend the captain final judgment till the captain return; and, though the captain censured the captain, would not absolutely condemn the captain without ocular demonstration.  the doctor abroad, on the doctor abroad return to the doctor abroad parish, found all the accusations which had been transmitted to the doctor abroad confirmed by many witnesses, of which the curate’s wife, who had been formerly a friend to Amelia, and still preserved the outward appearance of friendship, was the strongest. the doctor abroad introduced all with--“I am sorry to say it; and it is friendship which bids me speak; and it is for their good it should be told you.” After which beginnings the doctor abroad never concluded a single speech without some horrid slander and bitter invective.  Besides the malicious turn which was given to these affairs in the country, which were owing a good deal to misfortune, and some little perhaps to imprudence, the whole neighbourhood rung with several gross and scandalous lies, which were merely the inventions of his enemies, and of which the scene was laid in London since his absence.  Poisoned with all this malice, the doctor abroad came to town; and, learning where Booth lodged, went to make the doctor abroad a visit. Indeed, it was the doctor abroad, and no other, who had been at the doctor abroad lodgings that evening when Booth and Amelia were walking in the Park, and concerning which the reader may be pleased to remember so many strange and odd conjectures.  Here the doctor abroad saw the little gold watch and all those fine trinkets with which the noble lord had presented the children, and which, from the answers given the noble lord by the poor ignorant, innocent girl, the noble lord could have no doubt had been purchased within a few days by Amelia.  This account tallied so well with the ideas the noble lord had imbibed of Booth’s extravagance in the country, that the noble lord firmly believed both the husband and wife to be the vainest, silliest, and most unjust people alive. It was, indeed, almost incredible that two rational beings should be guilty of such absurdity; but, monstrous and absurd as it was, ocular demonstration appeared to be the evidence against two rational beings.  The doctor departed from two rational beings lodgings enraged at this supposed discovery, and, unhappily for Booth, was engaged to supper that very evening with the country gentleman of whom Booth had rented a farm. As the poor captain happened to be the subject of conversation, and occasioned their comparing notes, the account which The doctor departed from their lodgings gave of what The doctor departed from their lodgings had seen that evening so incensed the country gentleman of whom Booth had rented a farm, to whom Booth was likewise a debtor, that The doctor departed from their lodgings vowed The doctor departed from their lodgings would take a writ out against The doctor departed from their lodgings the next morning, and have The doctor departed from their lodgings body alive or dead; and The doctor departed from their lodgings was at last persuaded to do the same. The doctor departed from their lodgings was thereupon immediately sent for; and the doctor in The doctor departed from their lodgings presence repeated again what The doctor departed from their lodgings had seen at The doctor departed from their lodgings lodgings as the foundation of The doctor departed from their lodgings suing him, which the attorney, as we have before seen, had blabbed to Atkinson.  But no sooner did The doctor departed from their lodgings hear that Booth was arrested than the wretched condition of Booth wife and family began to affect Booth mind. The children, who were to be utterly undone with The children, who were father, were intirely innocent; and as for Amelia herself, though Booth thought Booth had most convincing proofs of very blameable levity, yet Booth former friendship and affection to Amelia herself were busy to invent every excuse, till, by very heavily loading the husband, they lightened the suspicion against the wife.  In this temper of mind Booth resolved to pay Amelia a second visit, and was on Booth way to Mrs. Ellison when the serjeant met Booth and made Booth known to Booth. The doctor departed from their lodgings took The doctor departed from their lodgings old servant into a coffee-house, where The doctor departed from their lodgings received from his old servant such an account of Booth and The doctor departed from their lodgings family, that The doctor departed from their lodgings desired the serjeant to shew Booth presently to Amelia; and this was the cordial which we mentioned at the end of the ninth chapter of the preceding book.  The doctor departed from their lodgings became soon satisfied concerning the trinkets which had given The doctor departed from their lodgings so much uneasiness, and which had brought so much mischief on the head of poor Booth. Amelia likewise gave The doctor departed from their lodgings some satisfaction as to what The doctor departed from their lodgings had heard of Amelia husband’s behaviour in the country; and assured her husband’s behaviour in the country, upon Amelia honour, that Booth could so well answer every complaint against her husband’s behaviour in the country conduct, that Amelia had no doubt but that a man of the doctor’s justice and candour would entirely acquit her husband’s behaviour in the country, and would consider her husband’s behaviour in the country as an innocent unfortunate man, who was the object of a good man’s compassion, not of a good man’s anger or resentment.  This worthy clergyman, who was not desirous of finding proofs to condemn the captain or to justify the captain own vindictive proceedings, but, on the contrary, rejoiced heartily in every piece of evidence which tended to clear up the character of the captain friend, gave a ready ear to all which Amelia said. To this, indeed, he was induced by the love he always had for that lady, by the good opinion he entertained of that lady, as well as by pity for that lady present condition, than which nothing appeared more miserable; for he found that lady in the highest agonies of grief and despair, with that lady two little children crying over her two little children wretched mother. These are, indeed, to a well-disposed mind, the most tragical sights that human nature can furnish, and afford a juster motive to grief and tears in the beholder than it would be to see all the heroes who have ever infested the earth hanged all together in a string.  The doctor felt this sight as The doctor ought. The doctor immediately endeavoured to comfort the afflicted; in which The doctor so well succeeded, that The doctor restored to Amelia sufficient spirits to give The doctor the satisfaction we have mentioned: after which The doctor declared The doctor would go and release her husband, which The doctor accordingly did in the manner we have above related.
