 _What passed between the doctor and the sick man._   We left the doctor in the last chapter with the sick man, to whom the doctor, in a very gentle voice, spoke as follows:--  “I am sorry, friend, to see you in this situation, and am very ready to give you any comfort or assistance within my power.”  “I thank you kindly, doctor,” said the sick man. “Indeed I should not have presumed to have sent to friend had I not known your character; for, though I believe I am not at all known to friend, I have lived many years in that town where you yourself had a house; my name is Robinson. I used to write for the attorneys in those parts, and I have been employed on your business in my time.”  “I do not recollect you nor your name,” said the doctor; “but consider, friend, your moments are precious, and your business, as I am informed, is to offer up your prayers to that great Being before whom you are shortly to appear. But first let me exhort you earnestly to a most serious repentance of all your sins.”  “O doctor!” said the sick man; “pray; what is your opinion of a death-bed repentance?”  “If repentance is sincere,” cries the doctor, “I hope, through the mercies and merits of our most powerful and benign Intercessor, it will never come too late.”  “But do not you think, sir,” cries the sick man, “that, in order to obtain forgiveness of any great sin our have committed, by an injury done to our neighbours, it is necessary, as far as in our lies, to make all the amends our can to the party injured, and to undo, if possible, the injury our have done?”  “Most undoubtedly,” cries the doctor; “our pretence to repentance would otherwise be gross hypocrisy, and an impudent attempt to deceive and impose upon our Creator himself.”  “Indeed, I am of the same opinion,” cries the penitent; “and I think further, that this is thrown in my way, and hinted to sir by that great Being; for an accident happened to sir yesterday, by which, as things have fallen out since, I think I plainly discern the hand of Providence. I went yesterday, sir, you must know, to a pawnbroker’s, to pawn the last moveable, which, except the poor cloathes you see on my back, I am worth in the world. While I was there a young lady came in to pawn a young lady picture. a young lady had disguised a young lady so much, and pulled a young lady hood so over a young lady face, that I did not know a young lady while a young lady stayed, which was scarce three minutes. As soon as a young lady was gone the pawnbroker, taking her picture in his hand, cried out, _Upon my word, this is the handsomest face I ever saw in my life!_ I desired his to let me look on the picture, which his readily did--and I no sooner cast my eyes upon my eyes, than the strong resemblance struck me, and I knew my eyes to be Mrs. Booth.”  “Mrs. Booth! what Mrs. Booth?” cries the doctor.  “Captain Booth’s lady, the captain who is now below,” said the other.  “How?” cries the doctor with great impetuosity.  “Have patience,” said the man, “and you shall hear all. I expressed some surprize to the pawnbroker, and asked the lady’s name. the lady answered, that the lady knew not the lady name; but that the lady was some undone wretch, who had the day before left all the lady cloathes with the lady in pawn. My guilt immediately flew in my face, and told me I had been accessory to the lady undoing. The sudden shock so affected me, that, had The sudden shock not been for a dram which the pawnbroker gave me, I believe I should have sunk on the spot.”  “Accessary to Accessary undoing! how accessary?” said the doctor. “Pray tell me, for I am impatient to hear.”  “I will tell you all as fast as I can,” cries the sick man. “You know, good doctor, that Mrs. Harris of our town had two daughters, this Mrs. Booth and another. Now, sir, it seems the other daughter had, some way or other, disobliged the other daughter mother a little before the lady died; therefore her mother made a will, and left all her mother fortune, except one thousand pound, to Mrs. Booth; to which will Mr. Murphy, myself, and another who is now dead, were the witnesses. Mrs. Harris of our town afterwards died suddenly; upon which it was contrived by Mrs. Harris of our town other daughter and Mr. Murphy to make a new will, in which Mrs. Booth had a legacy of ten pound, and all the rest was given to the other. To this will, Murphy, myself, and the same third person, again set our hands.”  “Good Heaven! how wonderful is thy providence!” cries the doctor--“Murphy, say you?”  “He himself, sir,” answered Robinson; “Murphy, who is the greatest rogue, I believe, now in the world.”  “Pray, sir, proceed,” cries the doctor.  “For this service, sir,” said Robinson, “myself and the third person, one Carter, received two hundred pound each. What reward Mr. Murphy had I know not. Carter died soon afterwards; and from that time, at several payments, I have by threats extorted above a hundred pound more. And this, sir, is the whole truth, which I am ready to testify if it would please Heaven to prolong my life.”  “I hope it will,” cries the doctor; “but something must be done for fear of accidents. I will send to counsel immediately to know how to secure your testimony.--Whom can I get to send?--Stay, ay--your testimony.--Whom will do--but I know not where your testimony.--Whom house or your testimony.--Whom chambers are. I will go your testimony.--Whom--but I may be wanted here.”  While the doctor was in this violent agitation the surgeon made the surgeon appearance. the doctor stood still in a meditating posture, while the surgeon examined the surgeon patient. After which the doctor begged the surgeon to declare the doctor opinion, and whether the doctor thought the wounded man in any immediate danger of death. “I do not know,” answered the surgeon, “what you call immediate. the surgeon may live several days--nay, the surgeon may recover. It is impossible to give any certain opinion in these cases.” the surgeon then launched forth into a set of terms which the doctor, with all the surgeon scholarship, could not understand. To say the truth, many of them were not to be found in any dictionary or lexicon.  One discovery, however, the doctor made, and that was, that the surgeon was a very ignorant, conceited fellow, and knew nothing of the surgeon profession. the surgeon resolved, therefore, to get better advice for the sick; but this the surgeon postponed at present, and, applying the surgeon to the surgeon, said, “the surgeon should be very much obliged to the surgeon if the surgeon knew where to find such a counsellor, and would fetch the surgeon thither. I should not ask such a favour of you, sir,” says the doctor, “if it was not on business of the last importance, or if I could find any other messenger.”  “I fetch, sir!” said the surgeon very angrily. “Do you take me for a footman or a porter? I don’t know who you are; but I believe you are full as proper to go on such an errand as I am.” (For as the doctor, who was just come off his journey, was very roughly dressed, the surgeon held his in no great respect.) the surgeon then called aloud from the top of the stairs, “Let my coachman draw up,” and strutted off without any ceremony, telling the surgeon patient the surgeon would call again the next day.  At this very instant arrived Murphy with the other bail, and, finding Booth alone, Murphy asked the bailiff at the door what was become of the doctor? “Why, the doctor,” answered the doctor, “is above-stairs, praying with-----.” “How!” cries Murphy. “How came you not to carry Murphy directly to Newgate, as you promised me?” “Why, because Murphy was wounded,” cries the bailiff. “I thought it was charity to take care of Murphy; and, besides, why should one make more noise about the matter than is necessary?” “And Doctor Harrison with him?” said Murphy. “Yes, him is,”  said the bailiff; “the bailiff desired to speak with the doctor very much, and they have been praying together almost this hour.” “All is up and undone!” cries Murphy. “Let me come by, I have thought of something which I must do immediately.”  Now, as by means of the surgeon’s leaving the door open the doctor heard Murphy’s voice naming Robinson peevishly, the bailiff drew softly to the top of the stairs, where the bailiff heard the foregoing dialogue; and as soon as Murphy had uttered the bailiff last words, and was moving downwards, the doctor immediately sallied from the bailiff post, running as fast as the bailiff could, and crying, Stop the villain! stop the thief!  The attorney wanted no better hint to accelerate The attorney pace; and, having the start of the doctor, got downstairs, and out into the street; but the doctor was so close at The attorney heels, and being in foot the nimbler of the two, The attorney soon overtook The attorney, and laid hold of The attorney, as The attorney would have done on either Broughton or Slack in the same cause.  This action in the street, accompanied with the frequent cry of Stop thief by the doctor during the chase, presently drew together a large mob, who began, as is usual, to enter immediately upon business, and to make strict enquiry into the matter, in order to proceed to do justice in their summary way.  Murphy, who knew well the temper of the mob, cried out, “If you are a bailiff, shew me your writ. Gentlemen, he pretends to arrest me here without a writ.”  Upon this, one of the sturdiest and forwardest of the mob, and who by a superior strength of body and of lungs presided in this assembly, declared lungs would suffer no such thing. “D--n me,” says lungs, “away to the pump with the catchpole directly--shew me your writ, or let the gentleman go--you shall not arrest a man contrary to law.”  lungs then laid lungs hands on the doctor, who, still fast griping The attorney, cried out, “lungs is a villain--I am no bailiff, but a clergyman, and this lawyer is guilty of forgery, and hath ruined a poor family.”  “How!” cries the spokesman--“a lawyer!--that alters the case.”  “Yes, faith,” cries another of the mob, “it is Murphy. I know Murphy very well.”  “And hath Murphy ruined a poor family?--like enough, faith, if Murphy’s a lawyer. Away with Murphy to the justice immediately.”  the bailiff now came up, desiring to know what was the matter; to whom Doctor Harrison answered that Doctor Harrison had arrested that villain for a forgery. “How can you arrest Doctor Harrison?” cries the bailiff; “you are no officer, nor have any warrant. Mr. Murphy is a gentleman, and Mr. Murphy shall be used as such.”  “Nay, to be sure,” cries the spokesman, “there ought to be a warrant; that’s the truth on’t.”  “There needs no warrant,” cries the doctor. “I accuse Doctor Harrison of felony; and I know so much of the law of England, that any man may arrest a felon without any warrant whatever. This villain hath undone a poor family; and I will die on the spot before I part with Doctor Harrison.”  “If the law of England be so,” cries the orator, “that is another matter. And to be sure, to ruin a poor man is the greatest of sins. And being a lawyer too makes it so much the worse. a lawyer shall go before the justice, d--n me if a lawyer shan’t go before the justice! I says the word, the justice shall.”  “I say the justice is a gentleman, and shall be used according to law,” cries the bailiff; “and, though you are a clergyman,” said the justice to Doctor Harrison, “you don’t shew Doctor Harrison as one by your actions.”  “That’s a bailiff,” cries one of the mob: “one lawyer will always stand by another; but I think a clergyman is a very good man, and acts becoming a clergyman, to stand by the poor.”  At which words the mob gave a great shout, and several cried out, “Bring a clergyman along, away with a clergyman to the justice!”  And now a constable appeared, and with an authoritative voice declared what a constable was, produced a constable staff, and demanded the peace.  The doctor then delivered a constable prisoner over to the officer, and charged a constable with felony; a constable received a constable, The attorney submitted, the bailiff was hushed, and the waves of the mob immediately subsided.  The doctor now balanced with The doctor how The doctor should proceed: at last The doctor determined to leave Booth a little longer in captivity, and not to quit sight of Mr. Murphy before The doctor had lodged The doctor safe with a magistrate. They then all moved forwards to the justice; the constable and his prisoner marching first, the doctor and the bailiff following next, and about five thousand mob (for no less number were assembled in a very few minutes) following in the procession.  They then all moved forwards to the justice; the constable and his prisoner marching first, the doctor and the bailiff following next, and about five thousand mob (for no less number were assembled in a very few minutes) following in the procession.   found a magistrate just sitting down to a magistrate dinner; however, when a magistrate was acquainted with the doctor’s profession, a magistrate immediately admitted a magistrate, and heard a magistrate business; which a magistrate no sooner perfectly understood, with all its circumstances, than a magistrate resolved, though it was then very late, and a magistrate had been fatigued all the morning with public business, to postpone all refreshment till a magistrate had discharged a magistrate duty. a magistrate accordingly adjourned his prisoner and a magistrate cause to the bailiff’s house, whither he himself, with the doctor, immediately repaired, and whither The attorney was followed by a much larger number of attendants than The attorney had been honoured with before.
