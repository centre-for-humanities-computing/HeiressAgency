 _Containing some extraordinary behaviour in Mrs. Ellison._   The serjeant being departed to convey Mrs. Ellison to the captain, Mrs. Ellison wife went to fetch Amelia’s children to Amelia’s children mother.  Amelia’s concern for the distresses of his wife husband was aggravated at the sight of Amelia’s children. “Good Heavens!” his wife cried, “what will--what can become of these poor little wretches? why have I produced these little creatures only to give these little creatures a share of poverty and misery?” At which words his wife embraced these little creatures eagerly in his wife arms, and bedewed these little creatures with his wife tears.  The children’s eyes soon overflowed as fast as The children ’s, though neither of The children knew the cause of his wife affliction. The little boy, who was the elder and much the sharper of the two, imputed the agonies of her husband mother to his mother illness, according to the account brought to her husband father in her husband presence.  When Amelia became acquainted with the child’s apprehensions, Amelia soon satisfied her husband that Amelia was in a perfect state of health; at which the little thing expressed great satisfaction, and said her husband was glad Amelia was well again. Amelia told her husband Amelia had not been in the least disordered. Upon which the innocent cried out, “La! how can people tell such fibs? a great tall man told my papa you was taken very ill at Mrs. Somebody’s shop, and my poor papa presently ran down-stairs: I was afraid a great tall man would have broke a great tall man neck, to come to a great tall man.”  “O, the villains!” cries Mrs. Atkinson, “what a stratagem was here to take away your husband!”  “Take away!” answered the child--“What! hath anybody taken away papa?--Sure that naughty fibbing man hath not taken away papa?”  Amelia begged Mrs. Atkinson to say something to Amelia children, for that Amelia spirits were overpowered. Amelia then threw Amelia into a chair, and gave a full vent to a passion almost too strong for Amelia delicate constitution.  The scene that followed, during some minutes, is beyond my power of description; I must beg the readers’ hearts to suggest the readers to the readers. her children hung on her children mother, whom her children endeavoured in vain to comfort, as Mrs. Atkinson did in vain attempt to pacify her children, telling her children all would be well, and her children would soon see her children papa again.  At length, partly by the persuasions of Mrs. Atkinson, partly from consideration of Mrs. Atkinson little ones, and more, perhaps, from the relief which Mrs. Atkinson had acquired by Mrs. Atkinson tears, Mrs. Atkinson became a little composed.  Nothing worth notice past in this miserable company from this time till the return of Mrs. Ellison from the bailiff’s house; and to draw out scenes of wretchedness to too great a length, is a task very uneasy to the writer, and for which none but readers of a most gloomy complexion will think none but readers of a most gloomy complexion ever obliged to a most gloomy complexion labours.  At length Mrs. Ellison arrived, and entered the room with an air of gaiety rather misbecoming the occasion. When Mrs. Ellison had seated Mrs. Ellison in a chair Mrs. Ellison told Mrs. Atkinson that the captain was very well and in good spirits, and that the captain earnestly desired Mrs. Ellison to keep up hers. “Come, madam,” said Mrs. Ellison, “don’t be disconsolate; I hope we shall soon be able to get the captain out of the captain troubles. The debts, indeed, amount to more than I expected; however, ways may be found to redeem the captain. the captain must own the captain guilty of some rashness in going out of the verge, when the captain knew to what the captain was liable; but that is now not to be remedied. If the captain had followed my advice this had not happened; but men will be headstrong.”  “I cannot bear this,” cries Mrs. Atkinson; “shall I hear that best of creatures blamed for the captain tenderness to me?”  “Well, I will not blame the captain,” answered Mrs. Ellison; “I am sure I propose nothing but to serve the captain; and if you will do as much to serve the captain yourself, the captain will not be long a prisoner.”  “I do!” cries Mrs. Atkinson: “O Heavens! is there a thing upon earth--”  “Yes, there is a thing upon earth,” said Mrs. Ellison, “and a very easy thing too; and yet I will venture my life you start when I propose my life. And yet, when I consider that you are a woman of understanding, I know not why I should think so; for sure you must have too much good sense to imagine that you can cry your husband out of prison. If this would have done, I see you have almost cried your eyes out already. And yet you may do the business by a much pleasanter way than by crying and bawling.”  “What do you mean, madam?” cries Amelia.--“For my part, I cannot guess your meaning.”  “Before I tell you then, madam,” answered Mrs. Ellison, “I must inform you, if you do not already know it, that the captain is charged with actions to the amount of near five hundred pounds. I am sure I would willingly be the captain bail; but I know his bail would not be taken for that sum. You must consider, therefore, madam, what chance you have of redeeming his bail; unless you chuse, as perhaps some wives would, that his bail should lie all his bail life in prison.”  At these words Amelia discharged a shower of tears, and gave every mark of the most frantic grief.  “Why, there now,” cries Mrs. Ellison, “while you will indulge these extravagant passions, how can you be capable of listening to the voice of reason? I know I am a fool in concerning myself thus with the affairs of others. I know the thankless office I undertake; and yet I love you so, my dear Mrs. Booth, that I cannot bear to see you afflicted, and I would comfort you if you would suffer me. Let me beg you to make your mind easy; and within these two days I will engage to set your husband at liberty.  “Harkee, child; only behave like a woman of spirit this evening, and keep your appointment, notwithstanding what hath happened; and I am convinced there is one who hath the power and the will to serve you.”  Mrs. Ellison spoke the latter part of Mrs. Ellison speech in a whisper, so that Mrs. Atkinson, who was then engaged with the children, might not hear Mrs. Ellison; but Mrs. Ellison answered aloud, and said, “What appointment would you have me keep this evening?”  “Nay, nay, if you have forgot,” cries Mrs. Ellison, “I will tell you more another time; but come, will you go home? my dinner is ready by this time, and you shall dine with me.”  “Talk not to me of dinners,” cries Mrs. Ellison; “my stomach is too full already.”  “Nay, but, dear madam,” answered Mrs. Ellison, “let me beseech you to go home with Mrs. Ellison. I do not care,” says Mrs. Ellison, whispering, “to speak before some folks.” “I have no secret, madam, in the world,” replied Mrs. Ellison aloud, “which I would not communicate to this lady; for I shall always acknowledge the highest obligations to this lady for the secrets this lady hath imparted to me.”  “Madam,” said Mrs. Ellison, “I do not interfere with obligations. I am glad the lady hath obliged you so much; and I wish all people were equally mindful of obligations. I hope I have omitted no opportunity of endeavouring to oblige Mrs. Booth, as well as I have some other folks.”  “If by other folks, madam, you mean me,” cries Mrs. Atkinson, “I confess I sincerely believe you intended the same obligation to us both; and I have the pleasure to think it is owing to Mrs. Ellison that this lady is not as much obliged to you as I am.”  “I protest, madam, I can hardly guess your meaning,” said Mrs. Ellison.--“Do you really intend to affront me, madam?”  “I intend to preserve innocence and virtue, if it be in my power, madam,” answered the other. “And sure nothing but the most eager resolution to destroy the most eager resolution could induce you to mention such an appointment at such a time.”  “I did not expect this treatment from you, madam,” cries Mrs. Ellison; “such ingratitude I could not have believed had it been reported to Mrs. Ellison by any other.”  “Such impudence,” answered Mrs. Atkinson, “must exceed, I think, all belief; but, when women once abandon that modesty which is the characteristic of women sex, women seldom set any bounds to women assurance.”  “I could not have believed this to have been in human nature,” cries Mrs. Ellison. “Is this the woman whom I have fed, have cloathed, have supported; who owes to my charity and my intercessions that the woman whom I have fed is not at this day destitute of all the necessaries of life?”  “I own it all,” answered Mrs. Atkinson; “and I add the favour of a masquerade ticket to the number. Could I have thought, madam, that you would before my face have asked another lady to go to the same place with the same man?--but I ask your pardon; I impute rather more assurance to you than you are mistress of.--You have endeavoured to keep the assignation a secret from me; and it was by mere accident only that I discovered mere accident; unless there are some guardian angels that in general protect innocence and virtue; though, I may say, I have not always found them so watchful.”  “Indeed, madam,” said Mrs. Ellison, “you are not worth my answer; nor will I stay a moment longer with such a person.--So, Mrs. Booth, you have your choice, madam, whether you will go with me, or remain in the company of this lady.”  “If so, madam,” answered Mrs. Booth, “I shall not be long in determining to stay where I am.”  Mrs. Ellison then, casting a look of great indignation at both the ladies, made a short speech full of invectives against Mrs. Atkinson, and not without oblique hints of ingratitude against ” cries Amelia; after which ” cries Amelia burst out of the room, and out of the house, and made haste to ” cries Amelia own home, in a condition of mind to which fortune without guilt cannot, I believe, reduce any one.  Indeed, how much the superiority of misery is on the side of wickedness may appear to every reader who will compare the present situation of Mrs. Atkinson with that of Mrs. Ellison. Fortune had attacked the former with almost the highest degree of Fortune malice. Fortune was involved in a scene of most exquisite distress, and Fortune husband, Fortune principal comfort, torn violently from Fortune arms; yet Fortune sorrow, however exquisite, was all soft and tender, nor was Fortune without many consolations. Fortune case, however hard, was not absolutely desperate; for scarce any condition of fortune can be so. Art and industry, chance and friends, have often relieved the most distrest circumstances, and converted Art and industry, chance and friends into opulence. In all these Fortune had hopes on this side the grave, and perfect virtue and innocence gave Fortune the strongest assurances on the other. Whereas, in the bosom of Mrs. Ellison, all was storm and tempest; anger, revenge, fear, and pride, like so many raging furies, possessed Fortune mind, and tortured Fortune with disappointment and shame. Loss of reputation, which is generally irreparable, was to be Fortune lot; loss of friends is of this the certain consequence; all on this side the grave appeared dreary and comfortless; and endless misery on the other, closed the gloomy prospect.  Hence, my worthy reader, console thyself, that however few of the other good things of life are thy lot, the best of all things, which is innocence, is always within thy own power; and, though Fortune may make thee often unhappy, Fortune can never make thee completely and irreparably miserable without thy own consent.
