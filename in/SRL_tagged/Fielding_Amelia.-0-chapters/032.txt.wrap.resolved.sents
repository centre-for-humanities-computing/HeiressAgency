 _In which Mr. Booth concludes Mr. Booth story._   “The next day the doctor set out for the doctor parsonage, which was about thirty miles distant, whither Amelia and myself accompanied the doctor, and where we stayed with the doctor all the time of the doctor residence there, being almost three months.
“The situation of the parish under my good friend’s care is very pleasant.
The situation of the parish under my good friend is placed among meadows, washed by a clear trout-stream, and flanked on both sides with downs.
His house, indeed, would not much attract the admiration of the virtuoso.
His built His house His, and His house is remarkable only for His house plainness; with which the furniture so well agrees, that there is no one thing in it that may not be absolutely necessary, except books, and the prints of Mr. Hogarth, whom His calls a moral satirist.
“Nothing, however, can be imagined more agreeable than the life that the doctor leads in this homely house, which the doctor calls the doctor earthly paradise.
All the doctor parishioners, whom the doctor treats as the doctor children, regard the doctor as All his parishioners, whom he treats as his children common father.
Once in a week the doctor constantly visits every house in the parish, examines, commends, and rebukes, as the doctor finds occasion.
This is practised likewise by the doctor curate in the doctor absence; and so good an effect is produced by this their care, that no quarrels ever proceed either to blows or law-suits; no beggar is to be found in the parish; nor did I ever hear a very profane oath all the time I lived in no beggar.
“But to return from so agreeable a digression, to my own affairs, that are much less worth your attention.
In the midst of all the pleasures I tasted in this sweet place and in the most delightful company, the woman and man whom I loved above all things, melancholy reflexions concerning my unhappy circumstances would often steal into my thoughts.
My fortune was now reduced to less than forty pounds a-year; I had already two children, and my dear Amelia was again with child.
“One day the doctor found me sitting by myself, and employed in melancholy contemplations on this subject.
the doctor told me the doctor had observed me growing of late very serious; that the doctor knew the occasion, and neither wondered at nor blamed me.
the doctor then asked me if I had any prospect of going again into the army; if not, what scheme of life I proposed to myself?
“I told the doctor that, as I had no powerful friends, I could have but little expectations in a military way; that I was as incapable of thinking of any other scheme, as all business required some knowledge or experience, and likewise money to set up with; of all which I was destitute.
“‘You must know then, child,’ said the doctor, ‘that I have been thinking on this subject as well as you; for I can think, I promise you, with a pleasant countenance.’ These were his words.
‘As to the army, perhaps means might be found of getting you another commission; but my daughter seems to have a violent objection to you another commission; and to be plain, I fancy you yourself will find no glory make you amends for your absence from my daughter.
And for my part,’ said he, ‘I never think those men wise who, for any worldly interest, forego the greatest happiness of those men lives.
If I mistake not,’ says he, ‘a country life, where you could be always together, would make you both much happier people.’  “I answered, that of all things I preferred it most; and I believed Amelia was of the same opinion.
“The doctor, after a little hesitation, proposed to me to turn farmer, and offered to let me The doctor parsonage, which was then become vacant.
The doctor said it was a farm which required but little stock, and that little should not be wanting.
“I embraced this offer very eagerly, and with great thankfulness, and immediately repaired to Amelia to communicate this offer to Amelia, and to know Amelia sentiments.
“Amelia received the news with the highest transports of joy; Amelia said that Amelia greatest fear had always been of my entring again into the army.
Amelia was so kind as to say that all stations of life were equal to Amelia, unless as one afforded Amelia more of my company than another.
‘And as to our children,’ said Amelia, ‘let our breed our children up to an humble fortune, and our children will be contented with it; for none,’ added my angel, ‘deserve happiness, or, indeed, are capable of it, who make any particular station a necessary ingredient.’”  “Thus, madam, you see me degraded from my former rank in life; no longer Captain Booth, but farmer Booth at your service.
“During my first year’s continuance in this new scene of life, nothing, I think, remarkable happened; the history of one day would, indeed, be the history of the whole year.”  “Well, pray then,” said Miss Matthews, “do let “ hear the history of that day; I have a strange curiosity to know how you could kill your time; and do, if possible, find out the very best day you can.”  “If you command me, madam,” answered Captain Booth, “you must yourself be accountable for the dulness of the narrative.
Nay, I believe, you have imposed a very difficult task on me; for the greatest happiness is incapable of description.
“I rose then, madam--”  “O, the moment you waked, undoubtedly,” said Miss Matthews.
“Usually,” said Miss Matthews, “between five and six.”  “I will have no usually,” cried Miss Matthews, “you are confined to a day, and it is to be the best and happiest in my first year.”  “Nay, madam,” cries Captain Booth, “then I must tell you the day in which Amelia was brought to bed, after a painful and dangerous labour; for that I think was the happiest day of my life.”  “I protest,” said Amelia, “you are become farmer Booth, indeed.
What a happiness have you painted to my imagination!
you put me in mind of a newspaper, where my lady such-a-one is delivered of a son, to the great joy of some illustrious family.”  “Why then, I do assure you, Miss Miss Matthews,” cries Captain Booth, “I scarce know a circumstance that distinguished one day from another.
The whole was one continued series of love, health, and tranquillity.
Our lives resembled a calm sea.”--  “The dullest of all ideas,” cries my lady such-a-one.
“I know,” said he, “it must appear dull in description, for who can describe the pleasures which the morning air gives to one in perfect health; the flow of spirits which springs up from exercise; the delights which parents feel from the prattle and innocent follies of parents children; the joy with which the tender smile of a wife inspires a husband; or lastly, the chearful, solid comfort which a fond couple enjoy in each other’s conversation?--All these pleasures and every other of which our situation was capable our tasted in the highest degree.
our happiness was, perhaps, too great; for fortune seemed to grow envious of Our happiness, and interposed one of the most cruel accidents that could have befallen our by robbing our of our dear friend the doctor.”  “I am sorry for it,” said Miss Matthews.
“Miss Matthews was indeed a valuable man, and I never heard of Miss Matthews death before.”  “Long may it be before any one hears of it!” cries Booth.
“Miss Matthews is, indeed, dead to our; but will, I hope, enjoy many happy years of life.
You know, madam, the obligations Miss Matthews had to Miss Matthews patron the earl; indeed, it was impossible to be once in Miss Matthews company without hearing of You know, madam, the obligations he had to his patron the earl.
I am sure you will neither wonder that Miss Matthews was chosen to attend the young lord in Miss Matthews travels as Miss Matthews tutor, nor that the good man, however disagreeable it might be (as in fact it was) to Miss Matthews inclination, should comply with the earnest request of Miss Matthews friend and patron.
“By this means I was bereft not only of the best companion in the world, but of the best counsellor; a loss of which I have since felt the bitter consequence; for no greater advantage, I am convinced, can arrive to a young man, who hath any degree of understanding, than an intimate converse with one of riper years, who is not only able to advise, but who knows the manner of advising.
By this means alone, youth can enjoy the benefit of the experience of age, and that at a time of life when such experience will be of more service to a man than when a man hath lived long enough to acquire it of a man.
“From want of my sage counsellor, I now fell into many errors.
The first of these was in enlarging my business, by adding a farm of one hundred a year to the parsonage, in renting which I had also as bad a bargain as the doctor had before given me a good one.
The consequence of which was, that whereas, at the end of the first year, I was worth upwards of fourscore pounds; at the end of the second I was near half that sum worse (as the phrase is) than nothing.
“A second folly I was guilty of in uniting families with the curate of the parish, who had just married, as my wife and I thought, a very good sort of a woman.
my wife and I had not, however, lived one month together before I plainly perceived this good sort of a woman had taken a great prejudice against my my dear Amelia, for which, if I had not known something of the human passions, and that high place which envy holds among them, I should not have been able to account, for, so far was my angel from having given a woman any cause of dislike, that a woman had treated a woman not only with civility, but kindness.
“Besides superiority in beauty, which, I believe, all the world would have allowed to Amelia, there was another cause of this envy, which I am almost ashamed to mention, as it may well be called my greatest folly.
You are to know then, madam, that from a boy I had been always fond of driving a coach, in which I valued myself on having some skill.
This, perhaps, was an innocent, but I allow This to have been a childish vanity.
As I had an opportunity, therefore, of buying an old coach and harness very cheap (indeed they cost me but twelve pounds), and as I considered that the same horses which drew my waggons would likewise draw my coach, I resolved on indulging myself in the purchase.
“The consequence of setting up this poor old coach is inconceivable.
Before this, as my wife and myself had very little distinguished ourselves from the other farmers and their wives, either in ourselves dress or ourselves way of living, their treated ourselves as their equals; but now their began to consider ourselves as elevating ourselves into a state of superiority, and immediately began to envy, hate, and declare war against ourselves.
The neighbouring little squires, too, were uneasy to see a poor renter become The neighbouring little squires equal in a matter in which The neighbouring little squires placed so much dignity; and, not doubting but it arose in myself from the same ostentation, The neighbouring little squires began to hate me likewise, and to turn my equipage into ridicule, asserting that my horses, which were as well matched as any in the kingdom, were of different colours and sizes, with much more of that kind of wit, the only basis of which is lying.
“But what will appear most surprizing to you, madam, was, that the curate’s wife, who, being lame, had more use of this poor old coach than Amelia (indeed Amelia seldom went to church in any other manner), was one of my bitterest enemies on the occasion.
If Amelia had ever any dispute with Amelia, which all the sweetness of Amelia could not sometimes avoid, Amelia was sure to introduce with a malicious sneer, ‘Though my husband doth not keep a coach, madam.’ Nay, Amelia took this opportunity to upbraid my wife with the loss of Amelia fortune, alledging that some folks might have had as good pretensions to a coach as other folks, and a better too, as some folks brought a better fortune to some folks husbands, but that all people had not the art of making brick without straw.
“You will wonder, perhaps, madam, how I can remember such stuff, which, indeed, was a long time only matter of amusement to both Amelia and myself; but we at last experienced the mischievous nature of envy, and that it tends rather to produce tragical than comical events.
My neighbours now began to conspire against myself.
My neighbours nicknamed me in derision, the Squire Farmer.
Whatever I bought, I was sure to buy dearer, and when I sold I was obliged to sell cheaper, than any other.
In fact, My neighbours were all united, and, while My neighbours every day committed trespasses on my lands with impunity, if any of my cattle escaped into their fields, I was either forced to enter into a law-suit or to make amends fourfold for the damage sustained.
“The consequences of all this could be no other than that ruin which ensued.
Without tiring you with particulars, before the end of four years I became involved in debt near three hundred pounds more than the value of all my effects.
My landlord seized my stock for rent, and, to avoid immediate confinement in prison, I was forced to leave the country with all that I hold dear in the world, my wife and my poor little family.
“In this condition I arrived in town five or six days ago.
I had just taken a lodging in the verge of the court, and had writ my dear Amelia word where Amelia might find me, when Amelia had settled Amelia affairs in the best manner Amelia could.
That very evening, as I was returning home from a coffee-house, a fray happening in the street, I endeavoured to assist the injured party, when I was seized by the watch, and, after being confined all night in the round-house, was conveyed in the morning before a justice of peace, who committed me hither; where I should probably have starved, had I not from your hands found a most unaccountable preservation.--And here, give me leave to assure you, my dear Miss Matthews, that, whatever advantage I may have reaped from your misfortune, I sincerely lament it; nor would I have purchased any relief to my dear Miss Matthews at the price of seeing you in this dreadful place.”  He spake these last words with great tenderness; for He was a man of consummate good nature, and had formerly had much affection for this young lady; indeed, more than the generality of people are capable of entertaining for any person whatsoever.
