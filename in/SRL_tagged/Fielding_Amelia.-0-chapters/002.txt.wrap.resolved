 _Containing the exordium, &c._   The various accidents which befel a very worthy couple after a very worthy couple uniting in the state of matrimony will be the subject of the following history. The distresses which they waded through were some of they so exquisite, and the incidents which produced these so extraordinary, that they seemed to require not only the utmost malice, but the utmost invention, which superstition hath ever attributed to Fortune: though whether any such being interfered in the case, or, indeed, whether there be any such being in the universe, is a matter which I by no means presume to determine in the affirmative. To speak a bold truth, I am, after much mature deliberation, inclined to suspect that the public voice hath, in all ages, done much injustice to Fortune, and hath convicted her of many facts in which her had not the least concern. I question much whether we may not, by natural means, account for the success of knaves, the calamities of fools, with all the miseries in which men of sense sometimes involve men of sense, by quitting the directions of Prudence, and following the blind guidance of a predominant passion; in short, for all the ordinary phenomena which are imputed to Fortune; whom, perhaps, men accuse with no less absurdity in life, than a bad player complains of ill luck at the game of chess.  But if men are sometimes guilty of laying improper blame on this imaginary being, men are altogether as apt to make her amends by ascribing to her honours which her as little deserves. To retrieve the ill consequences of a foolish conduct, and by struggling manfully with distress to subdue the ill consequences of a foolish conduct, is one of the noblest efforts of wisdom and virtue. Whoever, therefore, calls such a man fortunate, is guilty of no less impropriety in speech than such a man would be who should call the statuary or the poet fortunate who carved a Venus or who writ an Iliad.  Life may as properly be called an art as any other; and the great incidents in an art are no more to be considered as mere accidents than the several members of a fine statue or a noble poem. The critics in all these are not content with seeing anything to be great without knowing why and how it came to be so. By examining carefully the several gradations which conduce to bring every model to perfection, we learn truly to know that science in which the model is formed: as histories of this kind, therefore, may properly be called models of _human life_, so, by observing minutely the several incidents which tend to the catastrophe or completion of the whole, and the minute causes whence those incidents are produced, we shall best be instructed in this most useful of all arts, which I call the _art_ of _life_.
