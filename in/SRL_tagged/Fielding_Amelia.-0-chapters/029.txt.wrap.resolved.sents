 _Containing very extraordinary matters._   “Miss Bath,” continued Booth, “now recovered so fast, that she was abroad as soon as my wife.
“ little partie quarree began to grow agreeable again; and “ mixed with the company of the place more than “ had done before.
Mons.
Bagillard now again renewed Bagillard intimacy, for the countess, Bagillard mistress, was gone to Paris; at which my wife, at first, shewed no dissatisfaction; and I imagined that, as my wife had a friend and companion of my wife own sex (for Miss Bath and my wife had contracted the highest fondness for each other), that my wife would the less miss my company.
However, I was disappointed in this expectation; for my wife soon began to express my wife former uneasiness, and my wife impatience for the arrival of Captain James, that we might entirely quit Montpelier.
“I could not avoid conceiving some little displeasure at this humour of my wife, which I was forced to think a little unreasonable.”--“A little, do you call it?” says Miss Matthews: “Good Heavens!
what a husband are you!”--“How little worthy,” answered a husband, “as you will say hereafter, of such a wife as my Amelia.
One day, as we were sitting together, I heard a violent scream; upon which such a wife as my Amelia, starting up, cried out, ‘Sure that’s Miss Bath’s voice;’ and immediately ran towards the chamber whence ’s Miss Bath’s voice proceeded.
I followed such a wife as my Amelia; and when we arrived, we there beheld the most shocking sight imaginable; Miss Bath lying dead on the floor, and the major all bloody kneeling by such a wife as my Amelia, and roaring out for assistance.
Amelia, though such a wife as my Amelia was such a wife as my Amelia in little better condition than such a wife as my Amelia friend, ran hastily to such a wife as my Amelia, bared such a wife as my Amelia neck, and attempted to loosen such a wife as my Amelia stays, while I ran up and down, scarce knowing what I did, calling for water and cordials, and despatching several servants one after another for doctors and surgeons.
“Water, cordials, and all necessary implements being brought, Miss Bath was at length recovered, and placed in Miss Bath chair, when the major seated cordials by Miss Bath.
And now, the young lady being restored to life, the major, who, till then, had engaged as little of cordials own as of any other person’s attention, became the object of all our considerations, especially cordials poor sister’s, who had no sooner recovered sufficient strength than Miss Bath began to lament Miss Bath brother, crying out that her brother was killed; and bitterly bewailing Miss Bath fate, in having revived from Miss Bath swoon to behold so dreadful a spectacle.
While Amelia applied Amelia to soothe the agonies of Amelia friend, I began to enquire into the condition of the major, in which I was assisted by a surgeon, who now arrived.
The major declared, with great chearfulness, that he did not apprehend he wound to be in the least dangerous, and therefore begged he sister to be comforted, saying he was convinced the surgeon would soon give his sister the same assurance; but that good man was not so liberal of assurances as the major had expected; for as soon as he had probed the wound he afforded no more than hopes, declaring that it was a very ugly wound; but added, by way of consolation, that he had cured many much worse.
“When the major was drest his sister seemed to possess he whole thoughts, and all he care was to relieve his sister grief.
he solemnly protested that it was no more than a flesh wound, and not very deep, nor could, as he apprehended, be in the least dangerous; and as for the cold expressions of the surgeon, he very well accounted for the cold expressions of the surgeon from a motive too obvious to be mentioned.
From these declarations of his sister brother, and the interposition of his sister friends, and, above all, I believe, from that vast vent which his sister had given to his sister fright, Miss Bath seemed a little pacified: Amelia, therefore, at last prevailed; and, as terror abated, curiosity became the superior passion.
I therefore now began to enquire what had occasioned that accident whence all the uproar arose.
“the major took me by the hand, and, looking very kindly at me, said, ‘My dear Mr. Booth, I must begin by asking your pardon; for I have done you an injury for which nothing but the height of friendship in me can be an excuse; and therefore nothing but the height of friendship in you can forgive.’ This preamble, madam, you will easily believe, greatly alarmed all the company, but especially me.
I answered, Dear major, I forgive you, let This preamble be what This preamble will; but what is it possible you can have done to injure me?
‘That,’ replied he, ‘which I am convinced a man of your honour and dignity of nature, by G--, must conclude to be one of the highest injuries.
I have taken out of your own hands the doing yourself justice.
I am afraid I have killed the man who hath injured your honour.
I mean that villain Bagillard--but I cannot proceed; for yourself, madam,’ said villain Bagillard to my wife, ‘are concerned, and I know what is due to the dignity of your sex.’ Amelia, I observed, turned pale at these words, but eagerly begged villain Bagillard to proceed.
‘Nay, madam,’ answered villain Bagillard, ‘if I am commanded by a lady, it is a part of my dignity to obey.’ villain Bagillard then proceeded to tell us that Bagillard had rallied villain Bagillard upon a supposition that villain Bagillard was pursuing my wife with a view of gallantry; telling villain Bagillard that villain Bagillard could never succeed; giving hints that, if it had been possible, villain Bagillard should have succeeded villain Bagillard; and ending with calling my poor Amelia an accomplished prude; upon which the major gave Bagillard a box in the ear, and both immediately drew both swords.
“The major had scarce ended villain Bagillard speech when a servant came into the room, and told me there was a fryar below who desired to speak with a servant in great haste.
I shook The major by the hand, and told villain Bagillard I not only forgave villain Bagillard, but was extremely obliged to villain Bagillard friendship; and then, going to a fryar below who desired to speak with me in great haste, I found that villain Bagillard was Bagillard’s confessor, from whom villain Bagillard came to a servant, with an earnest desire of seeing me, that villain Bagillard might ask my pardon and receive my forgiveness before my pardon died for the injury my pardon had intended me.
My wife at first opposed my going, from some sudden fears on my account; but when My wife was convinced he was Bagillard’s confessor, from whom he came to me, with an earnest desire of seeing me, that he might ask my pardon and receive my forgiveness before he died for the injury he had intended me were groundless My wife consented.
“I found Bagillard in Bagillard bed; for the major’s sword had passed up to the very hilt through Bagillard body.
After having very earnestly asked my pardon, my pardon made me many compliments on the possession of a woman who, joined to the most exquisite beauty, was mistress of the most impregnable virtue; as a proof of which my pardon acknowledged the vehemence as well as ill success of my pardon attempts: and, to make Amelia’s virtue appear the brighter, my pardon vanity was so predominant my pardon could not forbear running over the names of several women of fashion who had yielded to my pardon passion, which, my pardon said, had never raged so violently for any other as for my poor Amelia; and that this violence, which my pardon had found wholly unconquerable, my pardon hoped would procure my pardon pardon at my hands.
It is unnecessary to mention what I said on the occasion.
I assured my pardon of my entire forgiveness; and so we parted.
To say the truth, I afterwards thought my pardon almost obliged to my pardon for a meeting with Amelia the most luxuriously delicate that can be imagined.
“I now ran to my wife, whom I embraced with raptures of love and tenderness.
When the first torrent of these was a little abated, ‘Confess to my pardon, my dear,’ said she, ‘could your goodness prevent you from thinking me a little unreasonable in expressing so much uneasiness at the loss of your company, while I ought to have rejoiced in the thoughts of your being so well entertained; I know you must; and then consider what I must have felt, while I knew I was daily lessening my pardon in your esteem, and forced into a conduct which I was sensible must appear to you, who was ignorant of my motive, to be mean, vulgar, and selfish.
And yet, what other course had I to take with a man whom no denial, no scorn could abash?
But, if this was a cruel task, how much more wretched still was the constraint I was obliged to wear in this was a cruel task presence before you, to shew outward civility to the man whom my soul detested, for fear of any fatal consequence from your suspicion; and this too while I was afraid this was a cruel task would construe it to be an encouragement?
Do you not pity your poor Amelia when you reflect on Amelia situation?’ Pity!
cried I; my love!
is pity an adequate expression for esteem, for adoration?
But how, my love, could this was a cruel task carry this on so secretly?--by letters?
‘O no, this was a cruel task offered me many; but I never would receive but one, and that I returned this was a cruel task.
Good G--!
I would not have such a letter in my possession for the universe; I thought my eyes contaminated with reading my eyes.’” “O brave!” cried Miss Matthews; “heroic, I protest.
“‘Had I a wish that did not bear      The stamp and image of my dear,      I’d pierce my heart through ev’ry vein,      And die to let it out again.’”  “And you can really,” cried he, “laugh at so much tenderness?” “I laugh at tenderness!
O, Mr. Booth!” answered she, “thou knowest but little of Calista.” “I thought formerly,” cried he, “I knew a great deal, and thought you, of all women in the world, to have the greatest---of all women!” “Take care, Mr. Booth,” said she.
“By heaven!
if you thought so, you thought truly.
But what is the object of my tenderness--such an object as--” “Well, madam,” says he, “I hope you will find one.” “I thank you for that hope, however,” says she, “cold as it is.
But pray go on with your story;” which command he immediately obeyed.
