 _In which Miss Matthews begins Miss Matthews history._   Miss Matthews, having barred the door on the inside as securely as it was before barred on the outside, proceeded as follows:  “You may imagine I am going to begin her history at the time when you left the country; but I cannot help reminding you of something which happened before. You will soon recollect the incident; but I believe you little know the consequence either at that time or since. Alas! I could keep a secret then! now I have no secrets; the world knows all; and it is not worth my while to conceal anything. Well!--You will not wonder, I believe.--I protest I can hardly tell it you, even now.---But I am convinced you have too good an opinion of yourself to be surprized at any conquest you may have made.---Few men want that good opinion--and perhaps very few had ever more reason for that good opinion--. Indeed, Will, you was a charming fellow in those days; nay, you are not much altered for the worse now, at least in the opinion of some women; for your complexion and features are grown much more masculine than your complexion and features were.” Here Booth made Booth a low bow, most probably with a compliment; and after a little hesitation Booth again proceeded.---“Do you remember a contest which happened at an assembly, betwixt myself and Miss Johnson, about standing uppermost? you was then my partner; and young Williams danced with the other lady. The particulars are not now worth mentioning, though I suppose you have long since forgot The particulars. Let it suffice that you supported my claim, and Williams very sneakingly gave up that of Williams partner, who was, with much difficulty, afterwards prevailed to dance with Williams. You said--I am sure I repeat the words exactly--that you would not for the world affront any lady there; but that you thought you might, without any such danger declare, that there was no assembly in which that lady, meaning your humble servant, was not worthy of the uppermost place; ‘nor will I,’ said you, ‘suffer, the first duke in England, when she is at the uppermost end of the room, and hath called she dance, to lead Williams above she.’  “What made this the more pleasing to myself was, that I secretly hated Miss Johnson. Will you have the reason? why, then, I will tell you honestly, she was my rival. That word perhaps astonishes you, as you never, I believe, heard of any one who made That word addresses to myself; and indeed my heart was, till that night, entirely indifferent to all mankind: I mean, then, that she was my rival for praise, for beauty, for dress, for fortune, and consequently for admiration. My triumph on this conquest is not to be expressed any more than my delight in the person to whom I chiefly owed it. The former, I fancy, was visible to the whole company; and I desired it should be so; but the latter was so well concealed, that no one, I am confident, took any notice of it. And yet you appeared to myself that night to be an angel. You looked, you danced, you spoke-everything charmed me.”  “Good Heavens!” cries Booth, “is it possible you should do me so much unmerited honour, and I should be dunce enough not to perceive the least symptom?”  “I assure you,” answered she, “I did all I could to prevent you; and yet I almost hated you for not seeing through what I strove to hide. Why, Booth, was you not more quick-sighted?--I will answer for myself--your affections were more happily disposed of to a much better woman than myself, whom you married soon afterwards. I should ask you for she, Booth; I should have asked you for she before; but I am unworthy of asking for she, or of calling she my acquaintance.”  Booth stopt she short, as she was running into another fit of passion, and begged she to omit all former matters, and acquaint Booth with that part of she history to which Booth was an entire stranger.  she then renewed she discourse as follows: “You know, Booth, I soon afterwards left that town, upon the death of my grandmother, and returned home to my father’s house; where I had not been long arrived before some troops of dragoons came to quarter in our neighbourhood. Among the officers there was a cornet whose detested name was Hebbers, a name I could scarce repeat, had I not at the same time the pleasure to reflect that he is now no more. My father, you know, who is a hearty well-wisher to the present government, used always to invite the officers to ’s house; so did his these. Nor was it long before this cornet in so particular a manner recommended his to the poor old gentleman (I cannot think of his without tears), that ’s house became his principal habitation, and his was rarely at his quarters, unless when his superior officers obliged his to be there. I shall say nothing of his person, nor could that be any recommendation to a man; it was such, however, as no woman could have made an objection to. Nature had certainly wrapt up no woman odious work in a most beautiful covering. To say the truth, he was the handsomest man, except one only, that I ever saw--I assure you, I have seen a handsomer---but--well.--He had, besides, all the qualifications of a gentleman; was genteel and extremely polite; spoke French well, and danced to a miracle; but what chiefly recommended his to my father was his skill in music, of which you know that dear man was the most violent lover. I wish his was not too susceptible of flattery on that head; for I have heard Hebbers often greatly commend my father’s performance, and have observed that the good man was wonderfully pleased with such commendations. To say the truth, it is the only way I can account for the extraordinary friendship which my father conceived for this person; such a friendship, that my father at last became a part of our family.  “This very circumstance, which, as I am convinced, strongly recommended my father to my father, had the very contrary effect with I am: I had never any delight in music, and it was not without much difficulty I was prevailed on to learn to play on the harpsichord, in which I had made a very slender progress. As this man, therefore, was frequently the occasion of my being importuned to play against my will, I began to entertain some dislike for this man on that account; and as to this man person, I assure you, I long continued to look on that account with great indifference.  “How strange will the art of this man appear to you presently, who had sufficient address to convert that very circumstance which had at first occasioned my dislike into the first seeds of affection for this man!  “You have often, I believe, heard my sister Betty play on the harpsichord; my sister Betty was, indeed, reputed the best performer in the whole country.  “I was the farthest in the world from regarding this perfection of hers with envy. In reality, perhaps, I despised all perfection of this kind: at least, as I had neither skill nor ambition to excel this way, I looked upon it as a matter of mere indifference.  “Hebbers first put this emulation in my head. Hebbers took great pains to persuade me that I had much greater abilities of the musical kind than my sister Betty, and that I might with the greatest ease, if I pleased, excel my sister Betty; offering me, at the same time, Hebbers assistance if I would resolve to undertake it.  “When Hebbers had sufficiently inflamed my ambition, in which, perhaps, Hebbers found too little difficulty, the continual praises of my sister, which before I had disregarded, became more and more nauseous in my ears; and the rather, as, music being the favourite passion of my father, I became apprehensive (not without frequent hints from Hebbers of that nature) that my sister Betty might gain too great a preference in Hebbers favour.  “To my harpsichord then I applied myself night and day, with such industry and attention, that I soon began to perform in a tolerable manner. I do not absolutely say I excelled my sister Betty, for many were of a different opinion; but, indeed, there might be some partiality in all that.  “Hebbers, at least, declared Hebbers on my side, and nobody could doubt Hebbers judgment. Hebbers asserted openly that I played in the better manner of the two; and one day, when I was playing to Hebbers alone, Hebbers affected to burst into a rapture of admiration, and, squeezing me gently by the hand, said, There, madam, I now declare you excel my sister Betty as much in music as, added Hebbers in a whispering sigh, you do my sister Betty, and all the world, in every other charm.  “my sister Betty can bear any superiority in whatever thing my sister Betty desires to excel in. I now began to hate all the admirers of my sister Betty, to be uneasy at every commendation bestowed on my sister Betty skill in music, and consequently to love Hebbers for the preference which Hebbers gave to mine.  “It was now that I began to survey the handsome person of Hebbers with pleasure. And here, Mr. Booth, I will betray to you the grand secret of our sex.---Many women, I believe, do, with great innocence, and even with great indifference, converse with men of the finest persons; but this I am confident may be affirmed with truth, that, when once a woman comes to ask this question of a woman, Is the man whom I like for some other reason, handsome? a woman fate and the man whom I like for some other reason too, very strongly depend on a woman answering in the affirmative.  “Hebbers no sooner perceived that Hebbers had made an impression on my heart, of which I am satisfied I gave Hebbers too undeniable tokens, than Hebbers affected on a sudden to shun me in the most apparent manner. Hebbers wore the most melancholy air in my presence, and, by Hebbers dejected looks and sighs, firmly persuaded me that there was some secret sorrow labouring in Hebbers bosom; nor will it be difficult for you to imagine to what cause I imputed it.  “Whilst I was wishing for his declaration of a passion in which I thought I could not be mistaken, and at the same time trembling whenever we met with the apprehension of this very declaration, the widow Carey came from London to make we a visit, intending to stay the whole summer at we .  “Those who know Mrs. Carey will scarce think I do Mrs. Carey an injury in saying Mrs. Carey is far from being handsome; and yet Mrs. Carey is as finished a coquette as if Mrs. Carey had the highest beauty to support that character. But perhaps you have seen Mrs. Carey; and if you have I am convinced you will readily subscribe to my opinion.”  Booth answered Booth had not; and then Mrs. Carey proceeded as in the following chapter.
