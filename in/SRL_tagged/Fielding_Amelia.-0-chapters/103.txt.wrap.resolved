 _Containing more wormwood and other ingredients._   In the morning Booth communicated the matter to Amelia, who told Booth she would not presume to advise Booth in an affair of which Booth was so much the better judge.  While Booth remained in a doubtful state what conduct to pursue Bound came to make Booth a visit, and informed Booth that Booth had been at Trent’s house, but found Booth not at home, adding that Booth would pay Booth a second visit that very day, and would not rest till Booth found Booth.  Booth was ashamed to confess Booth wavering resolution in an affair in which Booth had been so troublesome to Booth friend; Booth therefore dressed Booth immediately, and together they both went to wait on the little great man, to whom Booth now hoped to pay Booth court in the most effectual manner.  Bound had been longer acquainted with the modern methods of business than Booth; Booth advised his friend, therefore, to begin with tipping (as it is called) the great man’s servant. the great man’s servant did so, and by that means got speedy access to the master.  the great man’s servant received the money, not as a gudgeon doth a bait, but as a pike receives a poor gudgeon into the great man’s servant maw. To say the truth, such fellows as these may well be likened to that voracious fish, who fattens himself by devouring all the little inhabitants of the river. As soon as the great man’s servant had pocketed the cash, himself shook Booth by the hand, and told himself himself would be sure to slip no opportunity of serving himself, and would send himself word as soon as any offered.  Here I shall stop one moment, and so, perhaps, will my good-natured reader; for surely it must be a hard heart which is not affected with reflecting on the manner in which this poor little sum was raised, and on the manner in which it was bestowed. A worthy family, the wife and children of a man who had lost his blood abroad in the service of his country, parting with A worthy family, the wife and children of a man who had lost his blood abroad in the service of his country little all, and exposed to cold and hunger, to pamper such a fellow as this!  And if any such reader as I mention should happen to be in reality a great man, and in power, perhaps the horrour of this picture may induce his to put a final end to this abominable practice of touching, as it is called; by which, indeed, a set of leeches are permitted to suck the blood of the brave and the indigent, of the widow and the orphan.  Booth now returned home, where Booth found Amelia with Mrs. James. Amelia had, before the arrival of Amelia husband, absolutely refused Mrs. James’s invitation to dinner the next day; but when Booth came in the lady renewed Booth application, and that in so pressing a manner, that Booth seconded Amelia; for, though Booth had enough of jealousy in Booth temper, yet such was Booth friendship to the colonel, and such Booth gratitude to the obligations which Booth had received from Booth, that Booth own unwillingness to believe anything of Booth, co-operating with Amelia’s endeavours to put everything in the fairest light, had brought Booth to acquit Booth friend of any ill design. To this, perhaps, the late affair concerning my lord had moreover contributed; for it seems to me that the same passion cannot much energize on two different objects at one and the same time: an observation which, I believe, will hold as true with regard to the cruel passions of jealousy and anger as to the gentle passion of love, in which one great and mighty object is sure to engage the whole passion.  When Booth grew importunate, Amelia answered, “My dear, I should not refuse you whatever was in my power; but this is absolutely out of my power; for since I must declare the truth, I cannot dress me.”  “Why so?” said Mrs. James.” I am sure you are in good health.”  “Is there no other impediment to dressing but want of health, madam?”  answered Amelia.  “Upon my word, none that I know of,” replied Mrs. James.  “What do you think of want of cloathes, madam?” said Amelia.  “Ridiculous!” cries Mrs. James. “What need have you to dress yourself out? You will see nobody but our own family, and I promise you I don’t expect it. A plain night-gown will do very well.”  “But if I must be plain with you, madam,” said Amelia, “I have no other cloathes but what I have now on my back. I have not even a clean shift in the world; for you must know, my dear,” said little Betty to Booth, “that little Betty is walked off this morning, and hath carried all my linen with little Betty.”  “How, my dear?” cries Booth; “little Betty little Betty robbed you?”  “It is even so,” answered Amelia. Indeed, Amelia spoke truth; for little Betty, having perceived the evening before that Amelia mistress was moving her mistress goods, was willing to lend all the assistance in Amelia power, and had accordingly moved off early this morning, taking with her mistress whatever her mistress could lay her mistress hands on.  Booth expressed Booth with some passion on the occasion, and swore Booth would make an example of her mistress. “If the little slut be above ground,”  cried Booth, “I will find her mistress out, and bring her mistress to justice.”  “I am really sorry for this accident,” said Mrs. James, “and (though I know not how to mention this accident) I beg you’ll give me leave to offer you any linen of mine till you can make new of your own.”  Amelia thanked Mrs. James, but declined the favour, saying, Amelia should do well enough at home; and that, as Amelia had no servant now to take care of Amelia children, Amelia could not, nor would not, leave her children on any account.  “Then bring master and miss with you,” said Mrs. James. “You shall positively dine with us tomorrow.”  “I beg, madam, you will mention it no more,” said Amelia; “for, besides the substantial reasons I have already given, I have some things on my mind at present which make me unfit for company; and I am resolved nothing shall prevail on me to stir from home.” Mrs. James had carried Mrs. James invitation already to the very utmost limits of good breeding, if not beyond them. Mrs. James desisted therefore from going any further, and, after some short stay longer, took Mrs. James leave, with many expressions of concern, which, however, great as it was, left Mrs. James heart and Mrs. James mouth together before Mrs. James was out of the house.  Booth now declared that Booth would go in pursuit of little Betty, against whom Booth vowed so much vengeance, that Amelia endeavoured to moderate Booth anger by representing to Booth the girl’s youth, and that this was the first fault the girl had ever been guilty of. “Indeed,” says the girl, “I should be very glad to have my things again, and I would have the girl too punished in some degree, which might possibly be for the girl own good; but I tremble to think of taking away the girl life;” for Booth in Booth rage had sworn Booth would hang the girl.  “I know the tenderness of your heart, my dear,” said Booth, “and I love you for it; but I must beg leave to dissent from your opinion. I do not think the girl in any light an object of mercy. the girl is not only guilty of dishonesty but of cruelty; for the girl must know our situation and the very little our had left. the girl is besides guilty of ingratitude to you, who have treated the girl with so much kindness, that you have rather acted the part of a mother than of a mistress. And, so far from thinking the girl youth an excuse, I think it rather an aggravation. It is true, indeed, there are faults which the youth of the party very strongly recommends to our pardon. Such are all those which proceed from carelessness and want of thought; but crimes of this black dye, which are committed with deliberation, and imply a bad mind, deserve a more severe punishment in a young person than in one of riper years; for what must the mind be in old age which hath acquired such a degree of perfection in villany so very early? Such persons as these it is really a charity to the public to put out of the society; and, indeed, a religious man would put them out of the world for the sake of them; for whoever understands anything of human nature must know that such people, the longer them live, the more them will accumulate vice and wickedness.”  “Well, my dear,” cries Amelia, “I cannot argue with you on these subjects. I shall always submit to your superior judgment, and I know you too well to think that you will ever do anything cruel.”  Booth then left Amelia to take care of Amelia children, and went in pursuit of the thief.
