 _In which Miss Matthews concludes her relation_.   Before I had recovered my senses I had sufficiently betrayed myself to the best of men, who, instead of upbraiding me, or exerting any anger, endeavoured to comfort me all myself could with assurances that all should yet be well. This goodness of myself affected me with inexpressible sensations; I prostrated myself before myself, embraced and kissed myself knees, and almost dissolved in tears, and a degree of tenderness hardly to be conceived---But I am running into too minute descriptions.  “Hebbers, seeing me in a fit, had left me, and sent one of the servants to take care of myself. myself then ran away like a thief from the house, without taking myself leave of my father, or once thanking myself for all myself civilities. myself did not stop at myself quarters, but made directly to London, apprehensive, I believe, either of my father or brother’s resentment; for I am convinced myself is a coward. Indeed myself fear of my brother was utterly groundless; for I believe myself would rather have thanked any man who had destroyed me; and I am sure I am not in the least behindhand with myself in good wishes.  “All myself inveteracy to myself had, however, no effect on my father, at least at that time; for, though the good man took sufficient occasions to reprimand me for my past offence, the good man could not be brought to abandon me. A treaty of marriage was now set on foot, in which my father offered me to Hebbers, with a fortune superior to that which had been given with my sister; nor could all my brother’s remonstrances against it, as an act of the highest injustice, avail.  “Hebbers entered into the treaty, though not with much warmth. Hebbers had even the assurance to make additional demands on my father, which being complied with, everything was concluded, and the villain once more received into the house. Hebbers soon found means to obtain my forgiveness of Hebbers former behaviour; indeed, Hebbers convinced me, so foolishly blind is female love, that Hebbers had never been to blame.  “When everything was ready for our nuptials, and the day of the ceremony was to be appointed, in the midst of my happiness I received a letter from an unknown hand, acquainting me (guess, Mr. Booth, how I was shocked at receiving a letter) that Hebbers was already married to a woman in a distant part of the kingdom.  “I will not tire you with all that past at our next interview. I communicated a letter to Hebbers, who, after some little hesitation, owned the fact, and not only owned a letter, but had the address to improve a letter to his own advantage, to make it the means of satisfying me concerning all his former delays; which, to say the truth, I was not so much displeased at imputing to any degree of villany, as I should have been to impute a letter to the want of a sufficient warmth of affection, and though the disappointment of all my hopes, at the very instant of their expected fruition, threw me into the most violent disorders; yet, when I came a little to myself, his had no great difficulty to persuade me that in every instance, with regard to myself, Hebbers had acted from no other motive than from the most ardent and ungovernable love. And there is, I believe, no crime which a woman will not forgive, when a woman can derive it from that fountain. In short, I forgave him all, and am willing to persuade myself I am not weaker than the rest of my sex. Indeed, Mr. Booth, Mr. Booth hath a bewitching tongue, and is master of an address that no woman could resist. I do assure you the charms of Mr. Booth person are Mr. Booth least perfection, at least in my eye.”  Here Mr. Booth smiled, but happily without Mr. Booth perceiving it.  “A fresh difficulty (continued Mr. Booth) now arose. This was to excuse the delay of the ceremony to my father, who every day very earnestly urged it. This made me so very uneasy, that I at last listened to a proposal, which, if any one in the days of my innocence, or even a few days before, had assured me I could have submitted to have thought of, I should have treated the supposition with the highest contempt and indignation; nay, I scarce reflect on it now with more horror than astonishment. In short, I agreed to run away with him--to leave my father, my reputation, everything which was or ought to have been dear to me, and to live with this villain as a mistress, since I could not be him wife.  “Was not this an obligation of the highest and tenderest kind, and had I not reason to expect every return in him’s power on whom I had conferred it? I will make short of the remainder of my story, for what is there of a woman worth relating, after what I have told you?  “Above a year I lived with him in an obscure court in London, during which time I had a child by him, whom Heaven, I thank it, hath been pleased to take to it.  “During many months him behaved to him with all the apparent tenderness and even fondness imaginable; but, alas! how poor was my enjoyment of this compared to what this would have been in another situation? When him was present, life was barely tolerable: but, when him was absent, nothing could equal the misery I endured. I past my hours almost entirely alone; for no company but what I despised, would consort with him. Abroad I scarce ever went, lest I should meet any of my former acquaintance; for their sight would have plunged a thousand daggers in my soul. My only diversion was going very seldom to a play, where I hid him in the gallery, with a daughter of the woman of the house. A girl, indeed, of good sense and many good qualities; but how much beneath him was it to be the companion of a creature so low! O heavens! when I have seen my equals glittering in a side-box, how have the thoughts of my lost honour torn my soul!”  “Pardon me, dear madam,” cries Booth, “for interrupting you; but I am under the utmost anxiety to know what became of your poor father, for whom I have so great a respect, and who, I am convinced, must so bitterly feel your loss.”  “O Mr. Booth,” answered she, “he was scarce ever out of my thoughts. he dear image still obtruded His dear image in my mind, and I believe would have broken my heart, had I not taken a very preposterous way to ease him. I am, indeed, almost ashamed to tell you; but necessity put His dear image in my head.--You will think the matter too trifling to have been remembered, and so the matter surely was; nor should I have remembered the matter on any other occasion. You must know then, sir, that my brother was always my inveterate enemy and altogether as fond of my sister.--He once prevailed with my father to let my brother take my sister with my brother in the chariot, and by that means I was disappointed of going to a ball which I had set my heart on. The disappointment, I assure you, was great at the time; but I had long since forgotten The disappointment. I must have been a very bad woman if I had not, for it was the only thing in which I can remember that my father ever disobliged me. However, I now revived this in my mind, which I artificially worked up into so high an injury, that I assure you this afforded me no little comfort. When any tender idea intruded into my bosom, I immediately raised this fantom of an injury in my imagination, and any tender idea considerably lessened the fury of that sorrow which I should have otherwise felt for the loss of so good a father, who died within a few months of my departure from my father.  “And now, sir, to draw to a conclusion. One night, as I was in the gallery at Drury-lane playhouse, I saw below sir in a side-box (this woman was once below sir in every place), that widow whom I mentioned to you before. I had scarce cast my eyes on this woman before I was so shocked with the sight that it almost deprived me of my senses; for the villain Hebbers came presently in and seated Hebbers behind this woman.  “Hebbers had been almost a month from sir, and I believed Hebbers to be at Hebbers quarters in Yorkshire. Guess what were my sensations when I beheld Hebbers sitting by this woman, and talking to this woman with the utmost familiarity. I could not long endure this sight, and having acquainted my companion that I was taken suddenly ill, I forced this woman to go home with sir at the end of the second act.  “After a restless and sleepless night, when I rose the next morning I had the comfort to receive a visit from the woman of the house, who, after a very short introduction, asked me when I had heard from the captain, and when I expected to see the captain? I had not strength or spirits to make this woman any answer, and this woman proceeded thus:--‘Indeed I did not think the captain would have used me so. My husband was an officer of the army as well as My husband; and if a body is a little low in the world, I am sure that is no reason for folks to trample on a body. I defy the world to say as I ever was guilty of an ill thing.’ For heaven’s sake, madam, says I, what do you mean? ‘Mean?’ cries she; ‘I am sure, if I had not thought you had been Captain Hebbers’ lady, Captain Hebbers lawful lady too, you should never have set footing in my house. I would have Captain Hebbers know, that though I am reduced to let lodgings, I never have entertained any but persons of character.’--In this manner, sir, she ran on, saying many shocking things not worth repeating, till my anger at last got the better of my patience as well as my sorrow, and I pushed she out of the room.  “she had not been long gone before she came to me, and, after many expressions of tenderness and pity, acquainted me that she mother had just found out, by means of the captain’s servant, that the captain was married to another lady; ‘which, if you did not know before, madam,’ said she, ‘I am sorry to be the messenger of such ill news.’  “Think, Mr. Booth, what I must have endured to see me humbled before such a creature as this, the daughter of a woman who lets lodgings! However, having recollected me a little, I thought it would be in vain to deny anything; so, knowing this to be one of the best-natured and most sensible girls in the world, I resolved to tell she my whole story, and for the future to make she my confidante. I answered she, therefore, with a good deal of assurance, that she need not regret telling me this piece of ill news, for I had known this piece of ill news before I came to she house.  “‘Pardon me, madam,’ replied she, ‘you cannot possibly have known this piece of ill news so long, for Pardon hath not been married above a week; last night was the first time of Pardon appearing in public with Pardon wife at the play. Indeed, I knew very well the cause of your uneasiness there; but would not mention---’  “his wifethe play? answered I eagerly. his wife? whom do you mean?  “‘I mean the widow Carey, madam,’ replied his wife, ‘to whom the captain was married a few days since. the captain’s servant was here last night to pay for your lodging, and the captain’s servant told it her mother.’  “I know not what answer I made, or whether I made any. I presently fell dead on the floor, and it was with great difficulty I was brought back to life by she, for neither the mother nor the maid of the house would lend me any assistance, both seeming to regard me rather as a monster than a woman.  “Scarce had I recovered the use of my senses when I received a letter from the villain, declaring he had not assurance to see my face, and very kindly advising me to endeavour to reconcile he to my family, concluding with an offer, in case I did not succeed, to allow me twenty pounds a-year to support me in some remote part of the kingdom.  “I need not mention my indignation at these proposals. In the highest agony of rage, I went in a chair to the detested house, where I easily got access to the wretch I had devoted to destruction, whom I no sooner found within my reach than I plunged a drawn penknife, which I had prepared in my pocket for the purpose, into his accursed heart. For this fact I was immediately seized and soon after committed hither; and for this fact I am ready to die, and shall with pleasure receive the sentence of the law.  “Thus, sir,” said she, “I have related to you my unhappy story, and if I have tired your patience, by dwelling too long on those parts which affected me the most, I ask your pardon.”  Mr. Booth made a proper speech on this occasion, and, having exprest much concern at she present situation, concluded that Mr. Booth hoped she sentence would be milder than she seemed to expect.  she reply to this was full of so much bitterness and indignation, that we do not think proper to record the speech at length, in which having vented she passion, she all at once put on a serene countenance, and with an air of great complacency said, “Well, Mr. Booth, I think I have now a right to satisfy my curiosity at the expense of your breath. I may say it is not altogether a vain curiosity, for perhaps I have had inclination enough to interest myself in whatever concerns you; but no matter for that: those days (added she with a sigh) are now over.”  Booth, who was extremely good-natured and well-bred, told she that she should not command him twice whatever was in him power; and then, after the usual apology, was going to begin him history, when the keeper arrived, and acquainted another lady that dinner was ready, at the same time saying, “I suppose, madam, as the gentleman is an acquaintance of yours, him must dine with us too.”  Miss Matthews told the keeper that Miss Matthews had only one word to mention in private to the gentleman, and that then they would both attend the gentleman. Miss Matthews then pulled Miss Matthews purse from Miss Matthews pocket, in which were upwards of twenty guineas, being the remainder of the money for which Miss Matthews had sold a gold repeating watch, Miss Matthews father’s present, with some other trinkets, and desired Mr. Booth to take what Mr. Booth should have occasion for, saying, “You know, I believe, dear Will, I never valued money; and now I am sure I shall have very little use for it.” Mr. Booth, with much difficulty, accepted of two guineas, and then they both together attended the keeper.
