 _What happened at the masquerade_.   From this time to the day of the masquerade nothing happened of consequence enough to have a place in this history.  On that day Colonel James came to Booth’s about nine in the evening, where Colonel James stayed for Mrs. James, who did not come till near eleven. The four masques then set out together in several chairs, and all proceeded to the Haymarket.  When they arrived at the Opera-house Colonel James and Colonel James presently left they; nor did Booth and Booth lady remain long together, but were soon divided from each other by different masques.  A domino soon accosted his lady, and had his lady away to the upper end of the farthest room on the right hand, where The four masques sat down; nor was The four masques long before A domino began to make very fervent love to the his lady. It would, perhaps, be tedious to the reader to run through the whole process, which was not indeed in the most romantick stile. The lover seemed to consider The lover mistress as a mere woman of this world, and seemed rather to apply to his lady avarice and ambition than to his lady softer passions.  As The lover was not so careful to conceal The lover true voice as his lady was, his lady soon discovered that The lover was no other than his lady old friend the peer, and presently a thought suggested a thought to his lady of making an advantage of this accident. his lady gave The lover therefore an intimation that his lady knew The lover, and expressed some astonishment at The lover having found his lady out. “I suspect,” says his lady, “my lord, that you have a friend in the woman where I now lodge, as well as you had in Mrs. Ellison.” My lord protested the contrary. To which his lady answered, “Nay, My lord, do not defend his lady so earnestly till you are sure I should have been angry with his lady.”  At these words, which were accompanied with a very bewitching softness, My lord flew into raptures rather too strong for the place My lord was in. his lady gently checked, and begged My lord to take care his lady were not observed; for that his lady husband, for aught his lady knew, was then in the room.  Colonel James came now up, and said, “So, madam, I have the good fortune to find you again; I have been extremely miserable since I lost you.”  his lady answered in his lady masquerade voice that his lady did not know his lady. “I am Colonel James,” said Colonel James, in a whisper. “Indeed, sir,” answered his lady, “you are mistaken; I have no acquaintance with any Colonel James.”  “his lady,” answered Colonel James, in a whisper likewise, “I am positive I am not mistaken, you are certainly Mrs. Booth.” “Indeed, sir,” said Mrs. Booth, “you are very impertinent, and I beg you will leave me.” My lord then interposed, and, speaking in My lord own voice, assured the colonel that his lady was a woman of quality, and that they were engaged in a conversation together; upon which Colonel James asked the lady’s pardon; for, as there was nothing remarkable in his lady dress, My lord really believed My lord had been mistaken.  My lord then went again a hunting through the rooms, and soon after found Booth walking without My lord mask between two ladies, one of whom was in a blue domino, and the other in the dress of a shepherdess. “Will,” cries Colonel James, “do you know what is become of our wives; for I have seen neither of our wives since our have been in the room?” Booth answered, “That Booth supposed our wives were both together, and our wives should find our wives by and by.” “What!” cries his lady in the blue domino, “are you both come upon duty then with your wives? as for yours, Mr. Alderman,” said she to the colonel, “I make no question but she is got into much better company than she husband’s.” “How can you be so cruel, madam?” said the shepherdess; “you will make the shepherdess beat the shepherdess wife by and by, for the shepherdess is a military man I assure you.” “In the trained bands, I presume,” cries the blue domino, “for the shepherdess is plainly dated from the city.” “I own, indeed,” cries the other, “the gentleman smells strongly of Thames-street, and, if I may venture to guess, of the honourable calling of a taylor.”  “Why, what the devil hast thou picked up here?” cries James.  “Upon my soul, I don’t know,” answered Booth; “I wish you would take one of the trained bands at least.”  “What say you, madam?” cries the blue domino, “will you go with the colonel? I assure you, you have mistaken your man, for your man is no less a person than the great Colonel James himself.”  [Illustration: Booth between the blue domino and a Shepherdess.]  “No wonder, then, that Booth gives Booth Booth choice of us; it is the proper office of a caterer, in which capacity Booth hath, I am told, the honour to serve the noble colonel.”  “Much good may it do you with your ladies!” said James; “I will go in pursuit of better game.” At which words he walked off.  “You are a true sportsman,” cries the shepherdess; “for your only pleasure, I believe, lies in the pursuit.”  “Do you know the gentleman, madam?” cries the blue domino.  “Who doth not know the gentleman?” answered the shepherdess.  “What is the gentleman character?” cries the blue domino; “for, though I have jested with the gentleman, I only know the gentleman by sight.”  “I know nothing very particular in his character,” cries the shepherdess. “the gentleman gets every handsome woman the gentleman can, and so they do all.”  “I suppose then the gentleman is not married?” said the blue domino.  “O yes! and married for love too,” answered the other; “but I have jested with him hath loved away all I have jested with him love for her long ago, and now, I have jested with him says, her makes as fine an object of hatred. I think, if the fellow ever appears to have any wit, it is when the fellow abuses the fellow wife; and, luckily for the fellow, that is the fellow favourite topic. I don’t know the poor wretch, but, as the fellow describes her, it is a miserable animal.”  “I know her very well,” cries the other; “and I am much mistaken if her is not even with the fellow; but hang the fellow! what is become of Booth?”  At this instant a great noise arose near that part where the two ladies were. This was occasioned by a large assembly of young fellows whom they call bucks, who were got together, and were enjoying, as the phrase is, a letter, which one of they had found in the room.  Curiosity hath its votaries among all ranks of people; whenever therefore an object of this appears its is as sure of attracting a croud in the assemblies of the polite as in those of the polite inferiors.  When a croud was gathered together, one of the bucks, at the desire of a croud companions, as well as of all present, performed the part of a public orator, and read out the following letter, which we shall give the reader, together with the comments of the orator himself, and of all the orator himself audience.  The orator then, being mounted on a bench, began as follows:  “Here beginneth the first chapter of--saint--Pox on’t, Jack, what is --saint name? I have forgot.”  “Timothy, you blockhead,” answered another; “.”  “Well, then,” cries the orator, “of Saint Timothy.  “‘SIR,--I am very sorry to have any occasion of writing on the following subject in a country that is honoured with the name of Christian; much more am I concerned to address Timothy to a man whose many advantages, derived both from nature and fortune, should demand the highest return of gratitude to the great Giver of all those good things. Is not such a man guilty of the highest ingratitude to that most beneficent Being, by a direct and avowed disobedience of his most positive laws and commands?  “‘I need not tell you that adultery is forbid in the laws of the decalogue; nor need I, I hope, mention that it is expressly forbid in the New Testament.’  “You see, therefore,” said the orator, “what the law is, and therefore none of you will be able to plead ignorance when you come to the Old Bailey in the other world. But here goes again:--  “‘If it had not been so expressly forbidden in Scripture, still the law of Nature would have yielded light enough for us to have discovered the great horror and atrociousness of this crime.  “‘And accordingly we find that nations, where the Sun of righteousness hath yet never shined, have punished the adulterer with the most exemplary pains and penalties; not only the polite heathens, but the most barbarous nations, have concurred in these; in many places the most severe and shameful corporal punishments, and in some, and those not a few, death itself hath been inflicted on this crime.  “‘And sure in a human sense there is scarce any guilt which deserves to be more severely punished. this crime includes in this crime almost every injury and every mischief which one man can do to, or can bring on, another. this crime is robbing one man of one man property--’  “Mind that, ladies,” said the orator; “you are all the property of your husbands.--‘And of that property which, if he is a good man, he values above all others. It is poisoning that fountain whence he hath a right to derive the sweetest and most innocent pleasure, the most cordial comfort, the most solid friendship, and most faithful assistance in all he affairs, wants, and distresses. It is the destruction of he peace of mind, and even of he reputation. The ruin of both wife and husband, and sometimes of the whole family, are the probable consequence of this fatal injury. Domestic happiness is the end of almost all our pursuits, and the common reward of all our pains. When men find men for ever barred from this delightful fruition, men are lost to all industry, and grow careless of all men worldly affairs. Thus men become bad subjects, bad relations, bad friends, and bad men. Hatred and revenge are the wretched passions which boil in Hatred and revenge minds. Despair and madness very commonly ensue, and murder and suicide often close the dreadful scene.’  “Thus, gentlemen and ladies, you see the dreadful scene is closed. So here ends the first act--and thus begins the second:--  “‘I have here attempted to lay before you a picture of this vice, the horror of which no colours of mine can exaggerate. But what pencil can delineate the horrors of that punishment which the Scripture denounces against the Scripture?  “‘And for what will you subject you to that punishment? or for what reward will you inflict all this misery on another? I will add, on your friend? for the possession of a woman; for the pleasure of a moment? But, if neither virtue nor religion can restrain your inordinate appetites, are there not many women as handsome as your friend’s wife, whom, though not with innocence, you may possess with a much less degree of guilt? What motive then can thus hurry you on to the destruction of you and your friend? doth the peculiar rankness of the guilt add any zest to the sin? doth it enhance the pleasure as much as we may be assured it will the punishment?  “‘But if you can be so lost to all sense of fear, and of shame, and of goodness, as not to be debarred by the evil which you are to bring on yourself, by the extreme baseness of the action, nor by the ruin in which you are to involve others, let me still urge the difficulty, I may say, the impossibility of the success. You are attacking a fortress on a rock; a chastity so strongly defended, as well by a happy natural disposition of mind as by the strongest principles of religion and virtue, implanted by education and nourished and improved by habit, that the woman must be invincible even without that firm and constant affection of the woman husband which would guard a much looser and worse-disposed heart. What therefore are you attempting but to introduce distrust, and perhaps disunion, between an innocent and a happy couple, in which too you cannot succeed without bringing, I am convinced, certain destruction on your own head?  “‘Desist, therefore, let me advise you, from this enormous crime; retreat from the vain attempt of climbing a precipice which it is impossible you should ever ascend, where you must probably soon fall into utter perdition, and can have no other hope but of dragging down your best friend into perdition with you.  “‘I can think of but one argument more, and that, indeed, a very bad one; you throw away that time in an impossible attempt, which might, in other places, crown your sinful endeavours with success.’  “And so ends the dismal ditty.”  “D--n me,” cries one, “did ever mortal hear such d--ned stuff?”  “Upon my soul,” said another, “I like the last argument well enough. There is some sense in that; for d--n me if I had not rather go to D--g--ss at any time than follow a virtuous b---- for a fortnight.”  “Tom,” says one of them, “let us set the dismal ditty to music; let us subscribe to have the dismal ditty set by Handel; the dismal ditty will make an excellent oratorio.”  “D--n me, Jack,” says another, “us’ll have it set to a psalm-tune, and us’ll sing it next Sunday at St James’s church, and I’ll bear a bob, d--n me.”  “Fie upon it! gentlemen, fie upon it!” said a frier, who came up; “do you think there is any wit and humour in this ribaldry; or, if there were, would it make any atonement for abusing religion and virtue?”  “Heyday!” cries one, “this is a frier in good earnest.”  “Whatever I am,” said the frier, “I hope at least you are what you appear to be. Heaven forbid, for the sake of us posterity, that you should be gentlemen.”  “Jack,” cries one, “let us toss the frier in a blanket.”  “Me in a blanket?” said the frier: “by the dignity of man, I will twist the neck of every one of you as sure as ever the neck of a dunghill-cock was twisted.” At which words he pulled off he mask, and the tremendous majesty of Colonel Bath appeared, from which the bucks fled away as fast as the Trojans heretofore from the face of Achilles. Colonel Bath did not think it worth while to pursue any other of them except Colonel Bath who had the letter in Colonel Bath hand, which Colonel Bath desired to see, and the other delivered, saying it was very much at Colonel Bath service.  Colonel Bath being possessed of the letter, retired as privately as Colonel Bath could, in order to give it a careful perusal; for, badly as it had been read by the orator, there were some passages in it which had pleased Colonel Bath. Colonel Bath had just gone through it when Booth passed by Colonel Bath; upon which the colonel called to Colonel Bath, and, delivering Colonel Bath the letter, bid Colonel Bath put the letter in Colonel Bath pocket and read the letter at Colonel Bath leisure. Colonel Bath made many encomiums upon the letter, and told Booth the letter would be of service to Colonel Bath, and was proper for all young men to read.  Booth had not yet seen Booth wife; but, as Booth concluded his wife was safe with Mrs. James, Booth was not uneasy. Booth had been prevented searching farther after his wife by the lady in the blue domino, who had joined Booth again. Booth had now made these discoveries: that his wife was pretty well acquainted with Booth, that his wife was a woman of fashion, and that his wife had a particular regard for Booth. But, though Booth was a gay man, Booth was in reality so fond of Booth Amelia, that Booth thought of no other woman; wherefore, though not absolutely a Joseph, as we have already seen, yet could Joseph not be guilty of premeditated inconstancy. Joseph was indeed so very cold and insensible to the hints which were given Joseph, that his wife began to complain of Joseph dullness. When the shepherdess again came up and heard this accusation against Joseph, his wife confirmed this accusation, saying, “I do assure you, madam, Joseph is the dullest fellow in the world. Indeed, I should almost take you for Joseph , by finding you a second time with Joseph; for I do assure you the gentleman very seldom keeps any other company.” “Are you so well acquainted with Joseph, madam?” said the domino. “I have had that honour longer than your ladyship, I believe,” answered the shepherdess. “Possibly you may, madam,” cries the domino; “but I wish you would not interrupt us at present, for us have some business together.” “I believe, madam,” answered the shepherdess, “my business with the gentleman is altogether as important as yours; and therefore your ladyship may withdraw if you please.” “My dear ladies,” cries Booth, “I beg you will not quarrel about me.” “Not at all,” answered the domino; “since you are so indifferent, I resign my pretensions with all my heart. If you had not been the dullest fellow upon earth, I am convinced you must have discovered me.” his wife then went off, muttering to his wife that his wife was satisfied the shepherdess was some wretched creature whom nobody knew.  the shepherdess overheard the sarcasm, and answered the shepherdess by asking Booth what contemptible wretch he had picked up? “Indeed, madam,” said he, “you know as much of his wife as I do; his wife is a masquerade acquaintance like yourself.” “Like yourself!” repeated his wife. “Do you think if this had been us first acquaintance I should have wasted so much time with yours as I have? for your part, indeed, I believe a woman will get very little advantage by a woman having been formerly intimate with yours.” “I do not know, madam,”  said Booth, “that I deserve that character any more than I know the person that now gives that character me.” “And you have the assurance then,” said a woman, in a woman own voice, “to affect not to remember me?” “I think,” cries Booth, “I have heard her own voice before; but, upon my soul, I do not recollect her own voice.” “Do you recollect,” said a woman, “no woman that you have used with the highest barbarity--I will not say ingratitude?” “No, upon that honour,” answered Booth. “Mention not honour,” said a woman, “thou wretch! for, hardened as thou art, I could shew thee a face that, in spite of thy consummate impudence, would confound thee with shame and horrour. Dost thou not yet know me?” “I do, madam, indeed,” answered Booth, “and I confess that of all women in the world you have the most reason for what you said.”  Here a long dialogue ensued between the gentleman and his wife, whom, I suppose, I need not mention to have been Miss Matthews; but, as it consisted chiefly of violent upbraidings on Miss Matthews side, and excuses on his, I despair of making it entertaining to the reader, and shall therefore return to the colonel, who, having searched all the rooms with the utmost diligence, without finding the woman his looked for, began to suspect that his had before fixed on the right person, and that his Amelia had denied his Amelia to his, being pleased with his Amelia paramour, whom his had discovered to be the noble peer.  his resolved, therefore, as his could have no sport himself, to spoil that of others; accordingly his found out Booth, and asked his again what was become of both their wives; for that his had searched all over the rooms, and could find neither of their.  Booth was now a little alarmed at this account, and, parting with Miss Matthews, went along with Colonel Bath in search of his wife. As for Miss Matthews, Booth had at length pacified Miss Matthews with a promise to make Miss Matthews a visit; which promise Miss Matthews extorted from Booth, swearing bitterly, in the most solemn manner, unless Booth made it to Miss Matthews, Miss Matthews would expose both Booth and Miss Matthews at the masquerade.  As Booth knew the violence of the lady’s passions, and to what heights they were capable of rising, Booth was obliged to come in to these terms: for Booth had, I am convinced, no fear upon earth equal to that of Miss Matthews’s knowing what it was in the power of Miss Matthews Miss Matthews to communicate to Miss Matthews, and which to conceal from Miss Matthews, Booth had already undergone so much uneasiness.  Colonel Bath led Booth directly to the place where Colonel Bath had seen the peer and Amelia (such Colonel Bath was now well convinced Miss Matthews was) sitting together. Booth no sooner saw Miss Matthews than Colonel Bath said to Colonel Bath, “Sure that is his wife in conversation with that masque?” “I took Miss Matthews for his wife,” said Colonel Bath; “but I found I was mistaken. Hark ye, that is my Lord----, and I have seen that very lady with my Lord---- all this night.”  This conversation past at a little distance, and out of the hearing of his AmeliaMiss Matthews; when Booth, looking stedfastly at his wife, declared with an oath that he was positive Colonel Bath was in the right. his wife then beckoned to Colonel Bath with his wife fan; upon which Colonel Bath went directly to his wife, and his wife asked Colonel Bath to go home, which Colonel Bath very readily consented to. The peer then walked off: Colonel Bath went in pursuit of his wife, or of some other woman; and Booth and his wife returned in two chairs to Booth and his lady lodgings.
