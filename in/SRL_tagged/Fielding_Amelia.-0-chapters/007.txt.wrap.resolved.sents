 _Containing the extraordinary behaviour of Miss Matthews on Miss Matthews meeting with Booth, and some endeavours to prove, by reason and authority, that it is possible for a woman to appear to be what a woman really is not._   Eight or nine years had past since any interview between Mr. Booth and Miss Matthews; and Mr. Booth and Miss Matthews meeting now in so extraordinary a place affected both of Mr. Booth and Miss Matthews with an equal surprize.
After some immaterial ceremonies, the lady acquainted Booth that, having heard there was a person in the prison who knew the lady by the name of Miss Matthews, the lady had great curiosity to inquire who Booth was, whereupon Booth had been shewn to the lady from the window of the house; that the lady immediately recollected Booth, and, being informed of Booth distressful situation, for which the lady expressed great concern, the lady had sent Booth that guinea which Booth had received the day before; and then proceeded to excuse the lady for not having desired to see Booth at that time, when the lady was under the greatest disorder and hurry of spirits.
Booth made many handsome acknowledgments of the lady favour; and added that Booth very little wondered at the disorder of the lady spirits, concluding that Booth was heartily concerned at seeing the lady there; “but I hope, madam,” said he--  Here Booth hesitated; upon which, bursting into an agony of tears, the lady cried out, “O captain!
captain!
many extraordinary things have passed since last I saw you.
O gracious heaven!
did I ever expect that this would be the next place of our meeting?”  the lady then flung the lady into the lady chair, where the lady gave a loose to the lady passion, whilst he, in the most affectionate and tender manner, endeavoured to soothe and comfort the lady; but passion itself did probably more for passion itself own relief than all he friendly consolations.
Having vented this in a large flood of tears, the lady became pretty well composed; but Booth unhappily mentioning the lady father, the lady again relapsed into an agony, and cried out, “Why?
why will you repeat the name of that dear man?
I have disgraced that dear man, Booth, I am unworthy the name of that dear man daughter.”--Here passion again stopped the lady words, and discharged her words in tears.
After this second vent of sorrow or shame, or, if the reader pleases, of rage, the lady once more recovered from the lady agonies.
To say the truth, these are, I believe, as critical discharges of nature as any of those which are so called by the physicians, and do more effectually relieve the mind than any remedies with which the whole materia medica of philosophy can supply the whole materia medica of philosophy.
When Mrs. Vincent had recovered Mrs. Vincent faculties, Mrs. Vincent perceived Booth standing silent, with a mixture of concern and astonishment in Booth countenance; then addressing Mrs. Vincent to Booth with an air of most bewitching softness, of which Mrs. Vincent was a perfect mistress, Mrs. Vincent said, “I do not wonder at your amazement, Captain Booth, nor indeed at the concern which you so plainly discover for Mrs. Vincent; for I well know the goodness of your nature: but, O, Booth!
believe me, when you know what hath happened since our last meeting, the concern which you so plainly discover for me will be raised, however your astonishment may cease.
O, sir!
you are a stranger to the cause of my sorrows.”  “I hope I am, madam,” answered he; “for I cannot believe what I have heard in the prison--surely murder”--at which words Mrs. Vincent started from Mrs. Vincent chair, repeating, “Murder!
oh!
it is music in my ears!--You have heard then the cause of my commitment, my glory, my delight, my reparation!
Yes, my old friend, this is the hand, this is the arm that drove the penknife to the penknife heart.
Unkind fortune, that not one drop of Unkind fortune blood reached my hand.--Indeed, sir, I would never have washed his blood from it.--But, though I have not the happiness to see his blood on the hand, I have the glorious satisfaction of remembering I saw his blood run in rivers on the floor; I saw his blood forsake Unkind fortune cheeks, I saw Unkind fortune fall a martyr to my revenge.
And is the killing a villain to be called murder?
perhaps the law calls the law so.--Let the law call the law what the law will, or punish me as the law pleases.---Punish me!--no, no---that is not in the power of man--not of that monster man, Mr. Booth.
I am undone, am revenged, and have now no more business for life; let them take the law from Mr. Booth when them will.”  Our poor gentleman turned pale with horror at this speech, and the ejaculation of “Good heavens!
what do I hear?” burst spontaneously from his lips; nor can Our wonder at this, though his was the bravest of men; for her voice, her looks, her gestures, were properly adapted to the sentiments her exprest.
Such indeed was her image, that neither could Shakspear describe, nor Hogarth paint, nor Clive act, a fury in higher perfection.
[Illustration: her then gave a loose to her passions]  “What do you hear?” reiterated her.
“You hear the resentment of the most injured of women.
You have heard, you say, of the murder; but do you know the cause, Mr. Booth?
Have you since your return to England visited that country where we formerly knew one another?
tell me, do you know my wretched story?
tell me that, my friend.”  Mr. Booth hesitated for an answer; indeed, Mr. Booth had heard some imperfect stories, not much to her advantage.
her waited not till Mr. Booth had formed a speech; but cried, “Whatever you may have heard, you cannot be acquainted with all the strange accidents which have occasioned your seeing me in a place which at our last parting was so unlikely that I should ever have been found in; nor can you know the cause of all that I have uttered, and which, I am convinced, you never expected to have heard from my mouth.
If these circumstances raise your curiosity, I will satisfy these circumstances.”  Mr. Booth answered, that curiosity was too mean a word to express Mr. Booth ardent desire of knowing her story.
Upon which, with very little previous ceremony, her began to relate what is written in the following chapter.
But before our put an end to this it may be necessary to whisper a word or two to the critics, who have, perhaps, begun to express no less astonishment than Mr. Booth, that a lady in whom our had remarked a most extraordinary power of displaying softness should, the very next moment after the words were out of my mouth, express sentiments becoming the lips of a Dalila, Jezebel, Medea, Semiramis, Parysatis, Tanaquil, Livilla, Messalina, Agrippina, Brunichilde, Elfrida, Lady Macbeth, Joan of Naples, Christina of Sweden, Katharine Hays, Sarah Malcolm, Con Philips,[Footnote: Though last not least.]
or any other heroine of the tender sex, which history, sacred or profane, ancient or modern, false or true, hath recorded.
We desire such critics to remember that it is the same English climate, in which, on the lovely 10th of June, under a serene sky, the amorous Jacobite, kissing the odoriferous zephyr’s breath, gathers a nosegay of white roses to deck the whiter breast of Celia; and in which, on the 11th of June, the very next day, the boisterous Boreas, roused by the hollow thunder, rushes horrible through the air, and, driving the wet tempest before him, levels the hope of the husbandman with the earth, dreadful remembrance of the consequences of the Revolution.
Again, let it be remembered that this is the selfsame Celia, all tender, soft, and delicate, who with a voice, the sweetness of which the Syrens might envy, warbles the harmonious song in praise of the young adventurer; and again, the next day, or, perhaps the next hour, with fiery eyes, wrinkled brows, and foaming lips, roars forth treason and nonsense in a political argument with some fair one of a different principle.
Or, if the critic be a Whig, and consequently dislikes such kind of similes, as being too favourable to Jacobitism, let the critic be contented with the following story:  I happened in my youth to sit behind two ladies in a side-box at a play, where, in the balcony on the opposite side, was placed the inimitable B---y C---s, in company with a young fellow of no very formal, or indeed sober, appearance.
One of two ladies, I remember, said to the other--“Did you ever see anything look so modest and so innocent as that girl over the way?
what pity it is such a creature should be in the way of ruin, as I am afraid that girl is, by that girl being alone with that young fellow!” Now the lady was no bad physiognomist, for it was impossible to conceive a greater appearance of modesty, innocence, and simplicity, than what nature had displayed in the countenance of that girl; and yet, all appearances notwithstanding, I myself (remember, critic, it was in my youth) had a few mornings before seen that very identical picture of all those engaging qualities in bed with a rake at a bagnio, smoaking tobacco, drinking punch, talking obscenity, and swearing and cursing with all the impudence and impiety of the lowest and most abandoned trull of a soldier.
