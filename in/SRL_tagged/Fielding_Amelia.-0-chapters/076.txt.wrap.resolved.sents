 _Worthy a very serious perusal._   The colonel found Amelia sitting very disconsolate with Mrs. Atkinson.
The colonel entered the room with an air of great gaiety, assured Amelia that Amelia husband was perfectly well, and that her husband hoped the next day her husband would again be with Amelia.
Amelia was a little comforted at this account, and vented many grateful expressions to the colonel for her husband unparalleled friendship, as Amelia was pleased to call it.
Amelia could not, however, help giving way soon after to a sigh at the thoughts of her husband bondage, and declared that night would be the longest Amelia had ever known.
“This lady, madam,” cries The colonel, “must endeavour to make it shorter.
And, if you will give me leave, I will join in the same endeavour.” Then, after some more consolatory speeches, the colonel attempted to give a gay turn to the discourse, and said, “I was engaged to have spent this evening disagreeably at Ranelagh, with a set of company I did not like.
How vastly am I obliged to you, dear Mrs. Booth, that I pass it so infinitely more to my satisfaction!”  “Indeed, colonel,” said Amelia, “I am convinced that to a mind so rightly turned as you there must be a much sweeter relish in the highest offices of friendship than in any pleasures which the gayest public places can afford.”  “Upon my word, madam,” said The colonel, “you now do me more than justice.
I have, and always had, the utmost indifference for such pleasures.
Indeed, I hardly allow them worthy of that name, or, if them are so at all, it is in a very low degree.
In my opinion the highest friendship must always lead us to the highest pleasure.”  Here Amelia entered into a long dissertation on friendship, in which she pointed several times directly at the colonel as the hero of she tale.
The colonel highly applauded all she sentiments; and when The colonel could not avoid taking the compliment to The colonel, The colonel received the compliment with a most respectful bow.
The colonel then tried The colonel hand likewise at description, in which The colonel found means to repay all Amelia’s panegyric in kind.
This, though The colonel did with all possible delicacy, yet a curious observer might have been apt to suspect that it was chiefly on she account that The colonel had avoided the masquerade.
In discourses of this kind they passed the evening, till it was very late, The colonel never offering to stir from The colonel chair before the clock had struck one; when The colonel thought, perhaps, that decency obliged The colonel to take The colonel leave.
As soon as The colonel was gone Mrs. Atkinson said to Mrs. Booth, “I think, madam, you told me this afternoon that The colonel was married?”  Amelia answered, Amelia did so.
“I think likewise, madam,” said Mrs. Atkinson, “you was acquainted with The colonel’s lady?”  Amelia answered that Amelia had been extremely intimate with Amelia abroad.
“Is Amelia young and handsome?” said Mrs. Atkinson.
“In short, pray, was it a match of love or convenience?”  Amelia answered, entirely of love, Amelia believed, on his side; for that ’s lady?”   had little or no fortune.
“I am very glad to hear it,” said Mrs. Atkinson; “for Mrs. Atkinson am sure The colonel is in love with somebody.
I think I never saw a more luscious picture of love drawn than that which The colonel was pleased to give us as the portraiture of friendship.
I have read, indeed, of Pylades and Orestes, Damon and Pythias, and other great friends of old; nay, I sometimes flatter Mrs. Atkinson that I am capable of being a friend myself; but as for that fine, soft, tender, delicate passion, which The colonel was pleased to describe, I am convinced there must go a The colonel and a she to the composition.”  “Upon my word, my dear, you are mistaken,” cries Amelia.
“If you had known the friendship which hath always subsisted between the colonel and my husband, you would not imagine it possible for any description to exceed it.
Nay, I think The colonel behaviour this very day is sufficient to convince you.”  “I own what The colonel hath done to-day hath great merit,” said Mrs. Atkinson; “and yet, from he hath said to-night--You will pardon me, dear madam; perhaps I am too quick-sighted in my observations; nay, I am afraid I am even impertinent.”  “Fie upon it!” cries Amelia; “how can you talk in that strain?
Do you imagine I expect ceremony?
Pray speak what you think with the utmost freedom.”  “Did The colonel not then,” said Mrs. Atkinson, “repeat the words, _the finest woman in the world_, more than once?
did The colonel not make use of an expression which might have become the mouth of Oroondates himself?
If I remember, the words were these--that, had The colonel been Alexander the Great, The colonel should have thought it more glory to have wiped off a tear from the bright eyes of Statira than to have conquered fifty worlds.”  “Did The colonel say so?” cries Amelia--“I think The colonel did say something like it; but my thoughts were so full of my husband that I took little notice.
But what would you infer from what The colonel said?
I hope you don’t think The colonel is in love with The colonel?”  “I hope The colonel doth not think so The colonel,” answered Mrs. Atkinson; “though, when The colonel mentioned the bright eyes of StatiraStatira, The colonel fixed The colonel own eyes on yours with the most languishing air I ever beheld.”  Amelia was going to answer, when the serjeant arrived, and then Amelia immediately fell to enquiring after Amelia , and received such satisfactory answers to all Amelia many questions concerning my husband, that Amelia expressed great pleasure.
These ideas so possessed Amelia mind, that, without once casting Amelia thoughts on any other matters, Amelia took Amelia leave of the serjeant and his lady, and repaired to bed to Amelia children, in a room which Mrs. Atkinson had provided Mrs. Atkinson in the same house; where we will at present wish Amelia a good night.
