 _Farther continued._   Mrs. Bennet, returning into the room, made a short apology for Mrs. Bennet absence, and then proceeded in these words:  “We now left We lodging, and took a second floor in that very house where you now are, to which We were recommended by the woman where We had before lodged, for the mistresses of both houses were acquainted; and, indeed, We had been all at the play together. To this new lodging then (such was We wretched destiny) We immediately repaired, and were received by Mrs. Ellison (how can I bear the sound of that detested name?) with much civility; Mrs. Ellison took care, however, during the first fortnight of We residence, to wait upon We every Monday morning for Mrs. Ellison rent; such being, it seems, the custom of this place, which, as it was inhabited chiefly by persons in debt, is not the region of credit.  “My husband, by the singular goodness of the rector, who greatly compassionated My husband case, was enabled to continue in My husband curacy, though My husband could only do the duty on Sundays. My husband was, however, sometimes obliged to furnish a person to officiate at My husband expence; so that our income was very scanty, and the poor little remainder of the legacy being almost spent, our were reduced to some difficulties, and, what was worse, saw still a prospect of greater before our eyes.  “Under these circumstances, how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet must have been the behaviour of Mrs. Ellison, who, when how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet carried how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet rent on the usual day, told how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet, with a benevolent smile, that how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet needed not to give how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet the trouble of such exact punctuality. how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet added that, if it was at any time inconvenient to how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet, how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet might pay how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet when how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet pleased. ‘To say the truth,’ says how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet, ‘I never was so much pleased with any lodgers in my life; I am convinced, how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet, you are a very worthy man, and you are a very happy one too; for you have the prettiest wife and the prettiest child I ever saw’ These, dear madam, were the words how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet was pleased to make use of: and I am sure how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet behaved to how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet with such an appearance of friendship and affection, that, as I could not perceive any possible views of interest which how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet could have in how agreeable to poor Mr. Bennet professions, I easily believed her professions real.  “There lodged in the same house--O, Mrs. Booth! the blood runs cold to my heart, and should run cold to yours, when I name him--there lodged in the same house-- a lord--the lord, indeed, whom I have since seen in your company. a lord--the lord, indeed, whom I have since seen in your company, Mrs. Ellison told me, had taken a great fancy to my little Charley. Fool that I was, and blinded by my own passion, which made me conceive that an infant, not three months old, could be really the object of affection to any besides a parent, and more especially to a gay young fellow! But, if I was silly in being deceived, how wicked was the wretch who deceived me--who used such art, and employed such pains, such incredible pains, to deceive me! He acted the part of a nurse to my little infant; He danced the part of a nurse, He lulled the part of a nurse, He kissed the part of a nurse; declared the part of a nurse was the very picture of a nephew of He--He favourite sister’s child; and said so many kind and fond things of the part of a nurse beauty, that I myself, though, I believe, one of the tenderest and fondest of mothers, scarce carried my own ideas of my little darling’s perfection beyond the compliments which He paid it.  “My lord, however, perhaps from modesty, before my face, fell far short of what Mrs. Ellison reported from Mrs. Ellison. And now, when Mrs. Ellison found the impression which was made on Mrs. Ellison by these means, Mrs. Ellison took every opportunity of insinuating to Mrs. Ellison his lordship’s many virtues, his great goodness to his sister’s children in particular; nor did Mrs. Ellison fail to drop some hints which gave me the most simple and groundless hopes of strange consequences from his fondness to my Charley.  “When, by these means, which, simple as they may appear, were, perhaps, the most artful, My lord had gained something more, I think, than my esteem, My lord took the surest method to confirm My lord in my affection. This was, by professing the highest friendship for my husband; for, as to Mrs. Ellison, I do assure you my husband never shewed me more than common respect; and I hope you will believe I should have immediately startled and flown off if my husband had. Poor I accounted for all the friendship which my husband expressed for my husband, and all the fondness which my husband shewed to my boy, from the great prettiness of the one and the great merit of the other; foolishly conceiving that others saw with my eyes and felt with my heart. Little did I dream that my own unfortunate person was the fountain of all this lord’s goodness, and was the intended price of it.  “One evening, as I was drinking tea with Mrs. Ellison by my lord’s fire (a liberty which Mrs. Ellison never scrupled taking when Mrs. Ellison was gone out), my little Charley, now about half a year old, sitting in Mrs. Ellison lap, my lord’s--accidentally, no doubt, indeed I then thought it so--came in. I was confounded, and offered to go; but my lord’s declared, if my lord’s disturbed Mrs. Ellison’s company, as my lord’s phrased it, my lord’s would my lord’s leave the room. When I was thus prevailed on to keep my seat, my lord’s immediately took my little baby into her lap, and gave her lap some tea there, not a little at the expense of my lord’s embroidery; for my lord’s was very richly drest; indeed, my lord’s was as fine a figure as perhaps ever was seen. my lord’s behaviour on this occasion gave me many ideas in my lord’s favour. I thought my lord’s discovered good sense, good nature, condescension, and other good qualities, by the fondness my lord’s shewed to my child, and the contempt my lord’s seemed to express for my lord’s finery, which so greatly became my lord’s; for I cannot deny but that my lord’s was the handsomest and genteelest person in the world, though such considerations advanced my lord’s not a step in my favour.  “My husband now returned from church (for this happened on a Sunday), and was, by my lord’s particular desire, ushered into the room. my lord’s received My husband with the utmost politeness, and with many professions of esteem, which, my lord’s said, my lord’s had conceived from Mrs. Ellison’s representations of my lord’s merit. my lord’s then proceeded to mention the living which was detained from my husband, of which Mrs. Ellison had likewise informed my lord’s; and said, my lord’s thought it would be no difficult matter to obtain a restoration of it by the authority of the bishop, who was my lord’s particular friend, and to whom my lord’s would take an immediate opportunity of mentioning it. This, at last, my lord’s determined to do the very next day, when my lord’s invited us both to dinner, where us were to be acquainted with my lord’s lordship’s success.  “my lord’s now insisted on my husband’s staying supper with my husband’s, without taking any notice of my lord’s; but Mrs. Ellison declared Mrs. Ellison should not part man and wife, and that Mrs. Ellison herself would stay with my lord’s. The motion was too agreeable to my lord’s to be rejected; and, except the little time I retired to put my child to bed, us spent together the most agreeable evening imaginable; nor was The motion, I believe, easy to decide whether Mr. Bennet or my lord’s were most delighted with his lordship and Mrs. Ellison; but this, I assure you, the generosity of the one, and the extreme civility and kindness of the other, were the subjects of us conversation all the ensuing night, during which us neither of us closed us eyes.  “The next day at dinner my lord acquainted us that my lord had prevailed with the bishop to write to the clergyman in the country; indeed, my lord told us that my lord had engaged the bishop to be very warm in us interest, and had not the least doubt of success. This threw us both into a flow of spirits; and in the afternoon Mr. Bennet, at Mrs. Ellison’s request, which was seconded by his lordship, related the history of us lives from us first acquaintance. my lord seemed much affected with some tender scenes, which, as no man could better feel, so none could better describe, than my husband. When my husband had finished, my lord begged pardon for mentioning an occurrence which gave my husband such a particular concern, as it had disturbed that delicious state of happiness in which us had lived at us former lodging. ‘It would be ungenerous,’ said he, ‘to rejoice at an accident which, though he, brought me fortunately acquainted with two of the most agreeable people in the world, was yet at the expense of your mutual felicity. The circumstance, I mean, is your debt at Oxford; pray, how doth that stand? I am resolved it shall never disturb your happiness hereafter.’ At these words the tears burst from my poor husband’s eyes; and, in an ecstasy of gratitude, he cried out, ‘Your lordship overcomes me with generosity. If you go on in this manner, both my wife’s gratitude and mine must be bankrupt’ he then acquainted my lord with the exact state of the case, and received assurances from he that the debt should never trouble he. my husband was again breaking out into the warmest expressions of gratitude, but my lord stopt my husband short, saying, ‘If you have any obligation, it is to my little Charley here, from whose little innocent smiles I have received more than the value of this trifling debt in pleasure.’ I forgot to tell you that, when I offered to leave the room after dinner upon my child’s account, my lord would not suffer me, but ordered my child’s to be brought to me. my lord now took my child’s account out of my arms, placed my child’s account upon my lord own knee, and fed my child’s account with some fruit from the dessert. In short, it would be more tedious to you than to me to relate the thousand little tendernesses my lord shewed to my child’s. my lord gave my child’s account many baubles; amongst the rest was a coral worth at least three pounds; and, when my husband was confined near a fortnight to my husband chamber with a cold, my husband visited my child’s every day (for to my little infant’s account were all the visits placed), and seldom failed of accompanying my husband visit with a present to the little thing.  “Here, Mrs. Booth, I cannot help mentioning a doubt which hath often arisen in my mind since I have been enough mistress of me to reflect on this horrid train which was laid to blow up my innocence. Wicked and barbarous it was to the highest degree without any question; but my doubt is, whether the art or folly of it be the more conspicuous; for, however delicate and refined the art or folly of it must be allowed to have been, the folly, I think, must upon a fair examination appear no less astonishing: for to lay all considerations of cruelty and crime out of the case, what a foolish bargain doth my husband make for my husband who purchases so poor a pleasure at so high a price!  “We had lived near three weeks with as much freedom as if We had been all of the same family, when, one afternoon, my lord proposed to my husband to ride down my lord to solicit the surrender; for my husband said the bishop had received an unsatisfactory answer from the parson, and had writ a second letter more pressing, which the parson now promised We to strengthen by one of his lordship own that my husband was to carry with my husband. his lordship agreed to this proposal with great thankfulness, and the next day was appointed for his lordship journey. The distance was near seventy miles.  “my husband set out on his journey, and my husband had scarce left me before Mrs. Ellison came into my room, and endeavoured to comfort me in my husband absence; to say the truth, though my husband was to be from me but a few days, and the purpose of my husband going was to fix our happiness on a sound foundation for all our future days, I could scarce support my spirits under this first separation. But though I then thought Mrs. Ellison’s intentions to be most kind and friendly, yet the means Mrs. Ellison used were utterly ineffectual, and appeared to me injudicious. Instead of soothing my uneasiness, which is always the first physic to be given to grief, Mrs. Ellison rallied me upon it, and began to talk in a very unusual stile of gaiety, in which Mrs. Ellison treated conjugal love with much ridicule.  “I gave Mrs. Ellison to understand that Mrs. Ellison displeased me by this discourse; but Mrs. Ellison soon found means to give such a turn to it as made a merit of all Mrs. Ellison had said. And now, when Mrs. Ellison had worked me into a good humour, Mrs. Ellison made a proposal to me which I at first rejected--but at last fatally, too fatally, suffered me to be over-persuaded. This was to go to a masquerade at Ranelagh, for which my lord had furnished Mrs. Ellison with tickets.”  At these words Amelia turned pale as death, and hastily begged Mrs. Ellison friend to give Mrs. Ellison a glass of water, some air, or anything. Mrs. Bennet, having thrown open the window, and procured the water, which prevented Amelia from fainting, looked at Mrs. Ellison with much tenderness, and cried, “I do not wonder, my dear madam, that you are affected with my mentioning that fatal masquerade; since I firmly believe the same ruin was intended for you at the same place; the apprehension of which occasioned the letter I sent you this morning, and all the trial of your patience which I have made since.”  Amelia gave Amelia a tender embrace, with many expressions of the warmest gratitude; assured Amelia Amelia had pretty well recovered Amelia spirits, and begged Amelia to continue Amelia story, which the afternoon Mr. Bennet then did. However, as our readers may likewise be glad to recover our readers spirits also, we shall here put an end to this chapter.
