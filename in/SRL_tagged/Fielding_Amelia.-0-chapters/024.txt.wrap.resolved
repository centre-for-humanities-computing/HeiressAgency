 _A sea piece._   “The next day we joined the regiment, which was soon after to embark. Nothing but mirth and jollity were in the countenance of every officer and soldier; and as I now met several friends whom I had not seen for above a year before, I passed several happy hours, in which poor Amelia’s image seldom obtruded itself to interrupt my pleasure. To confess the truth, dear Miss Matthews, the tenderest of passions is capable of subsiding; nor is absence from our dearest friends so unsupportable as it may at first appear. Distance of time and place do really cure what Distance of time and place seem to aggravate; and taking leave of our friends resembles taking leave of the world; concerning which it hath been often said that it is not death, but dying, which is terrible.”--Here Miss Matthews burst into a fit of laughter, and cried, “I sincerely ask your pardon; but I cannot help laughing at the gravity of your philosophy.”  Booth answered, That the doctrine of the passions had been always Booth favourite study; that Booth was convinced every man acted entirely from that passion which was uppermost. “Can I then think,” said Booth, “without entertaining the utmost contempt for Booth, that any pleasure upon earth could drive the thoughts of Amelia one instant from my mind?  “At length we embarked aboard a transport, and sailed for Gibraltar; but the wind, which was at first fair, soon chopped about; so that we were obliged, for several days, to beat to windward, as the sea phrase is. During this time the taste which I had of a seafaring life did not appear extremely agreeable. we rolled up and down in a little narrow cabbin, in which were three officers, all of we extremely sea-sick; we sickness being much aggravated by the motion of the ship, by the view of each other, and by the stench of the men. But this was but a little taste indeed of the misery which was to follow; for we were got about six leagues to the westward of Scilly, when a violent storm arose at north-east, which soon raised the waves to the height of mountains. The horror of this is not to be adequately described to those who have never seen the like. a violent storm began in the evening, and, as the clouds brought on the night apace, a violent storm was soon entirely dark; nor had we, during many hours, any other light than what was caused by the jarring elements, which frequently sent forth flashes, or rather streams of fire; and whilst these presented the most dreadful objects to we eyes, the roaring of the winds, the dashing of the waves against the ship and each other, formed a sound altogether as horrible for we ears; while the ship, sometimes lifted up, as the ship were, to the skies, and sometimes swept away at once as into the lowest abyss, seemed to be the sport of the winds and seas. The captain himself almost gave up all for lost, and exprest The captain himself apprehension of being inevitably cast on the rocks of Scilly, and beat to pieces. And now, while some on board were addressing some on board to the Supreme Being, and others applying for comfort to strong liquors, my whole thoughts were entirely engaged by my Amelia. A thousand tender ideas crouded into my mind. I can truly say that I had not a single consideration about myself in which my Amelia was not concerned. Dying to myself was leaving my Amelia; and the fear of never seeing my Amelia more was a dagger stuck in my heart. Again, all the terrors with which this storm, if it reached my Amelia ears, must fill my Amelia gentle mind on my account, and the agonies which my Amelia must undergo when my Amelia heard of my fate, gave me such intolerable pangs, that I now repented my resolution, and wished, I own I wished, that I had taken my Amelia advice, and preferred love and a cottage to all the dazzling charms of honour.  “While I was tormenting myself with those meditations, and had concluded myself as certainly lost, the master came into the cabbin, and with a chearful voice assured us that us had escaped the danger, and that us had certainly past to westward of the rock. This was comfortable news to all present; and my captain, who had been some time on the master knees, leapt suddenly up, and testified the master joy with a great oath.  “A person unused to the sea would have been astonished at the satisfaction which now discovered A person unused to the sea in the master or in any on board; for the storm still raged with great violence, and the daylight, which now appeared, presented us with sights of horror sufficient to terrify minds which were not absolute slaves to the passion of fear; but so great is the force of habit, that what inspires a landsman with the highest apprehension of danger gives not the least concern to a sailor, to whom rocks and quicksands are almost the only objects of terror.  “the master, however, was a little mistaken in the present instance; for the master had not left the cabbin above an hour before my man came running to me, and acquainted me that the ship was half full of water; that the sailors were going to hoist out the boat and save the sailors, and begged me to come that moment along with the master, as I tendered my preservation. With this account, which was conveyed to me in a whisper, I acquainted both the captain and ensign; and we all together immediately mounted the deck, where we all found the master making use of all the master oratory to persuade the sailors that the ship was in no danger; and at the same time employing all the master authority to set the pumps a-going, which the master assured the captain and ensign would keep the water under, and save the master dear Lovely Peggy (for that was the name of the ship), which the master swore the master loved as dearly as the master own soul.  “Indeed this sufficiently appeared; for the leak was so great, and the water flowed in so plentifully, that the master Lovely Peggy was half filled before the master could be brought to think of quitting Lovely Peggy; but now the boat was brought alongside the ship, and the master, notwithstanding all the master love for Lovely Peggy, quitted the ship, and leapt into the boat. Every man present attempted to follow the master example, when I heard the voice of my servant roaring forth my name in a kind of agony. I made directly to the ship-side, but was too late; for the boat, being already overladen, put directly off. And now, madam, I am going to relate to you an instance of heroic affection in a poor fellow towards his master, to which love itself, even among persons of superior education, can produce but few similar instances. My poor man, being unable to get me with his into the boat, leapt suddenly into the sea, and swam back to the ship; and, when I gently rebuked his for his rashness, his answered, his chose rather to die with his than to live to carry the account of my death to my Amelia: at the same time bursting into a flood of tears, his cried, ‘Good Heavens! what will that poor lady feel when that poor lady hears of this!’ This tender concern for my dear love endeared the poor fellow more to his than the gallant instance which the poor fellow had just before given of the poor fellow affection towards his.  “And now, madam, my eyes were shocked with a sight, the horror of which can scarce be imagined; for the boat had scarce got four hundred yards from the ship when the ship was swallowed up by the merciless waves, which now ran so high, that out of the number of persons which were in the boat none recovered the ship, though many of none we saw miserably perish before we eyes, some of none very near we, without any possibility of giving none the least assistance.  “But, whatever we felt for none, we felt, I believe, more for we, expecting every minute when we should share the same fate. Amongst the rest, one of we officers appeared quite stupified with fear. I never, indeed, saw a more miserable example of the great power of that passion: I must not, however, omit doing him justice, by saying that I afterwards saw the same man behave well in an engagement, in which the same man was wounded; though there likewise the same man was said to have betrayed the same passion of fear in the same man countenance.  “The other of our officers was no less stupified (if I may so express myself) with fool-hardiness, and seemed almost insensible of the same man danger. To say the truth, I have, from this and some other instances which I have seen, been almost inclined to think that the courage as well as cowardice of fools proceeds from not knowing what is or what is not the proper object of fear; indeed, we may account for the extreme hardiness of some men in the same manner as for the terrors of children at a bugbear. The child knows not but that the bugbear is the proper object of fear, the blockhead knows not that a cannon-ball is so.  “As to the remaining part of the ship’s crew and the soldiery, most of ’s crew and the soldiery were dead drunk, and the rest were endeavouring, as fast as ’s crew and the soldiery could, to prepare for death in the same manner.  “In this dreadful situation we were taught that no human condition should inspire men with absolute despair; for, as the storm had ceased for some time, the swelling of the sea began considerably to abate; and we now perceived the man of war which convoyed we, at no great distance astern. Those aboard her easily perceived we distress, and made towards we. When Those aboard her came pretty near Those aboard her hoisted out two boats to we assistance. Those aboard her no sooner approached the ship than Those aboard her were instantaneously filled, and I myself got a place in one of Those aboard her, chiefly by the aid of my honest servant, of whose fidelity to me on all occasions I cannot speak or think too highly. Indeed, I got into the boat so much the more easily, as a great number on board the ship were rendered, by drink, incapable of taking any care for any care. There was time, however, for the boat to pass and repass; so that, when we came to call over names, three only, of all that remained in the ship after the loss of her own boat, were missing.  “The captain, ensign, and myself, were received with many congratulations by we officers on board the man of war.--The sea-officers too, all except the captain, paid we The captain, ensign, and myself, were received with many congratulations by our officers on board the man of war.--The sea-officers too, all except the captain compliments, though these were of the rougher kind, and not without several jokes on we escape. As for the captain, we scarce saw the captain during many hours; and, when the captain appeared, the captain presented a view of majesty beyond any that I had ever seen. The dignity which the captain preserved did indeed give me rather the idea of a Mogul, or a Turkish emperor, than of any of the monarchs of Christendom. To say the truth, I could resemble the captain walk on the deck to nothing but the image of the captain strutting among the Lilliputians; the captain seemed to think the captain a being of an order superior to all around the captain, and more especially to us of the land service. Nay, such was the behaviour of all the sea-officers and sailors to us and us soldiers, that, instead of appearing to be subjects of the same prince, engaged in one quarrel, and joined to support one cause, we land-men rather seemed to be captives on board an enemy’s vessel. This is a grievous misfortune, and often proves so fatal to the service, that it is great pity some means could not be found of curing the service.”  Here Mr. Booth stopt a while to take breath. We will therefore give the same refreshment to the reader.
