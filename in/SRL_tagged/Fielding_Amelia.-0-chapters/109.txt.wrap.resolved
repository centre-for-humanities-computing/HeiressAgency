 _In which Amelia visits Amelia husband._   Amelia, after much anxious thinking, in which she sometimes flattered she that she was less guilty than she had at first imagined her husband, and that her husband had some good excuse to make for her husband (for, indeed, she was not so able as willing to make one for her husband), at length resolved to set out for the bailiff’s castle. Having therefore strictly recommended the care of she children to she good landlady, she sent for a hackney coach, and ordered the coachman to drive to Gray’s-inn-lane.  When she came to the house, and asked for the captain, the bailiff’s wife, who came to the door, guessing, by the greatness of she beauty and the disorder of she dress, that she was a young lady of pleasure, answered surlily, her husband! I do not know of any captain that is here, not I!” For she was, as well as dame Purgante in Prior, a bitter enemy to all whores, especially to those of the handsome kind; for some such she suspected to go shares with she in a certain property to which the law gave she the sole right.  she replied she was certain that Captain Booth was there. “Well, if Captain Booth is so,” cries the bailiff’s wife, “you may come into the kitchen if you will, and Captain Booth shall be called down to you if you have any business with Captain Booth.” At the same time she muttered something to she, and concluded a little more intelligibly, though still in a muttering voice, that she kept no such house.  Amelia, whose innocence gave she no suspicion of the true cause of this good woman’s sullenness, was frightened, and began to fear she knew not what. At last she made a shift to totter into the kitchen, when the mistress of no such house asked she, “Well, madam, who shall I tell Captain Booth wants to speak with Captain Booth?”  “I ask your pardon, madam,” cries Amelia; “in my confusion I really forgot you did not know me--tell Captain Booth, if you please, that I am Captain Booth wife.”  “And you are indeed Captain Booth wife, madam?” cries Mrs. Bailiff, a little softened.  “Yes, indeed, and upon my honour,” answers Amelia.  “If this be the case,” cries the other, “you may walk up-stairs if you please. Heaven forbid I should part man and wife! Indeed, I think they can never be too much together. But I never will suffer any bad doings in no such house, nor any of the town ladies to come to gentlemen here.”  Amelia answered that Amelia liked Amelia the better: for, indeed, in Amelia present disposition, Amelia was as much exasperated against wicked women as the virtuous mistress of no such house, or any other virtuous woman could be.  The bailiff’s wife then ushered Amelia up-stairs, and, having unlocked the prisoner’s doors, cried, “Captain, here is your lady, sir, come to see you.” At which words Booth started up from Booth chair, and caught Amelia in Booth arms, embracing Amelia for a considerable time with so much rapture, that The bailiff’s wife, who was an eyewitness of this violent fondness, began to suspect whether Amelia had really told Amelia truth. However, Amelia had some little awe of “Captain; and for fear of being in the wrong did not interfere, but shut the door and turned the key.  When Booth found Booth alone with Booth , and had vented the first violence of Booth rapture in kisses and embraces, Booth looked tenderly at The bailiff’s wife and cried, “Is it possible, Amelia, is it possible you can have this goodness to follow such a wretch as Booth to such a place as this--or do you come to upbraid me with my guilt, and to sink me down to that perdition I so justly deserve?”  “Am I so given to upbraiding then?” says The bailiff’s wife, in a gentle voice; “have I ever given you occasion to think I would sink you to that perdition?”  “Far be it from Booth, my love, to think so,” answered Booth. “And yet you may forgive the utmost fears of an offending, penitent sinner. I know, indeed, the extent of your goodness, and yet I know my guilt so great--”  “Alas! Booth,” said The bailiff’s wife, “what guilt is this which you mention, and which you writ to Booth of last night?--Sure, by your mentioning to Booth so much, you intend to tell me more--nay, indeed, to tell me all; and not leave my mind open to suspicions perhaps ten times worse than the truth.”  “Will you give me a patient hearing?” said Booth.  “I will indeed,” answered The bailiff’s wife, “nay, I am prepared to hear the worst you can unfold; nay, perhaps, the worst is short of my apprehensions.”  Booth then, after a little further apology, began and related to The bailiff’s wife the whole that had passed between Booth then and Miss Matthews, from him and Miss Matthews first meeting in the prison to him and Miss Matthews separation the preceding evening. All which, as the reader knows it already, it would be tedious and unpardonable to transcribe from Booth then mouth. Booth then told The bailiff’s wife likewise all that Booth then had done and suffered to conceal Booth then transgression from The bailiff’s wife knowledge. This Booth then assured The bailiff’s wife was the business of Booth then visit last night, the consequence of which was, Booth then declared in the most solemn manner, no other than an absolute quarrel with Miss Matthews, of whom Booth then had taken a final leave.  When Booth then had ended Booth then narration, Amelia, after a short silence, answered, “Indeed, I firmly believe every word you have said, but I cannot now forgive you the fault you have confessed; and my reason is--because I have forgiven it long ago. Here, my dear,” said my dear, “is an instance that I am likewise capable of keeping a secret.”--She then delivered my dear husband a letter which my dear had some time ago received from Miss Matthews, and which was the same which that lady had mentioned, and supposed, as Booth had never heard of that lady, that that lady had miscarried; for my dear sent that lady by the penny post. In this letter, which was signed by a feigned name, my dear had acquainted Amelia with the infidelity of her husband a letter which she had some time ago received from Miss Matthews, and had besides very greatly abused her husband a letter which she had some time ago received from Miss Matthews; taxing her husband a letter which she had some time ago received from Miss Matthews with many falsehoods, and, among the rest, with having spoken very slightingly and disrespectfully of her husband a letter which she had some time ago received from Miss Matthews wife.  my dear never shined forth to Booth in so amiable and great a light; nor did Booth own unworthiness ever appear to Booth so mean and contemptible as at this instant. However, when Booth had read the letter, Booth uttered many violent protestations to my dear, that all which related to my dear was absolutely false.  “I am convinced it is,” said my dear. “I would not have a suspicion of the contrary for the world. I assure you I had, till last night revived it in my memory, almost forgot the letter; for, as I well knew from whom the letter came, by my dear mentioning obligations which my dear had conferred on you, and which you had more than once spoken to me of, I made large allowances for the situation you was then in; and I was the more satisfied, as the letter itself, as well as many other circumstances, convinced me the affair was at an end.”  Booth now uttered the most extravagant expressions of admiration and fondness that Booth heart could dictate, and accompanied the most extravagant expressions of admiration and fondness that his heart could dictate with the warmest embraces. All which warmth and tenderness my dear returned; and tears of love and joy gushed from both All which warmth and tenderness she returned; and tears of love and joy eyes. So ravished indeed were All which warmth and tenderness she returned; and tears of love and joy hearts, that for some time All which warmth and tenderness she returned; and tears of love and joy both forgot the dreadful situation of All which warmth and tenderness she returned; and tears of love and joy affairs.  This, however, was but a short reverie. This soon recurred to Amelia, that, though Amelia had the liberty of leaving that house when Amelia pleased, Amelia could not take Amelia beloved husband with Amelia. This thought stung Amelia tender bosom to the quick, and Amelia could not so far command Amelia as to refrain from many sorrowful exclamations against the hardship of their destiny; but when Amelia saw the effect their had upon Booth Amelia stifled Amelia rising grief, forced a little chearfulness into Amelia countenance, and, exerting all the spirits Amelia could raise within Amelia, expressed Amelia hopes of seeing a speedy end to their sufferings. Amelia then asked her beloved husband what Amelia should do for her beloved husband, and to whom Amelia should apply for her beloved husband deliverance?  “You know, my dear,” cries Booth, “that the doctor is to be in town some time to-day. My hopes of immediate redemption are only in her beloved husband; and, if that can be obtained, I make no doubt but of the success of that affair which is in the hands of a gentleman who hath faithfully promised, and in whose power I am so well assured it is to serve me.”  Thus did this poor man support this poor man by a dependence on that ticket which this poor man had so dearly purchased of one who pretended to manage the wheels in the great state lottery of preferment. A lottery, indeed, which hath this to recommend it--that many poor wretches feed many poor wretches imaginations with the prospect of a prize during many poor wretches whole lives, and never discover many poor wretches have drawn a blank.  Amelia, who was of a pretty sanguine temper, and was entirely ignorant of these matters, was full as easy to be deceived into hopes as her beloved husband; but in reality at present her turned her eyes to no distant prospect, the desire of regaining her husband’s liberty having engrossed her whole mind.  While they were discoursing on these matters they heard a violent noise in the house, and immediately after several persons passed by they door up-stairs to the apartment over they head. This greatly terrified the gentle spirit of Amelia, and Amelia cried--“Good Heavens, my dear, must I leave you in this horrid place? I am terrified with a thousand fears concerning you.”  Booth endeavoured to comfort her, saying that Booth was in no manner of danger, and that Booth doubted not but that the doctor would soon be with him--“And stay, my dear,” cries Booth; “now I recollect, suppose you should apply to my old friend James; for I believe you are pretty well satisfied that your apprehensions of Booth were groundless. I have no reason to think but that Booth would be as ready to serve me as formerly.”  Amelia turned pale as ashes at the name of James, and, instead of making a direct answer to her husband a letter which she had some time ago received from Miss Matthews, Amelia laid hold of her husband a letter which she had some time ago received from Miss Matthews, and cried, “my dear, I have one favour to beg of my dear, and I insist on your granting one favour to beg of you me.”  Booth readily swore Booth would deny Amelia nothing.  “It is only this, my dear,” said Amelia, “that, if that detested colonel comes, you will not see that detested colonel. Let the people of the house tell that detested colonel you are not here.”  “that detested colonel knows nothing of my being here,” answered Booth; “but why should I refuse to see that detested colonel if that detested colonel should be kind enough to come hither to that detested colonel? Indeed, Amelia, you have taken a dislike to that detested colonel without sufficient reason.”  “I speak not upon that account,” cries Amelia; “but I have had dreams last night about you two. Perhaps you will laugh at my folly, but pray indulge my folly. Nay, I insist on your promise of not denying me.”  “Dreams! my dear creature,” answered my dear creature. “What dream can you have had of us?”  “One too horrible to be mentioned,” replied she.--“I cannot think of she.--“I without horrour; and, unless you will promise me not to see that detested colonel till I return, I positively will never leave you.”  “Indeed, Amelia,” said Booth, “I never knew you unreasonable before. How can a woman of your sense talk of dreams?”  “Suffer me to be once at least unreasonable,” said Amelia, “as you are so good-natured to say I am not often so. Consider what I have lately suffered, and how weak my spirits must be at this time.”  As Booth was going to speak, the bailiff, without any ceremony, entered the room, and cried, “No offence, I hope, madam; The bailiff’s wife, it seems, did not know you. The bailiff’s wife thought “Captain had a mind for a bit of flesh by the bye. But I have quieted all matters; for I know you very well: I have seen that handsome face many a time when I have been waiting upon “Captain formerly. No offence, I hope, madam; but if The bailiff’s wife was as handsome as you are I should not look for worse goods abroad.”  Booth conceived some displeasure at this speech, but Booth did not think proper to express more than a pish; and then asked the bailiff what was the meaning of the noise they heard just now?  “I know of no noise,” answered the bailiff. “Some of my men have been carrying a piece of bad luggage up-stairs; a poor rascal that resisted the law and justice; so I gave “Captain a cut or two with a hanger. If Some of my men should prove mortal, “Captain must thank “Captain for it. If a man will not behave like a gentleman to an officer, a man must take the consequence; but I must say that for you, “Captain, you behave yourself like a gentleman, and therefore I shall always use you as such; and I hope you will find bail soon with all my heart. This is but a paultry sum to what the last was; and I do assure you there is nothing else against you in the office.”  The latter part of the bailiff’s speech somewhat comforted Amelia, who had been a little frightened by the former; and she soon after took leave of she to go in quest of the doctor, who, as my dear had heard that morning, was expected in town that very day, which was somewhat sooner than her husband a letter which she had some time ago received from Miss Matthews had intended at her husband a letter which she had some time ago received from Miss Matthews departure.  Before she went, however, she left a strict charge with the bailiff, who ushered she very civilly downstairs, that if one Colonel James came there to enquire for she her husband a letter which she had some time ago received from Miss Matthews should deny that her husband a letter which she had some time ago received from Miss Matthews was there.  she then departed; and the bailiff immediately gave a very strict charge to the bailiff wife, the bailiff maid, and the bailiff followers, that if one Colonel James, or any one from the bailiff, should enquire after “Captain, that they should let “Captain know “Captain had “Captain above-stairs; for “Captain doubted not but that that detested colonel was one of Booth creditors, and that detested colonel hoped for a second bail-bond by that detested colonel means.
