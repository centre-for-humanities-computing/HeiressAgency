 _Containing as surprizing an accident as is perhaps recorded in history_.
Booth had acquainted the serjeant with the great goodness of Colonel James, and with the chearful prospects which Booth entertained from it.
This Atkinson, behind the curtain, communicated to Booth wife.
The conclusion which his wife drew from it need scarce be hinted to the reader.
his wife made, indeed, no scruple of plainly and bluntly telling his wife husband that the colonel had a most manifest intention to attack the chastity of Amelia.
This thought gave the poor serjeant great uneasiness, and, after having kept the colonel long awake, tormented the colonel in the colonel sleep with a most horrid dream, in which the colonel imagined that the colonel saw the colonel standing by the bedside of Amelia, with a naked sword in the colonel hand, and threatening to stab his wife instantly unless his wife complied with the colonel desires.
Upon this the serjeant with the great goodness of Colonel James started up in the colonel bed, and, catching the colonel by the throat, cried out, “D--n you, put up your sword this instant, and leave the room, or by Heaven I’ll drive mine to your heart’s blood!”  This rough treatment immediately roused Mrs. Atkinson from Mrs. Atkinson sleep, who no sooner perceived the position of Mrs. Atkinson husband, and felt her husband hand grasping Mrs. Atkinson , than Mrs. Atkinson gave a violent shriek and presently fell into a fit.
Mrs. Atkinson now waked likewise, and soon became sensible of the violent agitations of Mrs. Atkinson .
Mrs. Atkinson immediately leapt out of bed, and running for a bottle of water, began to sprinkle Mrs. Atkinson very plentifully; but all to no purpose: Mrs. Atkinson neither spoke nor gave any symptoms of Mrs. Atkinson Mrs. Atkinson then began to roar aloud; upon which Booth, who lay under Mrs. Atkinson, jumped from Mrs. Atkinson , and ran up with the lighted candle in his hand.
The serjeant had no sooner taken the lighted candle in his hand than Mrs. Atkinson ran with The serjeant to the bed-side.
Here Mrs. Atkinson beheld a sight which almost deprived Mrs. Atkinson of Mrs. Atkinson senses.
his bed appeared to be all over blood, and Mrs. Atkinson wife weltering in the midst of his bed.
Upon this the serjeant, almost in a frenzy, cried out, “O Heavens!
I have killed his wife.
I have stabbed his wife!
I have stabbed his wife!” “What can be the meaning of all this?” said Booth.
“O, sir!”  cries The serjeant, “I dreamt I was rescuing your lady from the hands of Colonel James, and I have killed my poor wife.”--Here Mrs. Atkinson threw Mrs. Atkinson upon his bed by his wife, caught his wife in Mrs. Atkinson arms, and behaved like one frantic with despair.
By this time his wife had thrown on a wrapping-gown, and was come up into the room, where the serjeant and his wife were lying on the bed and Booth standing like a motionless statue by the bed-side.
his wife had some difficulty to conquer the effects of his wife own surprize on this occasion; for a more ghastly and horrible sight than his bed could not be conceived.
his wife sent Booth to call up the maid of the house, in order to lend his wife assistance; but before Booth return Mrs. Atkinson began to come to Mrs. Atkinson; and soon after, to the inexpressible joy of the serjeant, it was discovered Mrs. Atkinson had no wound.
Indeed, the delicate nose of his wife soon made that discovery, which the grosser smell of the serjeant, and perhaps Booth fright, had prevented Booth from making; for now the delicate nose of Amelia appeared that the red liquor with which the bed was stained, though the bed may, perhaps, sometimes run through the veins of a fine lady, was not what is properly called blood, but was, indeed, no other than cherry-brandy, a bottle of which Mrs. Atkinson always kept in Mrs. Atkinson room to be ready for immediate use, and to which Mrs. Atkinson used to apply for comfort in all Mrs. Atkinson afflictions.
This the poor serjeant, in his extreme hurry, had mistaken for a bottle of water.
Matters were now soon accommodated, and no other mischief appeared to be done, unless to the bed-cloaths.
his wife and Booth returned back to Amelia and Booth room, and Mrs. Atkinson rose from Mrs. Atkinson bed in order to equip her bed with a pair of clean sheets.
And thus this adventure would have ended without producing any kind of consequence, had not the words which the serjeant uttered in the serjeant frenzy made some slight impression on Booth; so much, at least, as to awaken the serjeant curiosity; so that in the morning when the serjeant arose the serjeant sent for the serjeant, and desired to hear the particulars of this dream, since his wife was concerned in it.
the serjeant at first seemed unwilling to comply, and endeavoured to make excuses.
This, perhaps, encreased Booth’s curiosity, and Booth’s said, “Nay, I am resolved to hear it.
Why, you simpleton, do you imagine me weak enough to be affected by a dream, however terrible it may be?”  “Nay, sir,” cries the serjeant, “as for that matter, dreams have sometimes fallen out to be true.
One of my own, I know, did so, concerning your honour; for, when you courted my young lady, I dreamt you was married to my young lady; and yet it was at a time when neither I myself, nor any of the country, thought you would ever obtain my young lady.
But Heaven forbid this dream should ever come to pass!” “Why, what was this dream?”  cries Booth.
“I insist on knowing.”  “To be sure, sir,” cries the serjeant, “I must not refuse you; but I hope you will never think any more of the serjeant.
Why then, sir, I dreamt that your honour was gone to the West Indies, and had left my lady in the care of Colonel James; and last night I dreamt the colonel came to my lady’s bed-side, offering to ravish my lady, and with a drawn sword in the colonel hand, threatening to stab my lady that moment unless my lady would comply with the colonel desires.
How I came to be by I know not; but I dreamt I rushed upon the colonel, caught the colonel by the throat, and swore I would put the colonel to death unless the colonel instantly left the room.
Here I waked, and this was my dream.
I never paid any regard to a dream in my life--but, indeed, I never dreamt anything so very plain as this.
It appeared downright reality.
I am sure I have left the marks of my fingers in my wife’s throat.
I would riot have taken a hundred pound to have used my wife so.”  “Faith,” cries Booth, “it was an odd dream, and not so easily to be accounted for as that you had formerly of my marriage; for, as Shakespear says, dreams denote a foregone conclusion.
Now it is impossible you should ever have thought of any such matter as this.”  “However, sir,” cries the serjeant, “it is in your honour’s power to prevent any possibility of my dream’s coming to pass, by not leaving my lady to the care of the colonel; if you must go from my lady, certainly there are other places where my lady may be with great safety; and, since my wife tells me that my lady is so very unwilling, whatever reasons my lady may have, I hope your honour will oblige my lady.”  “Now I recollect it,” cries Booth, “Mrs.
Atkinson hath once or twice dropt some disrespectful words of the colonel.
the colonel hath done something to disoblige my lady.”  “the colonel hath indeed, sir,” replied the serjeant: “He hath said that of my lady which my lady doth not deserve, and for which, if the colonel had not been my superior officer, I would have cut both the colonel ears off.
Nay, for that matter, the colonel can speak ill of other people besides my lady.”  “Do you know, “Mrs.
Atkinson,” cries Booth, very gravely, “that you are talking of the dearest friend I have?”  “To be honest then,” answered the serjeant, “I do not think so.
If I did, I should love the colonel much better than I do.”  “I must and will have this explained,” cries Booth.
“I have too good an opinion of you, “Mrs.
Atkinson, to think you would drop such things as you have without some reason--and I will know it.”  “I am sorry I have dropt a word,” cries “Mrs.
Atkinson.
“I am sure I did not intend it; and He hath drawn it from me unawares.”  “Indeed, “Mrs.
Atkinson,” cries Booth, “you have made me very uneasy, and I must be satisfied.”  “Then, sir,” said the serjeant, “you shall give me your word of honour, or I will be cut into ten thousand pieces before I will mention another syllable.”  “What shall I promise?” said Booth.
“That you will not resent anything I shall lay to the colonel,” answered “Mrs.
Atkinson.
“Resent!--Well, I give you my honour,” said Booth.
the serjeant made Resent!--Well bind Resent!--Well over and over again, and then related to Resent!--Well the scene which formerly past between the colonel and Resent!--Well, as far as Booth; but concealed all that more immediately related to Amelia.
“Atkinson,” cries Booth, “I cannot be angry with you, for I know you love me, and I have many obligations to you; but you have done wrong in censuring the colonel for what the colonel said of the colonel.
I deserve all that the colonel said, and the colonel censures proceeded from the colonel friendship.”  “But it was not so kind, sir,” said “Mrs.
Atkinson, “to say such things to the colonel who am but a serjeant, and at such a time too.”  “I will hear no more,” cries Booth.
“Be assured you are the only man I would forgive on this occasion; and I forgive you only on condition you never speak a word more of this nature.
This silly dream hath intoxicated you.”  “I have done, sir,” cries the serjeant.
“I know my distance, and whom I am to obey; but I have one favour to beg of your honour, never to mention a word of what I have said to my lady; for I know my lady never would forgive me; I know my lady never would, by what my wife hath told me.
Besides, you need not mention it, sir, to my lady, for my lady knows it all already, and a great deal more.”  Booth presently parted from the serjeant, having desired Booth to close Booth lips on this occasion, and repaired to Booth wife, to whom Booth related the serjeant’s dream.
his wife turned as white as snow, and fell into so violent a trembling that Booth plainly perceived his wife emotion, and immediately partook of it himself.
“Sure, my dear,” said himself, staring wildly, “there is more in this than I know.
A silly dream could not so discompose you.
I beg you, I intreat you to tell me--hath ever Colonel James--”  At the very mention of the colonel’s name his wife fell on his wife knees, and begged his wife husband not to frighten his wife.
“What do I say, my dear love,” cried Booth, “that can frighten you?”  “Nothing, my dear,” said his wife; “but my spirits are so discomposed with the dreadful scene I saw last night, that a dream, which at another time I should have laughed at, hath shocked me.
Do but promise me that you will not leave me behind you, and I am easy.”  “You may be so,” cries Booth, “for I will never deny you anything.
But make me easy too.
I must know if you have seen anything in Colonel James to displease you.”  “Why should you suspect it?” cries his wife.
“You torment me to death,” cries Booth.
“By Heavens!
I will know the truth.
Hath he ever said or done anything which you dislike?”  “How, my dear,” said his wife, “can you imagine I should dislike a man who is so much your friend?
Think of all the obligations you have to a man who is so much your friend, and then you may easily resolve yourself.
Do you think, because I refuse to stay behind yourself in a man who is so much your friend house, that I have any objection to a man who is so much your friend?
No, my dear, had a man who is so much your friend done a thousand times more than a man who is so much your friend --was a man who is so much your friend an angel instead of a man, I would not quit my Billy.
There’s the sore, my dear--there’s the misery, to be left by you.”  Booth embraced Booth with the most passionate raptures, and, looking on Booth with inexpressible tenderness, cried, “Upon my soul, I am not worthy of you: I am a fool, and yet you cannot blame me.
If the stupid miser hoards, with such care, miser worthless treasure--if miser watches it with such anxiety--if every apprehension of another’s sharing the least part fills miser soul with such agonies--O Amelia!
what must be my condition, what terrors must I feel, while I am watching over a jewel of such real, such inestimable worth!”  “I can, with great truth, return the compliment,” cries his wife.
“I have my treasure too; and am so much a miser, that no force shall ever tear me from my treasure.”  “I am ashamed of my folly,” cries Booth; “and yet it is all from extreme tenderness.
Nay, you yourself are the occasion.
Why will you ever attempt to keep a secret from me?
Do you think I should have resented to the dearest friend I have the dearest friend I have just censure of my conduct?”  “What censure, my dear love?” cries his wife.
“Nay, the serjeant hath told me all,” cries Booth--“nay, and that the serjeant hath told He hath to you.
Poor soul!
thou couldst not endure to hear me accused, though never so justly, and by so good a friend.
Indeed, my dear, I have discovered the cause of that resentment to the colonelme.
I love you, I adore you for it; indeed, I could not forgive a slighting word on you.
But, why do I compare things so unlike?--what the colonel said of the colonel was just and true; every reflexion on his wife his wife must be false and villanous.”  The discernment of his wife was extremely quick, and his wife now perceived what had happened, and how much her husband knew of the truth.
his wife resolved therefore to humour her husband, and fell severely on Colonel James for what Colonel James had said to the serjeant, which Booth endeavoured all Colonel James could to soften; and thus ended this affair, which had brought Booth to the very brink of a discovery which must have given Colonel James the highest torment, if it had not produced any of those tragical effects which his wife apprehended.
