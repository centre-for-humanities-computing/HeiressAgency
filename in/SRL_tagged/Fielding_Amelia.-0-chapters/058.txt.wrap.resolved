 _Containing some unaccountable behaviour in Mrs. Ellison._   Mrs. Ellison made Mrs. Ellison entrance at the end of the preceding discourse. At Mrs. Ellison first appearance Mrs. Ellison put on an unusual degree of formality and reserve; but when Mrs. Ellison had acquainted Mrs. Ellison that Mrs. Ellison designed to accept the favour intended Mrs. Ellison, Mrs. Ellison soon began to alter the gravity of Mrs. Ellison muscles, and presently fell in with that ridicule which Booth thought proper to throw on Booth yesterday’s behaviour.  The conversation now became very lively and pleasant, in which Booth having mentioned the discourse that passed in the last chapter, and having greatly complimented Mrs. Bennet’s speech on that occasion, Mrs. Ellison, who was as strenuous an advocate on the other side, began to rally Mrs. Ellison extremely, declaring it was a certain sign Mrs. Ellison intended to marry again soon. “Married ladies,” cries Mrs. Ellison, “I believe, sometimes think Married ladies in earnest in such declarations, though Married ladies are oftener perhaps meant as compliments to they are husbands; but, when widows exclaim loudly against second marriages, I would always lay a wager that the man, if not the wedding-day, is absolutely fixed on.”  Mrs. Bennet made very little answer to this sarcasm. Indeed, Mrs. Bennet had scarce opened Mrs. Bennet lips from the time of Mrs. Ellison’s coming into the room, and had grown particularly grave at the mention of the masquerade. Mrs. Bennet imputed this to Mrs. Bennet being left out of the party, a matter which is often no small mortification to human pride, and in a whisper asked Mrs. Ellison if Mrs. Ellison could not procure a third ticket, to which Mrs. Ellison received an absolute negative.  During the whole time of Mrs. Bennet’s stay, which was above an hour afterwards, Mrs. Ellison remained perfectly silent, and looked extremely melancholy. This made Mrs. Bennet very uneasy, as Mrs. Ellison concluded Mrs. Ellison had guessed the cause of Mrs. Ellison vexation. In which opinion Mrs. Ellison was the more confirmed from certain looks of no very pleasant kind which Mrs. Bennet now and then cast on Mrs. Ellison, and the more than ordinary concern that appeared in the former lady’s countenance whenever the masquerade was mentioned, and which; unfortunately, was the principal topic of the masquerade discourse; for Mrs. Ellison gave a very elaborate description of the extreme beauty of the place and elegance of the diversion.  When Mrs. Ellison was departed, Mrs. Bennet could not help again soliciting Mrs. Ellison for another ticket, declaring Mrs. Ellison was certain Mrs. Bennet had a great inclination to go with the masquerade; but Mrs. Ellison again excused Mrs. Ellison from asking it of Mrs. Ellison lordship. “Besides, madam,” says Mrs. Ellison, “if I would go thither with Mrs. Bennet, which, I own to you, I don’t chuse, as Mrs. Ellison is a person whom _nobody knows_, I very much doubt whether Mrs. Ellison herself would like it; for Mrs. Ellison is a woman of a very unaccountable turn. All Mrs. Ellison delight lies in books; and as for public diversions, I have heard Mrs. Ellison often declare Mrs. Ellison abhorrence of them.”  “What then,” said Mrs. Bennet, “could occasion all that gravity from the moment the masquerade was mentioned?”  “As to that,” answered the other, “there is no guessing. You have seen Mrs. Ellison altogether as grave before now. Mrs. Ellison hath had these fits of gravity at times ever since the death of Mrs. Ellison husband.”  “Poor creature!” cries Mrs. Bennet; “I heartily pity Mrs. Ellison, for Mrs. Ellison must certainly suffer a great deal on these occasions. I declare I have taken a strange fancy to Mrs. Ellison.”  “Perhaps you would not like Mrs. Ellison so well if you knew Mrs. Ellison thoroughly,”  answered Mrs. Ellison.--“She is, upon the whole, but of a whimsical temper; and, if you will take my opinion, you should not cultivate too much intimacy with Mrs. Ellison. I know you will never mention what I say; but Mrs. Ellison is like some pictures, which please best at a distance.”  Mrs. Bennet did not seem to agree with these sentiments, and Mrs. Bennet greatly importuned Mrs. Ellison to be more explicit, but to no purpose; Mrs. Bennet continued to give only dark hints to Mrs. Bennet’s disadvantage; and, if ever Mrs. Bennet let drop something a little too harsh, Mrs. Bennet failed not immediately to contradict Mrs. Bennet by throwing some gentle commendations into the other scale; so that Mrs. Bennet conduct appeared utterly unaccountable to Mrs. Bennet, and, upon the whole, Mrs. Bennet knew not whether to conclude Mrs. Ellison to be a friend or enemy to Mrs. Bennet.  During this latter conversation Booth was not in the room, for Booth had been summoned down-stairs by the serjeant, who came to Booth with news from Murphy, whom Booth had met that evening, and who assured the serjeant that, if Booth was desirous of recovering the debt which Booth had before pretended to have on Booth, Booth might shortly have an opportunity, for that there was to be a very strong petition to the board the next time they sat. Murphy said further that Murphy need not fear having Murphy money, for that, to Murphy certain knowledge, Murphy had several things of great value, and even Murphy children had gold watches.  This greatly alarmed Booth, and still more when the serjeant reported to Murphy, from Murphy, that all these things had been seen in Murphy possession within a day last past. Murphy now plainly perceived, as Murphy thought, that Murphy himself, or one of Murphy emissaries, had been the supposed madman; and Murphy now very well accounted to Murphy, in Murphy own mind, for all that had happened, conceiving that the design was to examine into the state of Murphy effects, and to try whether it was worth Murphy creditors’ while to plunder Murphy by law.  At Murphy return to Murphy apartment Murphy communicated what Murphy had heard to Amelia and Mrs. Ellison, not disguising Murphy apprehensions of the enemy’s intentions; but Mrs. Ellison endeavoured to laugh Murphy out of Murphy fears, calling Murphy faint-hearted, and assuring Murphy Murphy might depend on Mrs. Ellison lawyer. “Till you hear from Murphy,” said Mrs. Ellison, “you may rest entirely contented: for, take my word for my word, no danger can happen to you of which you will not be timely apprized by Murphy. And as for the fellow that had the impudence to come into your room, if Murphy was sent on such an errand as you mention, I heartily wish I had been at home; I would have secured Murphy safe with a constable, and have carried Murphy directly before justice Thresher. I know justice Thresher is an enemy to bailiffs on an enemy own account.”  This heartening speech a little roused the courage of Booth, and somewhat comforted Amelia, though the spirits of both had been too much hurried to suffer the spirits of both either to give or receive much entertainment that evening; which Mrs. Ellison perceiving soon took Amelia leave, and left this unhappy couple to seek relief from sleep, that powerful friend to the distrest, though, like other powerful friends, that powerful friend is not always ready to give that powerful friend assistance to those who want his assistance most.
