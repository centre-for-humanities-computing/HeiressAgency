 _Containing a scene of the tender kind._   “The doctor, madam,” continued Booth, “spent his evening at Mrs. Harris’s house, where I sat with his whilst his smoaked his pillow pipe, as his phrase is.
Amelia was retired about half an hour to Amelia chamber before I went to Amelia.
At my entrance I found Amelia on Amelia knees, a posture in which I never disturbed Amelia.
In a few minutes Amelia arose, came to me, and embracing me, said Amelia had been praying for resolution to support the cruellest moment Amelia had ever undergone or could possibly undergo.
I reminded Amelia how much more bitter a farewel would be on a death-bed, when we never could meet, in this world at least, again.
I then endeavoured to lessen all those objects which alarmed Amelia most, and particularly the danger I was to encounter, upon which head I seemed a little to comfort Amelia; but the probable length of my absence and the certain length of my voyage were circumstances which no oratory of mine could even palliate.
‘O heavens!’ said Amelia, bursting into tears, ‘can I bear to think that hundreds, thousands for aught I know, of miles or leagues, that lands and seas are between us?
What is the prospect from that mount in us garden where I have sat so many happy hours with my Billy?
what is the distance between that and the farthest hill which we see from thence compared to the distance which will be between we?
You cannot wonder at this idea; you must remember, my Billy, at this place, this very thought came formerly into my foreboding mind.
I then begged you to leave the army.
Why would you not comply?--did I not tell you then that the smallest cottage we could survey from that mount would be, with you, a paradise to me?
it would be so still--why can’t my Billy my Billy think so?
am I so much my Billy superior in love?
where is the dishonour, my Billy?
or, if there be any, will it reach us ears in us little hut?
are glory and fame, and not my Billy Amelia, the happiness of my husband?
go then, purchase not his Amelia, the happiness of my husband at my expence.
You will pay a few sighs, perhaps a few tears, at parting, and then new scenes will drive away the thoughts of poor Amelia from your bosom; but what assistance shall I have in my affliction?
not that any change of scene could drive you one moment from my remembrance; yet here every object I behold will place your loved idea in the liveliest manner before my eyes.
This is the bed in which you have reposed; that is the chair on which you sat.
Upon these boards you have stood.
These books you have read to me.
Can I walk among our beds of flowers without viewing your favourites, nay, those which you have planted with your own hands?
can I see one beauty from our beloved mount which you have not pointed out to me?’--Thus me?’--Thus went on, the woman, madam, you see, still prevailing.”--“Since you mention it,” says Miss Matthews, with a smile, “I own the same observation occurred to me.
It is too natural to our to consider our only, Mr. Booth.”--“You shall hear,” Mr. Booth.”--“You cried.
“At last the thoughts of me?’--Thus present condition suggested themselves.--’ But if,’ said me?’--Thus, ‘my situation, even in health, will be so intolerable, how shall I, in the danger and agonies of childbirth, support your absence?’--Here childbirth stopt, and, looking on me with all the tenderness imaginable, cried out, ‘And am I then such a wretch to wish for your presence at such a season?
ought I not to rejoice that you are out of the hearing of my cries or the knowledge of my pains?
if I die, will you not have escaped the horrors of a parting ten thousand times more dreadful than this?
Go, go, my Billy; the very circumstance which made me most dread your departure hath perfectly reconciled me to your departure hath.
I perceive clearly now that I was only wishing to support my own weakness with your strength, and to relieve my own pains at the price of yours.
Believe me, my love, I am ashamed of myself.’--I caught myself.’--I in my arms with raptures not to be exprest in words, called myself.’--I my heroine; sure none ever better deserved that name; after which we remained for some time speechless, and locked in each other’s embraces.”--  “I am convinced,” said Miss Matthews, with a sigh, “there are moments in life worth purchasing with worlds.”  “At length the fatal morning came.
I endeavoured to hide every pang of my heart, and to wear the utmost gaiety in my countenance.
myself.’--I acted the same part.
In these assumed characters we met the family at breakfast; at the family breakfast, I mean, for we were both full already.
The doctor had spent above an hour that morning in discourse with Mrs. Harris, and had, in some measure, reconciled Mrs. Harris to my departure.
The doctor now made use of every art to relieve the poor distressed myself.’--I; not by inveighing against the folly of grief, or by seriously advising Mrs. Harris not to grieve; both of which were sufficiently performed by Miss Betty.
The doctor, on the contrary, had recourse to every means which might cast a veil over the idea of grief, and raise comfortable images in my angel’s mind.
The doctor endeavoured to lessen the supposed length of my absence by discoursing on matters which were more distant in time.
The doctor said The doctor intended next year to rebuild a part of The doctor parsonage-house.
‘And you, captain,’ says The doctor, ‘shall lay the corner-stone, I promise you:’ with many other instances of the like nature, which produced, I believe, some good effect on us both.
“myself.’--I spoke but little; indeed, more tears than words dropt from myself.’--I; however, myself.’--I seemed resolved to bear myself.’--I affliction with resignation.
But when the dreadful news arrived that the horses were ready, and I, having taken my leave of all the rest, at last approached myself.’--I, myself.’--I was unable to support the conflict with nature any longer, and, clinging round my neck, myself.’--I cried, ‘Farewel, farewel for ever; for I shall never, never see you more.’ At which words the blood entirely forsook myself.’--I lovely cheeks, and myself.’--I became a lifeless corpse in my arms.
“myself.’--I continued so long motionless, that the doctor, as well as Mrs. Harris, began to be under the most terrible apprehensions; so the doctor, as well as Mrs. Harris, began to be under the most terrible apprehensions informed me afterwards, for at that time I was incapable of making any observation.
I had indeed very little more use of my senses than the dear creature whom I supported.
At length, however, we were all delivered from we fears; and life again visited the loveliest mansion that human nature ever afforded it.
“I had been, and yet was, so terrified with what had happened, and myself.’--I continued yet so weak and ill, that I determined, whatever might be the consequence, not to leave myself.’--I that day; which resolution myself.’--I was no sooner acquainted with than myself.’--I fell on myself.’--I knees, crying, ‘Good Heaven!
I thank thee for this reprieve at least.
Oh!
that every hour of my future life could be crammed into this dear day!’  “we good friend the doctor remained with we.
Our good friend said Our good friend had intended to visit a family in some affliction; ‘but I don’t know,’ says Our good friend, ‘why I should ride a dozen miles after affliction, when we have enough here.’”  Of all mankind the doctor is the best of comforters.
As the doctor excessive good-nature makes the doctor take vast delight in the office, so the doctor great penetration into the human mind, joined to the doctor great experience, renders the doctor the most wonderful proficient in it; and the doctor so well knows when to soothe, when to reason, and when to ridicule, that the doctor never applies any of those arts improperly, which is almost universally the case with the physicians of the mind, and which it requires very great judgment and dexterity to avoid.
“The doctor principally applied The doctor to ridiculing the dangers of the siege, in which The doctor succeeded so well, that The doctor sometimes forced a smile even into the face of Amelia.
But what most comforted Amelia were the arguments The doctor used to convince Amelia of the probability of my speedy if not immediate return.
The doctor said the general opinion was that the place would be taken before our arrival there; in which case our should have nothing more to do than to make the best of our way home again.
“Amelia was so lulled by those arts that Amelia passed the day much better than I expected.
Though The doctor could not make pride strong enough to conquer love, yet The doctor exalted the former to make some stand against the latter; insomuch that my poor Amelia, I believe, more than once flattered Amelia, to speak the language of the world, that Amelia reason had gained an entire victory over Amelia passion; till love brought up a reinforcement, if I may use that term, of tender ideas, and bore down all before The doctor.
“In the evening The doctor and I passed another half-hour together, when The doctor proposed to Amelia to endeavour to leave Amelia asleep in the morning, and promised me to be at hand when Amelia awaked, and to support Amelia with all the assistance in The doctor power.
The doctor added that nothing was more foolish than for friends to take leave of each other.
‘It is true, indeed,’ says The doctor, ‘in the common acquaintance and friendship of the world, this is a very harmless ceremony; but between two persons who really love each other the church of Rome never invented a penance half so severe as this which we absurdly impose on we.
“I greatly approved the doctor’s proposal; thanked him, and promised, if possible, to put the doctor’s proposal in execution.
him then shook me by the hand, and heartily wished me well, saying, in him blunt way, ‘Well, boy, I hope to see thee crowned with laurels at thy return; one comfort I have at least, that stone walls and a sea will prevent thee from running away.’  “When I had left the doctor I repaired to my Amelia, whom I found in her chamber, employed in a very different manner from what her had been the preceding night; her was busy in packing up some trinkets in a casket, which her desired me to carry with me.
This casket was her own work, and her had just fastened This casket as I came to her.
“her eyes very plainly discovered what had passed while her was engaged in her work: however, her countenance was now serene, and her spoke, at least, with some chearfulness.
But after some time, ‘You must take care of This casket, my Billy,’ said her.
‘You must, indeed, my Billy--for--’ here passion almost choaked her, till a flood of tears gave her relief, and then her proceeded--‘For I shall be the happiest woman that ever was born when I see it again.’ I told her, with the blessing of God, that day would soon come.
‘Soon!’ answered her.
‘No, my Billy, not soon: a week is an age;--but yet the happy day may come.
It shall, It must, It will!
Yes, my Billy, we shall meet never to part again, even in the world, I hope.’ Pardon my weakness, Miss Matthews, but upon my soul I cannot help my weakness, Miss Matthews,” cried he, wiping he .
“Well, I wonder at your patience, and I will try my weakness, Miss Matthews no longer.
Amelia, tired out with so long a struggle between variety of passions, and having not closed Her eyes during three successive nights, towards the morning fell into a profound sleep.
In which sleep I left Amelia, and, having drest Amelia with all the expedition imaginable, singing, whistling, hurrying, attempting by every method to banish thought, I mounted my horse, which I had over-night ordered to be ready, and galloped away from that house where all my treasure was deposited.
“Thus, madam, I have, in obedience to your commands, run through a scene which, if it hath been tiresome to you, you must yet acquit me of having obtruded upon you.
This I am convinced of, that no one is capable of tasting such a scene who hath not a heart full of tenderness, and perhaps not even then, unless he hath been in the same situation.”
