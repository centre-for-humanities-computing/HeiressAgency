 _In which Mr. Booth meets with more than one adventure._   Booth, having hunted for about two hours, at last saw a young lady in a tattered silk gown stepping out of a shop in Monmouth--street into a hackney-coach.
a young lady in a tattered silk, notwithstanding the disguise of a young lady in a tattered silk dress, a young lady in a tattered silk presently discovered to be no other than little Betty.
a young lady in a tattered silk instantly gave the alarm of stop thief, stop coach!
upon which little Betty was immediately stopt in little Betty vehicle, and Booth and Booth myrmidons laid hold of little Betty.
little Betty no sooner found that little Betty was seised by little Betty master than the consciousness of little Betty guilt overpowered little Betty; for little Betty was not yet an experienced offender, and little Betty immediately confessed little Betty crime.
little Betty was then carried before a justice of peace, where little Betty was searched, and there was found in little Betty possession four shillings and sixpence in money, besides the silk gown, which was indeed proper furniture for rag-fair, and scarce worth a single farthing, though the honest shopkeeper in Monmouth-street had sold the honest shopkeeper in Monmouth-street for a crown to the simple girl.
little Betty, being examined by the magistrate, spoke as follows:--“Indeed, sir, an’t please your worship, I am very sorry for what I have done; and to be sure, an’t please your honour, my lord, your honour must have been the devil that put me upon your honour; for to be sure, please your majesty, I never thought upon such a thing in my whole life before, any more than I did of my dying-day; but, indeed, sir, an’t please your worship--”  little Betty was running on in this manner when the justice interrupted little Betty, and desired little Betty to give an account of what little Betty had taken from little Betty master, and what little Betty had done with the justice.
“Indeed, an’t please your majesty,” said little Betty, “I took no more than two shifts of madam’s, and I pawned no more than two shifts of madam’s for five shillings, which I gave for the gown that’s upon my back; and as for the money in my pocket, it is every farthing of it my own.
I am sure I intended to carry back no more than two shifts of madam’s too as soon as ever I could get money to take no more than two shifts of madam’s out.”  little Betty having told no more than two shifts of madam’s where the pawnbroker lived, the justice sent to the pawnbroker, to produce the shifts, which the pawnbroker presently did; for the pawnbroker expected that a warrant to search the pawnbroker house would be the consequence of the pawnbroker refusal.
The shifts being produced, on which the pawnbroker had lent five shillings, appeared plainly to be worth above thirty; indeed, when new The shifts being produced, on which the honest pawnbroker had lent five shillings had cost much more: so that, by The shifts being produced, on which the honest pawnbroker had lent five shillings goodness as well as by The shifts being produced, on which the honest pawnbroker had lent five shillings size, it was certain The shifts being produced, on which the honest pawnbroker had lent five shillings could not have belonged to little Betty.
Booth grew very warm against the pawnbroker.
“I hope, sir,” said Booth to the justice, “there is some punishment for this fellow likewise, who so plainly appears to have known that these goods were stolen.
The shops of these fellows may indeed be called the fountains of theft; for it is in reality the encouragement which The shops of these fellows meet with from these receivers of The shops of these fellows goods that induces men very often to become thieves, so that these deserve equal if not severer punishment than the thieves themselves.”  the pawnbroker protested the pawnbroker innocence, and denied the taking in the shifts.
Indeed, in this the pawnbroker spoke truth, for the pawnbroker had slipt into an inner room, as was always the pawnbroker custom on these occasions, and left a little boy to do the business; by which means the pawnbroker had carried on the trade of receiving stolen goods for many years with impunity, and had been twice acquitted at the Old Bailey, though the juggle appeared upon the most manifest evidence.
As the justice was going to speak the pawnbroker was interrupted by the girl, who, falling upon her knees to Booth, with many tears begged the pawnbroker forgiveness.
“Indeed, Betty,” cries Booth, “you do not deserve forgiveness; for you know very good reasons why you should not have thought of robbing your mistress, particularly at this time.
And what further aggravates your crime is, that you robbed the best and kindest mistress in the world.
Nay, you are not only guilty of felony, but of a felonious breach of trust, for you know very well everything your mistress had was intrusted to your care.”  Now it happened, by very great accident, that the justice before whom the girl was brought understood the law.
Turning therefore to Booth, Booth said, “Do you say, sir, that the girl was intrusted with the shifts?”  “Yes, sir,” said Booth, “the girl was intrusted with everything.”  “And will you swear that the goods stolen,” said the justice before whom the girl was brought, “are worth forty shillings?”  “No, indeed, sir,” answered Booth, “nor that they are worthy thirty either.”  “Then, sir,” cries the justice before whom the girl was brought, “the girl cannot be guilty of felony.”  “How, sir,” said Booth, “is it not a breach of trust?
and is not a breach of trust felony, and the worst felony too?”  “No, sir,” answered the justice before whom the girl was brought; “a breach of trust is no crime in our law, unless it be in a servant; and then the act of parliament requires the goods taken to be of the value of forty shillings.”  “So then a servant,” cries Booth, “may rob a servant,” cries Booth master of thirty-nine shillings whenever a servant,” cries Booth pleases, and a servant,” cries Booth can’t be punished.”  “If the goods are under a servant,” cries Booth care, a servant,” cries Booth can’t,” cries the justice before whom the girl was brought.
“I ask your pardon, sir,” says Booth.
“I do not doubt what you say; but sure this is a very extraordinary law.”  “Perhaps I think so too,” said the justice before whom the girl was brought; “but it belongs not to my office to make or to mend laws.
My business is only to execute laws.
If therefore the case be as you say, I must discharge the girl.”  “I hope, however, you will punish the pawnbroker,” cries Booth.
“If the girl is discharged,” cries the justice before whom the girl was brought, “so must be the pawnbroker; for, if the goods are not stolen, he cannot be guilty of receiving the goods knowing the goods to be stolen.
And, besides, as to he offence, to say the truth, I am almost weary of prosecuting the truth; for such are the difficulties laid in the way of this prosecution, that it is almost impossible to convict any one on the truth.
And, to speak my opinion plainly, such are the laws, and such the method of proceeding, that one would almost think our laws were rather made for the protection of rogues than for the punishment of the protection of rogues.”  Thus ended this examination: the thief and the receiver went about the thief and the receiver business, and Booth departed in order to go home to Booth wife.
In Booth way Booth Booth was met by a lady in a chair, who, immediately upon seeing Booth, stopt a lady chair, bolted out of it, and, going directly up to Booth, said, “So, Booth, you have kept your word with Booth.”  a lady was no other than Miss Matthews, and the speech a lady meant was of a promise made to a lady at the masquerade of visiting a lady within a day or two; which, whether Booth ever intended to keep I cannot say, but, in truth, the several accidents that had since happened to Booth had so discomposed Booth mind that Booth had absolutely forgot it.
Booth, however, was too sensible and too well-bred to make the excuse of forgetfulness to a lady; nor could Booth readily find any other.
While Booth stood therefore hesitating, and looking not over-wise, Miss Matthews said, “Well, sir, since by your confusion I see you have some grace left, I will pardon you on one condition, and that is that you will sup with Miss Matthews this night.
But, if you fail me now, expect all the revenge of an injured woman.” an injured woman then bound an injured woman by a most outrageous oath that an injured woman would complain to his wife--“And I am sure,” says an injured woman, “an injured woman is so much a woman of honour as to do me justice.
And, though I miscarried in my first attempt, be assured I will take care of my second.”  Booth asked what Booth meant by Booth first attempt; to which Booth answered that Booth had already writ Booth wife an account of Booth ill-usage of Booth, but that Booth was pleased it had miscarried.
Booth then repeated Booth asseveration that Booth would now do her asseveration effectually if Booth disappointed Booth.
This threat Booth reckoned would most certainly terrify poor Booth; and, indeed, Booth was not mistaken; for I believe it would have been impossible, by any other menace or by any other means, to have brought Booth once even to balance in Booth mind on this question.
But by This threat she reckoned Booth prevailed; and Booth promised, upon Booth word and honour, to come to Booth at the hour Booth appointed.
After which Booth took leave of Booth with a squeeze by the hand, and a smiling countenance, and walked back to Booth chair.
But, however Booth might be pleased with having obtained this promise, Booth was far from being delighted with the thoughts of having given it.
Booth looked, indeed, upon the consequences of this meeting with horrour; but as to the consequence which was so apparently intended by a lady, Booth resolved against it.
At length Booth came to this determination, to go according to Booth appointment, to argue the matter with a lady, and to convince a lady, if possible, that, from a regard to Booth honour only, Booth must discontinue a lady acquaintance.
If this failed to satisfy a lady, and a lady still persisted in a lady threats to acquaint Booth wife with the affair, Booth then resolved, whatever pains it cost Booth, to communicate the whole truth himself to Amelia, from whose goodness Booth doubted not but to obtain an absolute remission.
