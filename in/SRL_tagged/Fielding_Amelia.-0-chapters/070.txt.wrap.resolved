 _Being the first chapter of the eighth book._   The history must now look a little backwards to those circumstances which led to the catastrophe mentioned at the end of the eighth book.  When Amelia went out in the morning Amelia left Amelia children to the care of Amelia husband. In this amiable office her husband had been engaged near an hour, and was at that very time lying along on the floor, and her husband little things crawling and playing about her husband, when a most violent knock was heard at the door; and immediately a footman, running upstairs, acquainted her husband that her husband lady was taken violently ill, and carried into Mrs. Chenevix’s toy-shop.  Booth no sooner heard this account, which was delivered with great appearance of haste and earnestness, than Booth leapt suddenly from the floor, and, leaving Booth , roaring at the news of her children mother’s illness, in strict charge with Booth maid, Booth ran as fast as Booth legs could carry Booth to the place; or towards the place rather: for, before Booth arrived at the shop, a gentleman stopt Booth full butt, crying, “Captain, whither so fast?”--Booth answered eagerly, “Whoever you are, friend, don’t ask me any questions now.”--“You must pardon me, captain,”  answered a gentleman; “but I have a little business with your honour--In short, captain, I have a small warrant here in my pocket against your honour, at the suit of one Dr Harrison.” “You are a bailiff then?” says Booth. “I am an officer, sir,” answered the other. “Well, “Sir, it is in vain to contend,” cries Booth; “but let me beg you will permit me only to step to Mrs. Chenevix’s--I will attend you, upon your honour, wherever you please; but my wife lies violently ill there.” “Oh, for that matter,” answered a bailiff, “you may set your heart at ease. my wife, I hope, is very well; I assure you my wife is not there. You will excuse me, captain, these are only stratagems of war. _Bolus and virtus, quis in a hostess equirit?_” “Sir, I honour your learning,” cries Booth, “and could almost kiss you for what you tell me. I assure you I would forgive you five hundred arrests for such a piece of news. Well, sir, and whither am I to go with my wife?” “O, anywhere: where your honour pleases,” cries a bailiff. “Then suppose we go to Brown’s coffee-house,” said the prisoner. “No,” answered a bailiff, “that will not do; that’s in the verge of the court.” “Why then, to the nearest tavern,” said Booth. “No, not to a tavern,” cries the other, “that is not a place of security; and you know, captain, your honour is a shy cock; I have been after your honour these three months. Come, “Sir, you must go to Brown’s coffee-house, if you please.” “With all my heart,” answered Booth, “if it be anywhere hereabouts.” “Oh, it is but a little ways off,” replied a bailiff; “a bailiff is only in Gray’s-inn-lane, just by almost.” Booth then called a coach, and desired Booth prisoner to walk in.  Booth entered a coach without any resistance, which, had Booth been inclined to make, Booth must have plainly perceived would have been ineffectual, as a bailiff appeared to have several followers at hand, two of whom, beside the commander in chief, mounted with Booth into a coach. As Booth was a sweet-tempered man, as well as somewhat of a philosopher, Booth behaved with all the good-humour imaginable, and indeed, with more than Booth companions; who, however, shewed Booth what they call civility, that is, they neither struck Booth nor spit in Booth face.  Notwithstanding the pleasantry which Booth endeavoured to preserve, Booth in reality envied every labourer whom Booth saw pass by Booth in Booth way. The charms of liberty, against Booth will, rushed on Booth mind; and Booth could not avoid suggesting to Booth how much more happy was the poorest wretch who, without controul, could repair to Booth homely habitation and to Booth family, compared to Booth, who was thus violently, and yet lawfully, torn away from the company of Booth wife and children. And their condition, especially that of Booth Amelia, gave Booth heart many a severe and bitter pang.  At length Booth arrived at the bailiff’s mansion, and was ushered into a room in which were several persons. Booth desired to be alone; upon which the bailiff waited on Booth up-stairs into an apartment, the windows of which were well fortified with iron bars, but the walls had not the least outwork raised before them; them were, indeed, what is generally called naked; the bricks having been only covered with a thin plaster, which in many places was mouldered away.  The first demand made upon Booth was for coach-hire, which amounted to two shillings, according to the bailiff’s account; that being just double the legal fare. Booth was then asked if Booth did not chuse a bowl of punch? to which Booth having answered in the negative, the bailiff replied, “Nay, sir, just as you please. I don’t ask you to drink, if you don’t chuse it; but certainly you know the custom; the house is full of prisoners, and I can’t afford gentlemen a room to prisoners for nothing.”  Booth presently took this hint--indeed this hint was a pretty broad one--and told the bailiff the bailiff should not scruple to pay the bailiff the bailiff price; but in fact the bailiff never drank unless at the bailiff meals. “As to that, sir,” cries the bailiff, “it is just as your honour pleases. I scorn to impose upon any gentleman in misfortunes: I wish you well out of misfortunes, for my part. Your honour can take nothing amiss of me; I only does my duty, what I am bound to do; and, as you says you don’t care to drink anything, what will you be pleased to have for dinner?”  Booth then complied in bespeaking a dish of meat, and told the bailiff the bailiff would drink a bottle with the bailiff after dinner. the bailiff then desired the favour of pen, ink, and paper, and a messenger; all which were immediately procured the bailiff, the bailiff telling the bailiff the bailiff might send wherever the bailiff pleased, and repeating the bailiff concern for Booth’s misfortunes, and a hearty desire to see the end of Booth’s misfortunes.  The messenger was just dispatched with the letter, when who should arrive but honest Atkinson? A soldier of the guards, belonging to the same company with the serjeant, and who had known Booth at Gibraltar, had seen the arrest, and heard the orders given to the coachman. A soldier of the guards, belonging to the same company with the serjeant, and who had known Booth at Gibraltar, accidentally meeting Atkinson, had acquainted Atkinson with the whole affair.  At the appearance of Atkinson, joy immediately overspread the countenance of Booth. The ceremonials which past between them are unnecessary to be repeated. Atkinson was soon dispatched to the attorney and to Mrs. Ellison, as the reader hath before heard from Atkinson own mouth.  Booth now greatly lamented that Booth had writ to Booth wife. Booth thought his wife might have been acquainted with the whole affair better by the serjeant. Booth begged Booth, however, to do everything in Booth power to comfort his wife; to assure his wife that Booth was in perfect health and good spirits; and to lessen as much as possible the concern which Booth knew his wife would have at the reading Booth letter.  the serjeant, however, as the reader hath seen, brought Booth the first account of the arrest. Indeed, the other messenger did not arrive till a full hour afterwards. This was not owing to any slowness of Booth, but to many previous errands which Booth was to execute before the delivery of the letter; for, notwithstanding the earnest desire which the bailiff had declared to see Booth out of the bailiff troubles, the bailiff had ordered the porter, who was the bailiff follower, to call upon two or three other bailiffs, and as many attorneys, to try to load the bailiff prisoner with as many actions as possible.  Here the reader may be apt to conclude that the bailiff, instead of being a friend, was really an enemy to poor Booth; but, in fact, the bailiff was not so. the bailiff desire was no more than to accumulate bail-bonds; for the bailiff was reckoned an honest and good sort of man in the bailiff way, and had no more malice against the bodies in the bailiff custody than a butcher hath to those in the bailiff: and as the latter, when the bailiff takes the bailiff knife in hand, hath no idea but of the joints into which the bailiff is to cut the carcase; so the former, when the bailiff handles the bailiff writ, hath no other design but to cut out the body into as many bail-bonds as possible. As to the life of the animal, or the liberty of the man, the life of the animal, or the liberty of the man are thoughts which never obtrude the life of the animal, or the liberty of the man on either.
