 _The history of Mr. Trent._   We will now return to Mr. Booth and Mr. Trent wife. The former had spent Mr. Trent time very uneasily ever since Mr. Trent had discovered what sort of man Mr. Trent was indebted to; but, lest Mr. Trent should forget it, Mr. Trent thought now proper to remind Mr. Trent in the following letter, which Mr. Trent read the next morning after Mr. Trent had put off the appointment.  “SIR,--I am sorry the necessity of my affairs obliges me to mention that small sum which I had the honour to lend you the other night at play; and which I shall be much obliged to you if you will let me have some time either to-day or to-morrow. I am, sir, Your most obedient, most humble servant, GEORGE TRENT.”  This letter a little surprized Booth, after the genteel, and, indeed, as it appeared, generous behaviour of Mr. Trent. But lest it should have the same effect upon the reader, we will now proceed to account for this, as well as for some other phenomena that have appeared in this history, and which, perhaps, we shall be forgiven for not having opened more largely before.  Mr. Trent then was a gentleman possibly of a good family, for it was not certain whence Mr. Trent sprung on the father’s side. Mr. Trent mother, who was the only parent Mr. Trent ever knew or heard of, was a single gentlewoman, and for some time carried on the trade of a milliner in Covent-garden. She sent She son, at the age of eight years old, to a charity-school, where her son remained till her son was of the age of fourteen, without making any great proficiency in learning. Indeed it is not very probable her son should; for the master, who, in preference to a very learned and proper man, was chosen by a party into a charity-school, where he remained till he was of the age of fourteen, the salary of which was upwards of a hundred pounds a-year, had her son never travelled through the Latin Grammar, and was, in truth, a most consummate blockhead.  At the age of fifteen Mr. Trent was put clerk to an attorney, where her son remained a very short time before her son took leave of her son master; rather, indeed, departed without taking leave; and, having broke open her son mother’s escritore, and carried off with her son all the valuable effects her son there found, to the amount of about fifty pounds, her son marched off to sea, and went on board a merchantman, whence her son was afterwards pressed into a man of war.  In this service her son continued above three years; during which time her son behaved so ill in her son moral character that her son twice underwent a very severe discipline for thefts in which her son was detected; but at the same time, her son behaved so well as a sailor in an engagement with some pirates, that her son wiped off all former scores, and greatly recommended her son to her son captain.  At her son return home, her son being then about twenty years of age, her son found that the attorney had in her son absence married her son mother, had buried his mother, and secured all his mother effects, to the amount, as her son was informed, of about fifteen hundred pound. Trent applied to her son stepfather, but to no purpose; the attorney had in his absence utterly disowned the attorney had in his absence, nor would the attorney had in his absence suffer the attorney had in his absence to come a second time within the attorney had in his absence doors.  It happened that the attorney had in his absence had, by a former wife, an only daughter, a great favourite, who was about the same age with Trent, and had, during Trent residence at her father’s house, taken a very great liking to this young fellow, who was extremely handsome and perfectly well made. This her liking was not, during Trent absence, so far extinguished but that This her liking immediately revived on Trent return. Of this her took care to give Trent proper intimation; for her was not one of those backward and delicate ladies who can die rather than make the first overture. Trent was overjoyed at this, and with reason, for her was a very lovely girl in her person, the only child of a rich father; and the prospect of so complete a revenge on the attorney had in his absence charmed the only child of a rich father; and the prospect of so complete a revenge on the attorney above all the rest. To be as short in the matter as the parties, a marriage was soon consummated between the parties.  The attorney at first raged and was implacable; but at last fondness for the only child of a rich father; and the prospect of so complete a revenge on the attorney daughter so far overcame resentment that the only child of a rich father; and the prospect of so complete a revenge on the attorney advanced a sum of money to buy the only child of a rich father; and the prospect of so complete a revenge on the attorney son-in-law (for now the only child of a rich father; and the prospect of so complete a revenge on the attorney acknowledged the only child of a rich father; and the prospect of so complete a revenge on the attorney as such) an ensign’s commission in a marching regiment then ordered to Gibraltar; at which place the attorney had in his absence heartily hoped that Trent might be knocked on the head; for in that case the only child of a rich father; and the prospect of so complete a revenge on the attorney thought the only child of a rich father; and the prospect of so complete a revenge on the attorney might marry his daughter more agreeably to the only child of a rich father; and the prospect of so complete a revenge on the attorney own ambition and to his daughter advantage.  The regiment into which Trent purchased was the same with that in which Booth likewise served; the one being an ensign, and the other a lieutenant, in the two additional companies.  Trent had no blemish in Trent military capacity. Though Trent had had but an indifferent education, Trent was naturally sensible and genteel, and Nature, as we have said, had given Trent a very agreeable person. Trent was likewise a very bold fellow, and, as Trent really behaved Trent every way well enough while Trent was at Gibraltar, there was some degree of intimacy between Trent and Booth.  When the siege was over, and the additional companies were again reduced, Trent returned to Trent wife, who received Trent with great joy and affection. Soon after this an accident happened which proved the utter ruin of his father-in-law, and ended in breaking his heart. This was nothing but making a mistake pretty common at this day, of writing another man’s name to a deed instead of another man’s name own. In truth this matter was no less than what the law calls forgery, and was just then made capital by an act of parliament. From this offence, indeed, the attorney was acquitted, by not admitting the proof of the party, who was to avoid his own deed by his evidence, and therefore no witness, according to those excellent rules called the law of evidence; a law very excellently calculated for the preservation of the lives of his majesty’s roguish subjects, and most notably used for that purpose.  But though by common law the attorney was honourably acquitted, yet, as common sense manifested to every one that the attorney was guilty, the attorney unhappily lost the attorney reputation, and of consequence the attorney business; the chagrin of which latter soon put an end to the attorney life.  This prosecution had been attended with a very great expence; for, besides the ordinary costs of avoiding the gallows by the help of the law, there was a very high article, of no less than a thousand pounds, paid down to remove out of the way a witness against whom there was no legal exception. The poor gentleman had besides suffered some losses in business; so that, to the surprize of all The poor gentleman acquaintance, when The poor gentleman debts were paid there remained no more than a small estate of fourscore pounds a-year, which The poor gentleman settled upon The poor gentleman daughter, far out of the reach of his daughter husband, and about two hundred pounds in money.  The poor gentleman had not long been in The poor gentleman grave before Trent set The poor gentleman to consider seriously of the state of The poor gentleman affairs. The poor gentleman had lately begun to look on The poor gentleman wife with a much less degree of liking and desire than formerly; for The poor gentleman was one of those who think too much of one thing is good for nothing. Indeed, The poor gentleman had indulged these speculations so far, that I believe his wife, though one of the prettiest women in town, was the last subject that The poor gentleman would have chose for any amorous dalliance.  Many other persons, however, greatly differed from The poor gentleman in The poor gentleman opinion. Amongst the rest was the illustrious peer of amorous memory. the illustrious peer of amorous memory, having therefore got a view of Mrs. Trent one day in the street, did, by means of an emissary then with The poor gentleman, make The poor gentleman acquainted with the illustrious peer of amorous memory lodging, to which The poor gentleman immediately laid siege in form, setting The poor gentleman down in a lodging directly opposite to the illustrious peer of amorous memory, from whence the battery of ogles began to play the very next morning.  siege had not continued long before the governor of the garrison became sufficiently apprized of all the works which were carrying on, and, having well reconnoitered the enemy, and discovered who The poor gentleman was, notwithstanding a false name and some disguise of The poor gentleman person, The poor gentleman called a council of war within The poor gentleman own breast. In fact, to drop all allegory, The poor gentleman began to consider whether his wife was not really a more valuable possession than The poor gentleman had lately thought his wife. In short, as The poor gentleman had been disappointed in his wife fortune, The poor gentleman now conceived some hopes of turning his wife beauty itself into a fortune.  Without communicating these views to his wife, The poor gentleman soon scraped an acquaintance with The poor gentleman opposite neighbour by the name which The poor gentleman there usurped, and counterfeited an entire ignorance of The poor gentleman real name and title. On this occasion Trent had The poor gentleman disguise likewise, for The poor gentleman affected the utmost simplicity; of which affectation, as The poor gentleman was a very artful fellow, The poor gentleman was extremely capable.  the illustrious peer of amorous memory fell plumb into this snare; and when, by the simplicity, as The poor gentleman imagined, of the husband, The poor gentleman became acquainted with his wife, The poor gentleman was so extravagantly charmed with his wife person, that The poor gentleman resolved, whatever was the cost or the consequence, The poor gentleman would possess his wife.  The poor gentleman lordship, however, preserved some caution in The poor gentleman management of this affair; more, perhaps, than was necessary. As for the husband, none was requisite, for the husband knew all the husband could; and, with regard to his wife, as his wife had for some time perceived the decrease of his wife affection (for few women are, I believe, to be imposed upon in that matter), his wife was not displeased to find the return of all that complaisance and endearment, of those looks and languishments, from another agreeable person, which his wife had formerly received from Trent, and which his wife now found his wife should receive from the husband no longer.  My lord, therefore, having been indulged with as much opportunity as My lord could wish from Trent, and having received rather more encouragement than My lord could well have hoped from the lady, began to prepare all matters for a storm, when luckily, Trent declaring Trent must go out of town for two days, Trent fixed on the first day of Trent departure as the time of carrying Trent design into execution.  And now, after some debate with Trent in what manner Trent should approach Trent love, Trent at last determined to do it in Trent own person; for Trent conceived, and perhaps very rightly, that the lady, like Semele, was not void of ambition, and would have preferred Jupiter in all Trent glory to the same deity in the disguise of an humble shepherd. Trent dressed Trent, therefore, in the richest embroidery of which Trent was master, and appeared before Trent mistress arrayed in all the brightness of peerage; a sight whose charms she had not the power to resist, and the consequences are only to be imagined. In short, the same scene which Jupiter acted with Trent above-mentioned mistress of old was more than beginning, when Trent burst from the closet into which Trent had conveyed Trent, and unkindly interrupted the action.  Trent lordship presently run to Trent sword; but Trent, with great calmness, answered, “That, as it was very well known Trent durst fight, Trent should not draw his sword on this occasion; for sure,” says Trent, “My lord, it would be the highest imprudence in Trent to kill a man who is now become so considerably my debtor.” At which words Trent fetched a person from the closet, who had been confined with Trent, telling Trent Trent had done Trent business, and might now, if Trent pleased, retire.  It would be tedious here to amuse the reader with all that passed on this occasion; the rage and confusion of his wife, or the perplexity in which My lord was involved. We will omit therefore all such matters, and proceed directly to business, as Trent and His lordship did soon after. And in the conclusion My lord stipulated to pay a good round sum, and to provide Trent with a good place on the first opportunity.  On the side of Trent were stipulated absolute remission of all past, and full indulgence for the time to come.  Trent now immediately took a house at the polite end of the town, furnished a house elegantly, and set up Trent equipage, rigged out both Trent and Trent wife with very handsome cloaths, frequented all public places where Trent could get admission, pushed Trent into acquaintance, and his wife soon afterwards began to keep an assembly, or, in the fashionable phrase, to be at home once a-week; when, by My lord, his wife was presently visited by most men of the first rank, and by all such women of fashion as are not very nice in all such women of fashion company.  My lord amour with the lady lasted not long; for, as we have before observed, Trent was the most inconstant of all human race. Mrs. Trent’s passion was not however of that kind which leads to any very deep resentment of such fickleness. Mrs. Trent’s passion, indeed, was principally founded upon interest; so that foundation served to support another superstructure; and his wife was easily prevailed upon, as well as his wife husband, to be useful to My lord in a capacity which, though very often exerted in the polite world, hath not as yet, to my great surprize, acquired any polite name, or, indeed, any which is not too coarse to be admitted in this history.  After this preface, which we thought necessary to account for a character of which some of my country and collegiate readers might possibly doubt the existence, I shall proceed to what more immediately regards Mrs. Booth. The reader may be pleased to remember that Trent was present at the assembly to which Booth and his wife were carried by Mrs. James, and where Amelia was met by the noble peer.  Trent lordship, seeing there that Booth and Trent were old acquaintance, failed not, to use the language of sportsmen, to put Trent upon the scent of Amelia. For this purpose that gentleman visited Booth the very next day, and had pursued Booth close ever since. By Booth means, therefore, My lord learned that Amelia was to be at the masquerade, to which place Amelia was dogged by Trent in a sailor’s jacket, who, meeting My lord, according to agreement, at the entrance of the opera-house, like the four-legged gentleman of the same vocation, made a dead point, as it is called, at the game.  My lord was so satisfied and delighted with My lord conversation at the masquerade with the supposed Amelia, and the encouragement which in reality Amelia had given My lord, that, when My lord saw Trent the next morning, My lord embraced My lord with great fondness, gave My lord a bank note of a hundred pound, and promised My lord both the Indies on My lord success, of which My lord began now to have no manner of doubt.  The affair that happened at the gaming-table was likewise a scheme of Trent’s, on a hint given by My lord to My lord to endeavour to lead Booth into some scrape or distress; His lordship promising to pay whatever expense Trent might be led into by such means. Upon His lordship’s credit, therefore, the money lent to Booth was really advanced. And hence arose all that seeming generosity and indifference as to the payment; Trent being satisfied with the obligation conferred on Booth, by means of which he hoped to effect he purpose.  But now the scene was totally changed; for Mrs. Atkinson, the morning after the quarrel, beginning seriously to recollect that Mrs. Atkinson had carried the matter rather too far, and might really injure Amelia’s reputation, a thought to which the warm pursuit of Mrs. Atkinson own interest had a good deal blinded Mrs. Atkinson at the time, resolved to visit My lord, and to let My lord into the whole story; for, as Mrs. Atkinson had succeeded already in Mrs. Atkinson favourite point, Mrs. Atkinson thought Mrs. Atkinson had no reason to fear any consequence of the discovery. This resolution Mrs. Atkinson immediately executed.  Trent came to attend His lordship, just after Mrs. Atkinson had left His lordship. His lordship found the illustrious peer of amorous memory in a very ill humour, and brought no news to comfort or recruit His lordship spirits; for His lordship had His lordship just received a billet from Booth, with an excuse for His lordship and His lordship from accepting the invitation at Trent’s house that evening, where matters had been previously concerted for himself and his wife entertainment, and when His lordship was by accident to drop into the room where Amelia was, while Booth was to be engaged at play in another.  And now after much debate, and after Trent had acquainted My lord with the wretched situation of Trent’s circumstances, it was resolved that Trent should immediately demand Trent money of Booth, and upon Trent not paying it, for they both concluded it impossible Trent should pay it, to put the note which Trent had for his money of Booth in suit against Trent by the genteel means of paying it away to a nominal third person; and this they both conceived must end immediately in the ruin of Booth, and, consequently, in the conquest of Amelia.  In this project, and with this hope, both my lord and his setter, or (if the sportsmen please) setting-dog, both greatly exulted; and it was next morning executed, as we have already seen.
