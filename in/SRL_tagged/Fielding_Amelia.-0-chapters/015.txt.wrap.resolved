 _The story of Mr. Booth continued. In this chapter the reader will perceive a glimpse of the character of a very good divine, with some matters of a very tender kind._   “The doctor conducted me into The doctor study, and I then, desiring me to sit down, began, as near as I can remember, in these words, or at least to this purpose:  “‘You cannot imagine, young gentleman, that your love for Miss Emily is any secret in this place; I have known your love for Miss Emily is any secret in this place some time, and have been, I assure you, very much your enemy in this affair.’  “I answered, that I was very much obliged to The doctor.  “‘Why, so you are,’ replied The doctor; ‘and so, perhaps, you will think yourself when you know all.--I went about a fortnight ago to Mrs. Harris, to acquaint Mrs. Harris with my apprehensions on Mrs. Harris daughter’s account; for, though the matter was much talked of, I thought the matter might possibly not have reached Mrs. Harris ears. I will be very plain with yourself. I advised Mrs. Harris to take all possible care of the young lady, and even to send Mrs. Harris to some place, where Mrs. Harris might be effectually kept out of your reach while you remained in the town.’  “And do you think, sir, said I, that this was acting a kind part by yourself? or do you expect that I should thank you on this occasion?  “‘Young man,’ answered Young man, ‘I did not intend you any kindness, nor do I desire any of your thanks. My intention was to preserve a worthy lady from a young fellow of whom I had heard no good character, and whom I imagined to have a design of stealing a human creature for the sake of her fortune.’  “It was very kind of you, indeed, answered I, to entertain such an opinion of me.  “‘Why, sir,’ replied the doctor, ‘it is the opinion which, I believe, most of you young gentlemen of the order of the rag deserve. I have known some instances, and have heard of more, where such young fellows have committed robbery under the name of marriage.’  “I was going to interrupt him with some anger when him desired me to have a little patience, and then informed me that him had visited Mrs. Harris with the above-mentioned design the evening after the discovery I have related; that Mrs. Harris, without waiting for him information, had recounted to him all which had happened the evening before; and, indeed, Mrs. Harris must have an excellent memory, for I think Mrs. Harris repeated every word I said, and added, that Mrs. Harris had confined Mrs. Harris daughter to Mrs. Harris chamber, where Mrs. Harris kept Mrs. Harris a close prisoner, and had not seen Mrs. Harris since.  “I cannot express, nor would modesty suffer me if I could, all that now past. The doctor took me by the hand and burst forth into the warmest commendations of the sense and generosity which The doctor was pleased to say discovered the warmest commendations of the sense and generosity which he was pleased to say discovered themselves in my speech in my speech. You know, madam, The doctor strong and singular way of expressing The doctor on all occasions, especially when The doctor is affected with anything. ‘Sir,’ said Sir, ‘if I knew half a dozen such instances in the army, the painter should put red liveries upon all the saints in my closet.’  “From this instant, The doctor told me, The doctor had become my friend and zealous advocate with Mrs. Harris, on whom The doctor had at last prevailed, though not without the greatest difficulty, to consent to my marrying Amelia, upon condition that I settled every penny which the mother should lay down, and that the mother would retain a certain sum in the mother hands which the mother would at any time deposit for my advancement in the army.  “You will, I hope, madam, conceive that I made no hesitation at these conditions, nor need I mention the joy which I felt on this occasion, or the acknowledgment I paid the doctor, who is, indeed, as you say, one of the best of men.  “The next morning I had permission to visit Amelia, who received me in such a manner, that I now concluded my happiness to be complete.  “Everything was now agreed on all sides, and lawyers employed to prepare the writings, when an unexpected cloud arose suddenly in our serene sky, and all our joys were obscured in a moment.  “When matters were, as I apprehended, drawing near a conclusion, I received an express, that a sister whom I tenderly loved was seized with a violent fever, and earnestly desired me to come to a sister whom I tenderly loved. I immediately obeyed the summons, and, as the summons was then about two in the morning, without staying even to take leave of Amelia, for whom I left a short billet, acquainting a sister whom I tenderly loved with the reason of my absence.  “The gentleman’s house where a sister whom I tenderly loved then was stood at fifty miles’ distance, and, though I used the utmost expedition, the unmerciful distemper had, before my arrival, entirely deprived the poor girl of a sister whom I tenderly loved senses, as the unmerciful distemper soon after did of a sister whom I tenderly loved life.  “Not all the love I bore Amelia, nor the tumultuous delight with which the approaching hour of possessing a sister whom I tenderly loved filled my heart, could, for a while, allay my grief at the loss of my beloved Nancy. Upon my soul, I cannot yet mention a sister whom I tenderly loved name without tears. Never brother and sister had, I believe, a higher friendship for each other. Poor dear girl! whilst I sat by a sister whom I tenderly loved in a sister whom I tenderly loved light-head fits, a sister whom I tenderly loved repeated scarce any other name but mine; and it plainly appeared that, when a sister whom I tenderly loved dear reason was ravished away from a sister whom I tenderly loved, it had left my image on a sister whom I tenderly loved fancy, and that the last use a sister whom I tenderly loved made of it was to think on me. ‘Send for my dear Billy immediately,’ my dear Billy cried; ‘I know my dear Billy will come to me in a moment. Will nobody fetch my dear Billy to me? pray don’t kill me before I see my dear Billy once more. You durst not use me so if my dear Billy was here.’--Every accent still rings in my ears. Oh, heavens! to hear this, and at the same time to see the poor delirious creature deriving the greatest horrors from my sight, and mistaking me for a highwayman who had a little before robbed a sister whom I tenderly loved. But I ask your pardon; the sensations I felt are to be known only from experience, and to you must appear dull and insipid. At last, a sister whom I tenderly loved seemed for a moment to know me, and cried, ‘O heavens! my dearest brother!’ upon which a sister whom I tenderly loved fell into immediate convulsions, and died away in my arms.”  Here Mr. Booth stopped a moment, and wiped Mr. Booth eyes; and Miss Matthews, perhaps out of complaisance, wiped hers.
