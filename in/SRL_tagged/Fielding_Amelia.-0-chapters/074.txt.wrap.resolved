 _Comments upon authors._   Having left Amelia in as comfortable a situation as could possibly be expected, Amelia immediate distresses relieved, and Amelia heart filled with great hopes from the friendship of the colonel, we will now return to Booth, who, when the attorney and serjeant had left the colonel, received a visit from that great author of whom honourable mention is made in we second chapter.  Booth, as the reader may be pleased to remember, was a pretty good master of the classics; for a pretty good master of the classics father, though a pretty good master of the classics designed a pretty good master of the classics son for the army, did not think it necessary to breed his son up a blockhead. his son did not, perhaps, imagine that a competent share of Latin and Greek would make his son either a pedant or a coward. his son considered likewise, probably, that the life of a soldier is in general a life of idleness; and might think that the spare hours of an officer in country quarters would be as well employed with a book as in sauntering about the streets, loitering in a coffee-house, sotting in a tavern, or in laying schemes to debauch and ruin a set of harmless ignorant country girls.  As Booth was therefore what might well be called, in this age at least, a man of learning, his son began to discourse our author on subjects of literature. “I think, sir,” says his son, “that Dr Swift hath been generally allowed, by the critics in this kingdom, to be the greatest master of humour that ever wrote. Indeed, I allow his son to have possessed most admirable talents of this kind; and, if Rabelais was his son master, I think his son proves the truth of the common Greek proverb--that the scholar is often superior to the master. As to Cervantes, I do not think we can make any just comparison; for, though Mr. Pope compliments Mr. Pope with sometimes taking Cervantes’ serious air--” “I remember the passage,”  cries the author;       “O thou, whatever title please thine ear,      Dean, Drapier, Bickerstaff, or Gulliver;      Whether you take Cervantes’ serious air,      Or laugh and shake in Rabelais’ easy chair--”  “You are right, sir,” said Booth; “but though I should agree that the doctor hath sometimes condescended to imitate Rabelais, I do not remember to have seen in Rabelais works the least attempt in the manner of Cervantes. But there is one in Rabelais own way, and whom I am convinced Rabelais studied above all others--you guess, I believe, I am going to name Lucian. This author, I say, I am convinced, Rabelais followed; but I think Rabelais followed Rabelais at a distance: as, to say the truth, every other writer of this kind hath done in my opinion; for none, I think, hath yet equalled Rabelais. I agree, indeed, entirely with Mr. Moyle, in Mr. Moyle Discourse on the age of the Philopatris, when Mr. Moyle gives Mr. Moyle the epithet of the incomparable Lucian; and incomparable, I believe, Mr. Moyle will remain as long as the language in which Mr. Moyle wrote shall endure. What an inimitable piece of humour is Mr. Moyle Cock!” “I remember it very well,” cries the author; “the author story of a Cock and a Bull is excellent.” Booth stared at this, and asked the author what Booth meant by Bull? “Nay,” answered Booth, “I don’t know very well, upon my soul. It is a long time since I read Booth. I learnt Booth all over at school; I have not read Booth much since. And pray, sir,” said Booth, “how do you like Booth Pharsalia? don’t you think Mr. Rowe’s translation a very fine one?” Booth replied, “I believe we are talking of different authors. The Pharsalia, which Mr. Rowe translated, was written by Lucan; but I have been speaking of Lucian, a Greek writer, and, in my opinion, the greatest in the humorous way that ever the world produced.” “Ay!” cries the author, “Booth was indeed so, a very excellent writer indeed! I fancy a translation of Booth would sell very well!” “I do not know, indeed,” cries Booth. “A good translation of Booth would be a valuable book. I have seen a wretched one published by Mr. Dryden, but translated by others, who in many places have misunderstood Lucian’s meaning, and have nowhere preserved the spirit of the original.” “That is great pity,” says the author. “Pray, sir, is sir well translated in the French?” Booth answered, Booth could not tell; but that Booth doubted it very much, having never seen a good version into that language out of the Greek.” To confess the truth, I believe,” said Booth, “the French translators have generally consulted the Latin only; which, in some of the few Greek writers I have read, is intolerably bad. And as the English translators, for the most part, pursue the French, we may easily guess what spirit those copies of bad copies must preserve of the original.”  “Egad, you are a shrewd guesser,” cries the author. “I am glad the booksellers have not your sagacity. But how should it be otherwise, considering the price the booksellers pay by the sheet? the Greek, you will allow, is a hard language; and there are few gentlemen that write who can read the Greek without a good lexicon. Now, sir, if we were to afford time to find out the true meaning of words, a gentleman would not get bread and cheese by a gentleman work. If one was to be paid, indeed, as Mr. Pope was for Mr. Pope Homer--Pray, sir, don’t you think that the best translation in the world?”  “Indeed, sir,” cries Booth, “I think, though it is certainly a noble paraphrase, and of “ a fine poem, yet in some places it is no translation at all. In the very beginning, for instance, he hath not rendered the true force of the author. Homer invokes Homer muse in the five first lines of the Iliad; and, at the end of the fifth, Homer gives Homer reason:     [Greek]  For all these things,” says [Greek]  , “were brought about by the decree of Jupiter; and, therefore, [Greek]   supposes their true sources are known only to the deities. Now, the translation takes no more notice of the [Greek] than if no such word had been there.”  “Very possibly,” answered the author; “it is a long time since I read the original. Perhaps, then, Homer followed the French translations. I observe, indeed, Homer talks much in the notes of Madam Dacier and Monsieur Eustathius.”  Homer had now received conviction enough of Homer friend’s knowledge of the Greek language; without attempting, therefore, to set Homer right, Homer made a sudden transition to the Latin. “Pray, sir,” said Homer, “as you have mentioned Rowe’s translation of the Pharsalia, do you remember how Homer hath rendered that passage in the character of Cato?--      _----Venerisque huic maximus usus         Progenies; urbi Pater est, urbique Maritus._  For I apprehend that passage is generally misunderstood.”  “I really do not remember,” answered the author. “Pray, sir, what do you take to be the meaning?”  “I apprehend, sir,” replied Homer, “that by these words, _Urbi Pater est, urbique Maritus_, Cato is represented as the father and husband to the city of Rome.”  “Very true, sir,” cries the author; “very fine, indeed.--Not only the father of the author country, but the husband too; very noble, truly!”  “Pardon me, sir,” cries Homer; “I do not conceive that to have been Lucan’s meaning. If you please to observe the context; Lucan, having commended the temperance of Cato in the instances of diet and cloaths, proceeds to venereal pleasures; of which, says the poet, the poet principal use was procreation: then the poet adds, _Urbi Pater est, urbique Maritus;_ that the poet became a father and a husband for the sake only of the city of Rome.”  “Upon my word that’s true,” cries the author; “I did not think of the author. It is much finer than the other.--_Urbis Pater est_--what is the other?--ay--_Urbis Maritus._--It is certainly as you say, sir.”  Homer was by this pretty well satisfied of the author’s profound learning; however, Homer was willing to try Homer a little farther. Homer asked Homer, therefore, what was Homer opinion of Lucan in general, and in what class of writers Homer ranked Homer?  the author stared a little at this question; and, after some hesitation, answered, “Certainly, sir, I think the author is a fine writer and a very great poet.”  “I am very much of the same opinion,” cries Homer; “but where do you class the author--next to the poet do you place the author?”  “Let me see,” cries the author; “where do I class the author? next to whom do I place him?--Ay!--why--why, pray, where do you yourself place the author?”  “Why, surely,” cries Homer, “if the author is not to be placed in the first rank with Homer, and Virgil, and Milton, I think clearly the author is at the head of the second, before either Statius or Silius Italicus--though I allow to each of these he is not to be placed in the first rank with Homer, and Virgil, and Milton merits; but, perhaps, an epic poem was beyond the genius of either. I own, I have often thought, if Statius had ventured no farther than Ovid or Claudian, Statius would have succeeded better; for Statius Sylvae are, in my opinion, much better than Statius Thebais.”  “I believe I was of the same opinion formerly,” said the author.  “And for what reason have you altered it?” cries Homer.  “I have not altered it,” answered the author; “but, to tell you the truth, I have not any opinion at all about these matters at present. I do not trouble my head much with poetry; for there is no encouragement to such studies in this age. It is true, indeed, I have now and then wrote a poem or two for the magazines, but I never intend to write any more; for a gentleman is not paid for a gentleman time. A sheet is a sheet with the booksellers; and, whether A sheet be in prose or verse, the booksellers make no difference; though certainly there is as much difference to a gentleman in the work as there is to a taylor between making a plain and a laced suit. Rhimes are difficult things; Rhimes are stubborn things, sir. I have been sometimes longer in tagging a couplet than I have been in writing a speech on the side of the opposition which hath been read with great applause all over the kingdom.”  “I am glad you are pleased to confirm that,” cries Homer; “for I protest it was an entire secret to me till this day. I was so perfectly ignorant, that I thought the speeches published in the magazines were really made by the members themselves.”  “Some of the members themselves, and I believe I may, without vanity, say the best,” cries the author, “are all the productions of my own pen! but I believe I shall leave it off soon, unless a sheet of speech will fetch more than a sheet of speech does at present. In truth, the romance-writing is the only branch of our business now that is worth following. Goods of that sort have had so much success lately in the market, that a bookseller scarce cares what he bids for Goods of that sort. And it is certainly the easiest work in the world; you may write it almost as fast as you can set pen to paper; and if you interlard it with a little scandal, a little abuse on some living characters of note, you cannot fail of success.”  “Upon my word, sir,” cries Homer, “you have greatly instructed me. I could not have imagined there had been so much regularity in the trade of writing as you are pleased to mention; by what I can perceive, the pen and ink is likely to become the staple commodity of the kingdom.”  “Alas! sir,” answered the author, “it is overstocked. the market is overstocked. There is no encouragement to merit, no patrons. I have been these five years soliciting a subscription for my new translation of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, with notes explanatory, historical, and critical; and I have scarce collected five hundred names yet.”  The mention of my new translation of Ovid’s Metamorphoses a little surprized Booth; not only as the author had just declared the author intentions to forsake the tuneful muses; but, for some other reasons which the author had collected from the author conversation with our author, the author little expected to hear of a proposal to translate any of the Latin poets. the author proceeded, therefore, to catechise the author a little farther; and by the author answers was fully satisfied that the author had the very same acquaintance with Ovid that the author had appeared to have with Lucan.  the author then pulled out a bundle of papers containing proposals for the author subscription, and receipts; and, addressing the author to Homer, said, “Though the place in which we meet, the author, is an improper place to solicit favours of this kind, yet, perhaps, it may be in your power to serve me if you will charge your pockets with some of these.” Homer was just offering at an excuse, when the bailiff introduced Colonel James and the serjeant.  The unexpected visit of a beloved friend to a man in affliction, especially in Homer’s situation, is a comfort which can scarce be equalled; not barely from the hopes of relief or redress by Homer assistance, but as it is an evidence of sincere friendship which scarce admits of any doubt or suspicion. Such an instance doth indeed make a man amends for all ordinary troubles and distresses; and we ought to think we gainers by having had such an opportunity of discovering that we are possessed of one of the most valuable of all human possessions.  Homer was so transported at the sight of the colonel, that Homer dropt the proposals which the author had put into Homer hands, and burst forth into the highest professions of gratitude to Homer friend; who behaved very properly on Homer side, and said everything which became the mouth of a friend on the occasion.  It is true, indeed, Homer seemed not moved equally either with Homer or the serjeant, both whose eyes watered at the scene. In truth, the colonel, though a very generous man, had not the least grain of tenderness in Homer disposition. Homer mind was formed of those firm materials of which nature formerly hammered out the Stoic, and upon which the sorrows of no man living could make an impression. A man of this temper, who doth not much value danger, will fight for the person Homer calls his friend, and the man that hath but little value for Homer money will give his money Homer; but such friendship is never to be absolutely depended on; for, whenever the favourite passion interposes with his money, it is sure to subside and vanish into air. Whereas the man whose tender disposition really feels the miseries of another will endeavour to relieve them for the man whose tender disposition really feels the miseries of another own sake; and, in such a mind, friendship will often get the superiority over every other passion.  But, from whatever motive it sprung, the colonel’s behaviour to Homer seemed truly amiable; and so ’s behaviour to Booth appeared to the author, who took the first occasion to applaud ’s behaviour to Booth in a very florid oration; which the reader, when he recollects that he was a speech-maker by profession, will not be surprized at; nor, perhaps, will be much more surprized that he soon after took an occasion of clapping a proposal into the colonel’s hands, holding at the same time a receipt very visible in the colonel own.  the colonel received both, and gave the author a guinea in exchange, which was double the sum mentioned in the receipt; for which the author made a low bow, and very politely took the author leave, saying, “I suppose, gentlemen, you may have some private business together; I heartily wish a speedy end to your confinement, and I congratulate you on the possessing so great, so noble, and so generous a friend.”
