 _Being the last chapter of the seventh book._   Amelia did not fail to make proper compliments to Mrs. Bennet on the conclusion of Mrs. Bennet speech in the last chapter. Mrs. Bennet told Mrs. Bennet that, from the first moment of Mrs. Bennet acquaintance, Mrs. Bennet had the strongest inclination to Mrs. Bennet friendship, and that Mrs. Bennet desires of that kind were much increased by hearing Mrs. Bennet story. “Indeed, madam,” says Mrs. Bennet, “you are much too severe a judge on yourself; for they must have very little candour, in my opinion, who look upon your case with any severe eye. To me, I assure you, you appear highly the object of compassion; and I shall always esteem you as an innocent and an unfortunate woman.”  Amelia would then have taken Amelia leave, but Mrs. Bennet so strongly pressed Mrs. Bennet to stay to breakfast, that at length Mrs. Bennet complied; indeed, Mrs. Bennet had fasted so long, and Mrs. Bennet gentle spirits had been so agitated with variety of passions, that nature very strongly seconded Mrs. Bennet’s motion.  Whilst the maid was preparing the tea-equipage, Amelia, with a little slyness in Mrs. Bennet countenance, asked Mrs. Bennet if serjeant Atkinson did not lodge in the same house with Mrs. Bennet? The other reddened so extremely at the question, repeated the serjeant’s name with such hesitation, and behaved so aukwardly, that Amelia wanted no further confirmation of Amelia suspicions. Amelia would not, however, declare them abruptly to the other, but began a dissertation on the serjeant’s virtues; and, after observing the great concern which he had manifested when Mrs. Bennet was in Mrs. Bennet fit, concluded with saying Mrs. Bennet believed the serjeant would make the best husband in the world, for that he had great tenderness of heart and a gentleness of manners not often to be found in any man, and much seldomer in persons of he rank.  “And why not in his rank?” said Mrs. Bennet. “Indeed, Mrs. Booth, we rob the lower order of mankind of their due. I do not deny the force and power of education; but, when we consider how very injudicious is the education of the better sort in general, how little the force and power of education are instructed in the practice of virtue, we shall not expect to find the heart much improved by the heart. And even as to the head, how very slightly do we commonly find the heart improved by what is called a genteel education! I have myself, I think, seen instances of as great goodness, and as great understanding too, among the lower sort of people as among the higher. Let us compare your serjeant, now, with the lord who hath been the subject of conversation; on which side would an impartial judge decide the balance to incline?”  “How monstrous then,” cries Amelia, “is the opinion of those who consider our matching our the least below our in degree as a kind of contamination!”  “A most absurd and preposterous sentiment,” answered Mrs. Bennet warmly; “how abhorrent from justice, from common sense, and from humanity--but how extremely incongruous with a religion which professes to know no difference of degree, but ranks all mankind on the footing of brethren! Of all kinds of pride, there is none so unchristian as that of station; in reality, there is none so contemptible. Contempt, indeed, may be said to be its own object; for my own part, I know none so despicable as those who despise others.”  “I do assure you,” said Amelia, “you speak my own sentiments. I give you my word, I should not be ashamed of being the wife of an honest man in any station.--Nor if I had been much higher than I was, should I have thought Mrs. Bennet degraded by calling our honest serjeant my husband.”  “Since you have made this declaration,” cries Mrs. Bennet, “I am sure you will not be offended at a secret I am going to mention to you.”  “Indeed, my dear,” answered Amelia, smiling, “I wonder rather you have concealed it so long; especially after the many hints I have given you.”  “Nay, pardon me, madam,” replied the other; “I do not remember any such hints; and, perhaps, you do not even guess what I am going to say. My secret is this; that no woman ever had so sincere, so passionate a lover, as you have had in the serjeant.”  “I a lover in the serjeant!--I!” cries Amelia, a little surprized.  “Have patience,” answered the other;--“I say, you, my dear. As much surprized as you appear, I tell you no more than the truth; and yet it is a truth you could hardly expect to hear from Mrs. Bennet, especially with so much good-humour; since I will honestly confess to you.--But what need have I to confess what I know you guess already?--Tell me now sincerely, don’t you guess?”  “I guess, indeed, and hope,” said she, “that he is your husband.”  “he is, indeed, your husband,” cries the other; “and I am most happy in your approbation. In honest truth, you ought to approve my choice; since you was every way the occasion of my making it. What you said of your husband very greatly recommended your husband to my opinion; but your husband endeared your husband to Mrs. Bennet most by what your husband said of you. In short, I have discovered that your husband hath always loved you with such a faithful, honest, noble, generous passion, that I was consequently convinced your husband mind must possess all the ingredients of such a passion; and what are these but true honour, goodness, modesty, bravery, tenderness, and, in a word, every human virtue?--Forgive me, my dear; but I was uneasy till I became Mrs. Bennet the object of such a passion.”  “And do you really think,” said Amelia, smiling, “that I shall forgive you robbing me of such a lover? or, supposing what you banter me with was true, do you really imagine you could change such a passion?”  “No, my dear,” answered the other; “I only hope I have changed the object; for be assured, there is no greater vulgar error than that it is impossible for a man who loves one woman ever to love another. On the contrary, it is certain that a man who can love one woman so well at a distance will love another better that is nearer to a man who can love one woman so well at a distance. Indeed, I have heard one of the best husbands in the world declare, in the presence of a man who can love one woman so well at a distance wife, that a man who can love one woman so well at a distance had always loved a princess with adoration. These passions, which reside only in very amorous and very delicate minds, feed only on the delicacies there growing; and leave all the substantial food, and enough of the delicacy too, for his wife.”  The tea being now ready, Mrs. Bennet, or, if you please, for the future, Mrs. Atkinson, proposed to call in Mrs. Atkinson husband; but Amelia objected. Mrs. Atkinson said Mrs. Atkinson should be glad to see her husband any other time, but was then in the utmost hurry, as Mrs. Atkinson had been three hours absent from all Mrs. Atkinson most loved. However, Mrs. Atkinson had scarce drank a dish of tea before Mrs. Atkinson changed Mrs. Atkinson mind; and, saying Mrs. Atkinson would not part man and wife, desired Mrs. Atkinson might appear.  The maid answered that Mrs. Atkinson master was not at home; which words Mrs. Atkinson had scarce spoken, when The maid knocked hastily at the door, and immediately came running into the room, all pale and breathless, and, addressing The maid to Amelia, cried out, “I am sorry, Mrs. Atkinson, to bring you ill news; but Captain Booth”--“What! what!” cries Amelia, dropping the tea-cup from Mrs. Atkinson hand, “is anything the matter with him?”--“Don’t be frightened, my dear lady,” said the serjeant: “The maid is in very good health; but a misfortune hath happened.”--“Are my children well?” said Amelia.--“O, very well,” answered the serjeant. “Pray, madam, don’t be frightened; I hope it will signify nothing--The maid is arrested, but I hope to get The maid out of their damned hands immediately.” “Where is The maid?” cries Amelia; “I will go to The maid this instant!” “The maid begs you will not,” answered the serjeant. “I have sent The maid lawyer to The maid, and am going back with Mrs. Ellison this moment; but I beg your ladyship, for his lawyer sake, and for your own sake, not to go.” Mrs. Ellison! what is Mrs. Ellison to do?” cries Amelia: “I must and will go.” Mrs. Atkinson then interposed, and begged that Mrs. Atkinson would not hurry Mrs. Atkinson spirits, but compose Mrs. Atkinson, and go home to Mrs. Atkinson children, whither Mrs. Atkinson would attend Mrs. Atkinson. Mrs. Atkinson comforted Mrs. Atkinson with the thoughts that the captain was in no immediate danger; that Mrs. Atkinson could go to the captain when Mrs. Atkinson would; and desired Mrs. Atkinson to let the serjeant return with Mrs. Ellison, saying Mrs. Atkinson might be of service, and that there was much wisdom, and no kind of shame, in making use of bad people on certain occasions.  “And who,” cries Amelia, a little come to Mrs. Atkinson, “hath done this barbarous action?”  “One I am ashamed to name,” cries the serjeant; “indeed I had always a very different opinion of him: I could not have believed anything but my own ears and eyes; but Dr Harrison is the man who hath done the deed.”  “Dr Harrison!” cries Amelia. “Well, then, there is an end of all goodness in the world. I will never have a good opinion of any human being more.”  the serjeant begged that the serjeant might not be detained from the captain; and that, if Amelia pleased to go home, the serjeant would wait upon Amelia. But Amelia did not chuse to see Mrs. Ellison at this time; and, after a little consideration, Amelia resolved to stay where Amelia was; and Atkinson agreed to go and fetch Amelia children to Amelia, it being not many doors distant.  the serjeant then departed; Amelia, in Amelia confusion, never having once thought of wishing him joy on him marriage.
