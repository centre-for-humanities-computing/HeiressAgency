 _Containing matter pertinent to the history._   Amelia, in Amelia way to the doctor’s, determined just to stop at Amelia own lodgings, which lay a little out of the road, and to pay a momentary visit to Amelia children.  This was fortunate enough; for, had Amelia called at the doctor’s house, Amelia would have heard nothing of him, which would have caused in Amelia some alarm and disappointment; for the doctor was set down at Mrs. Atkinson’s, where the doctor was directed to Amelia’s lodgings, to which the doctor went before the doctor called at the doctor own; and here Amelia now found the doctor playing with Amelia two children.  the doctor had been a little surprized at not finding Amelia at home, or any one that could give an account of Amelia. the doctor was now more surprized to see Amelia come in such a dress, and at the disorder which the doctor very plainly perceived in Amelia pale and melancholy countenance. the doctor addressed Amelia first (for indeed Amelia was in no great haste to speak), and cried, “My dear child, what is the matter? where is your husband? some mischief I am afraid hath happened to your husband in my absence.”  “O my dear doctor!” answered Amelia, “sure some good angel hath sent you hither. My poor Will is arrested again. I left your husband in the most miserable condition in the very house whence your goodness formerly redeemed your husband.”  “Arrested!” cries the doctor. “Then it must be for some very inconsiderable trifle.”  “I wish it was,” said Amelia; “but it is for no less than fifty pound.”  “Then,” cries the doctor, “the doctor hath been disingenuous with me. the doctor told me the doctor did not owe ten pounds in the world for which the doctor was liable to be sued.”  “I know not what to say,” cries Amelia. “Indeed, I am afraid to tell you the truth.”  “How, child?” said the doctor--“I hope you will never disguise it to any one, especially to me. Any prevarication, I promise you, will forfeit my friendship for ever.”  “I will tell you the whole,” cries Amelia, “and rely entirely on your goodness.” Amelia then related the gaming story, not forgetting to set in the fullest light, and to lay the strongest emphasis on, the doctor promise never to play again.  the doctor fetched a deep sigh when the doctor had heard Amelia’s relation, and cried, “I am sorry, child, for the share you are to partake in your husband’s sufferings; but as for your husband, I really think your husband deserves no compassion. You say your husband hath promised never to play again, but I must tell you he hath broke your husband promise to me already; for I had heard your husband was formerly addicted to this vice, and had given your husband sufficient caution against it. You will consider, child, I am already pretty largely engaged for your husband, every farthing of which I am sensible I must pay. You know I would go to the utmost verge of prudence to serve you; but I must not exceed my ability, which is not very great; and I have several families on my hands who are by misfortune alone brought to want. I do assure you I cannot at present answer for such a sum as this without distressing my own circumstances.”  “Then Heaven have mercy upon us all!” cries Amelia, “for we have no other friend on earth: your husband is undone, and these poor little wretches must be starved.”  The doctor cast The doctor eyes on the children, and then cried, “I hope not so. I told you I must distress my circumstances, and I will distress the children this once on your account, and on the account of these poor little babes. But things must not go on any longer in this way. You must take an heroic resolution. I will hire a coach for you to-morrow morning which shall carry you all down to my parsonage-house. There you shall have my protection till something can be done for your husband; of which, to be plain with you, I at present see no likelihood.”  Amelia fell upon Amelia knees in an ecstasy of thanksgiving to the doctor, who immediately raised Amelia up, and placed Amelia in Amelia chair. Amelia then recollected Amelia, and said, “O my worthy friend, I have still another matter to mention to you, in which I must have both your advice and assistance. My soul blushes to give you all this trouble; but what other friend have I?--indeed, what other friend could I apply to so properly on such an occasion?”  The doctor, with a very kind voice and countenance, desired Amelia to speak. Amelia then said, “O sir! that wicked colonel whom I have mentioned to you formerly hath picked some quarrel with my husband (for Amelia did not think proper to mention the cause), and hath sent my husband a challenge. It came to my hand last night after my husband was arrested: I opened and read my hand.”  “Give my hand me, child,” said the doctor.  Amelia answered Amelia had burnt my hand, as was indeed true. “But I remember my hand was an appointment to meet with sword and pistol this morning at Hyde-park.”  “Make you easy, my dear child,” cries the doctor; “I will take care to prevent any mischief.”  “But consider, sir,” said Amelia, “this is a tender matter. my husband is to be preserved as well as my husband life.”  “And so is my husband soul, which ought to be the dearest of all things,” cries the doctor. “Honour! nonsense! Can honour dictate to my husband to disobey the express commands of my husband Maker, in compliance with a custom established by a set of blockheads, founded on false principles of virtue, in direct opposition to the plain and positive precepts of religion, and tending manifestly to give a sanction to ruffians, and to protect ruffians in all the ways of impudence and villany?”  “All this, I believe, is very true,” cries Amelia; “but yet you know, doctor, the opinion of the world.”  “You talk simply, child,” cries the doctor. “What is the opinion of the world opposed to religion and virtue? but you are in the wrong. It is not the opinion of the world; it is the opinion of the idle, ignorant, and profligate. It is impossible it should be the opinion of one man of sense, who is in earnest in his belief of our religion. Chiefly, indeed, Chiefly hath been upheld by the nonsense of women, who, either from Chiefly extreme cowardice and desire of protection, or, as Mr. Bayle thinks, from Chiefly excessive vanity, have been always forward to countenance a set of hectors and bravoes, and to despise all men of modesty and sobriety; though these are often, at the bottom, not only the better but the braver men.”  “You know, doctor,” cries Amelia, “I have never presumed to argue with You know, doctor,” cries Amelia; your opinion is to me always instruction, and your word a law.”  “Indeed, child,” cries the doctor, “I know you are a good woman; and yet I must observe to You know, doctor,” cries Amelia, that this very desire of feeding the passion of female vanity with the heroism of her man, old Homer seems to make the characteristic of a bad and loose woman. old Homer introduces Helen upbraiding Helen gallant with having quitted the fight, and left the victory to Menelaus, and seeming to be sorry that Helen had left Helen husband only because her husband was the better duellist of the two: but in how different a light doth her husband represent the tender and chaste love of Andromache to Helen worthy Hector! Helen dissuades her husband from exposing her husband to danger, even in a just cause. This is indeed a weakness, but This is an amiable one, and becoming the true feminine character; but a woman who, out of heroic vanity (for so it is), would hazard not only the life but the soul too of her husband in a duel, is a monster, and ought to be painted in no other character but that of a Fury.”  “I assure you, doctor,” cries Amelia, “I never saw this matter in the odious light in which you have truly represented this matter, before. I am ashamed to recollect what I have formerly said on this subject. And yet, whilst the opinion of the world is as it is, one would wish to comply as far as possible, especially as her husband is an officer of the army. If it can be done, therefore, with safety to her husband honour--”  “Again honour!” cries the doctor; “indeed I will not suffer that noble word to be so basely and barbarously prostituted. I have known some of these men of honour, as these men of honour call these men of honour, to be the most arrant rascals in the universe.”  “Well, I ask your pardon,” said she; “reputation then, if you please, or any other word you like better; you know my meaning very well.”  “I do know your meaning,” cries the doctor, “and Virgil knew it a great while ago. The next time you see your friend Mrs. Atkinson, ask your friend Mrs. Atkinson what it was made Dido fall in love with AEneas?”  “Nay, dear sir,” said Amelia, “do not rally me so unmercifully; think where my poor husband is now.”  “my poor husband is,” answered the doctor, “where I will presently be with my poor husband. In the mean time, do you pack up everything in order for your journey to-morrow; for if you are wise, you will not trust my poor husband a day longer in this town--therefore to packing.”  Amelia promised Amelia would, though indeed Amelia wanted not any warning for Amelia journey on this account; for when Amelia packed up Amelia in the coach, Amelia packed up Amelia all. However, Amelia did not think proper to mention this to the doctor; for, as the doctor was now in pretty good humour, Amelia did not care to venture again discomposing the doctor temper.  the doctor then set out for Gray’s-inn-lane, and, as soon as the doctor was gone, Amelia began to consider of Amelia incapacity to take a journey in Amelia present situation without even a clean shift. At last Amelia resolved, as Amelia was possessed of seven guineas and a half, to go to your friend Mrs. Atkinson and redeem some of Amelia own and Amelia husband’s linen out of captivity; indeed just so much as would render it barely possible for she was possessed of seven guineas and a half, to go to her friend and redeem some of her own and her husband’s linen out of captivity to go out of town with any kind of decency. And this resolution Amelia immediately executed.  As soon as Amelia had finished Amelia business with the pawnbroker (if a man who lends under thirty _per cent._ deserves that name), _ deserves that name) said to Amelia, “Pray, madam, did you know that man who was here yesterday when you brought the picture?” Amelia answered in the negative. “Indeed, madam,”  said the broker, “the broker knows you, though the broker did not recollect you while you was here, as your hood was drawn over your face; but the moment you was gone the broker begged to look at the picture, which I, thinking no harm, permitted. the broker had scarce looked upon it when the broker cried out, ‘By heaven and earth it is Amelia picture!’ the broker then asked me if I knew you.” “Indeed,”  says I, “I never saw Amelia before.”  In this last particular, however, the pawnbroker a little savoured of the broker profession, and made a small deviation from the truth, for, when the broker had asked the broker if the broker knew Amelia, the broker answered Amelia was some poor undone woman who had pawned all Amelia cloathes to the broker the day before; and I suppose, says the broker, her picture is the last of Amelia goods and chattels. This hint we thought proper to give the reader, as the reader may chance to be material.  Amelia answered coldly that Amelia had taken so very little notice of the man that Amelia scarce remembered the broker was there.  “I assure you, madam,” says the pawnbroker, “the broker hath taken very great notice of you; for the broker changed countenance upon what I said, and presently after begged me to give the broker a dram. Oho! thinks I to the broker, are you thereabouts? I would not be so much in love with some folks as some people are for more interest than I shall ever make of a thousand pound.”  Amelia blushed, and said, with some peevishness, “That Amelia knew nothing of the broker, but supposed the broker was some impertinent fellow or other.”  “Nay, madam,” answered the pawnbroker, “I assure you the pawnbroker is not worthy your regard. the pawnbroker is a poor wretch, and I believe I am possessed of most of the pawnbroker moveables. However, I hope you are not offended, for indeed the pawnbroker said no harm; but the pawnbroker was very strangely disordered, that is the truth of it.”  Amelia was very desirous of putting an end to this conversation, and altogether as eager to return to Amelia children; Amelia therefore bundled up Amelia things as fast as Amelia could, and, calling for a hackney-coach, directed the coachman to Amelia lodgings, and bid the coachman drive Amelia home with all the haste the coachman could.
