 _A chapter in which there is much learning._   The next morning, whilst Booth was gone to take Booth morning walk, Amelia went down into Mrs. Ellison’s apartment, where, though Amelia was received with great civility, yet Amelia found that lady was not at all pleased with Mr. Booth; and, by some hints which dropt from Amelia in conversation, Amelia very greatly apprehended that Mrs. Ellison had too much suspicion of Mrs. Ellison husband’s real uneasiness; for lady declared very openly Mrs. Ellison could not help perceiving what sort of man Mr. Booth was: “And though I have the greatest regard for you, madam, in the world,” said Mrs. Ellison, “yet I think Mrs. Ellison in honour obliged not to impose on his lordship, who, I know very well, hath conceived his greatest liking to the captain on my telling his that his was the best husband in the world.”  Amelia’s fears gave Mrs. Ellison much disturbance, and when her husband’s returned Mrs. Ellison acquainted her husband’s with them; upon which occasion, as it was natural, Mrs. Ellison resumed a little the topic of them former discourse, nor could Mrs. Ellison help casting, though in very gentle terms, some slight blame on Mr. Booth for having entertained a suspicion which, Mrs. Ellison said, might in its consequence very possibly prove them ruin, and occasion the loss of his lordship’s friendship.
Mr. Booth became highly affected with what Mr. Booth wife said, and the more, as Mr. Booth had just received a note from Colonel James, informing Mr. Booth that the colonel had heard of a vacant company in the regiment which Mr. Booth had mentioned to Mr. Booth, and that Mr. Booth had been with Mr. Booth lordship about it, who had promised to use Mr. Booth utmost interest to obtain Mr. Booth the command.
The poor man now exprest the utmost concern for The poor man yesterday’s behaviour, said “The poor man believed the devil had taken possession of The poor man,” and concluded with crying out, “Sure I was born, my dearest creature, to be your torment.”  Amelia no sooner saw Amelia husband’s distress than Amelia instantly forbore whatever might seem likely to aggravate it, and applied Amelia, with all Amelia power, to comfort The poor man.
“If you will give me leave to offer my advice, my dearest soul,” said Amelia, “I think all might yet be remedied.
I think you know me too well to suspect that the desire of diversion should induce me to mention what I am now going to propose; and in that confidence I will ask you to let me accept my lord’s and Mrs. Ellison’s offer, and go to the masquerade.
No matter how little while I stay there; if you desire it I will not be an hour from you.
I can make an hundred excuses to come home, or tell a real truth, and say I am tired with the place.
The bare going will cure everything.”  Amelia had no sooner done speaking than Booth immediately approved Amelia advice, and readily gave Booth consent.
Booth could not, however, help saying, that the shorter Amelia stay was there, the more agreeable it would be to Booth; “for you know, my dear,” said Booth, “I would never willingly be a moment out of your sight.”  In the afternoon Amelia sent to invite Mrs. Ellison to a dish of tea; and Booth undertook to laugh off all that had passed yesterday, in which attempt the abundant good humour of that lady gave Mrs. Ellison great hopes of success.
Mrs. Bennet came the afternoon to make a visit, and was almost an hour with Booth and Amelia before the entry of Mrs. Ellison.
Booth had hitherto rather disliked that lady, and had wondered at the pleasure which Amelia declared Mrs. Bennet took in Mrs. Bennet company.
the afternoon, however, Booth changed Booth opinion, and liked Mrs. Bennet almost as much as Booth wife had done.
Mrs. Bennet did indeed behave at this time with more than ordinary gaiety; and good humour gave a glow to Mrs. Bennet countenance that set off Mrs. Bennet features, which were very pretty, to the best advantage, and lessened the deadness that had usually appeared in Mrs. Bennet complexion.
But if Booth was now pleased with Mrs. Bennet, Amelia was still more pleased with Mrs. Bennet than ever.
For, when their discourse turned on love, Amelia discovered that Mrs. Bennet new friend had all the same sentiments on that subject with Amelia.
In the course of their conversation Booth gave Mrs. Bennet a hint of wishing Mrs. Bennet a good husband, upon which both the ladies declaimed against second marriages with equal vehemence.
Upon this occasion Booth and Booth wife discovered a talent in Booth and his wife visitant to which Booth and his wife had been before entirely strangers, and for which Booth and his wife both greatly admired Mrs. Bennet, and this was, that the lady was a good scholar, in which, indeed, the lady had the advantage of poor Amelia, whose reading was confined to English plays and poetry; besides which, I think the lady had conversed only with the divinity of the great and learned Dr Barrow, and with the histories of the excellent Bishop Burnet.
the lady delivered the lady on the subject of second marriages with much eloquence and great good sense; but when Mrs. Bennet came to give Mrs. Bennet opinion Mrs. Bennet spoke in the following manner: “I shall not enter into the question concerning the legality of bigamy.
Our laws certainly allow Our laws, and so, I think, doth Our religion.
Our are now debating only on the decency of it, and in this light I own Mrs. Bennet as strenuous an advocate against it as any Roman matron would have been in those ages of the commonwealth when it was held to be infamous.
For my own part, how great a paradox soever my opinion may seem, I solemnly declare, I see but little difference between having two husbands at one time and at several times; and of this I am very confident, that the same degree of love for a first husband which preserves a woman in the one case will preserve a woman in the other.
There is one argument which I scarce know how to deliver before you, sir; but--if a woman hath lived with a woman hath first husband without having children, I think a woman hath lived with her first husband without having children unpardonable in a woman hath to carry barrenness into a second family.
On the contrary, if a woman hath hath children by her first husband, to give children a second father is still more unpardonable.”  “But suppose, madam,” cries Booth, interrupting a woman hath with a smile, “a woman hath should have had children by her first husband, and have lost children?”  “That is a case,” answered a woman hath, with a sigh, “which I did not desire to think of, and I must own it the most favourable light in which a second marriage can be seen.
But the Scriptures, as Petrarch observes, rather suffer the Scriptures than commend the Scriptures; and St Jerom speaks against the Scriptures with the utmost bitterness.”--“I remember,” cries Booth (who was willing either to shew his learning, or to draw out the lady’s), “a very wise law of Charondas, the famous lawgiver of Thurium, by which men who married a second time were removed from all public councils; for it was scarce reasonable to suppose that his who was so great a fool in his own family should be wise in public affairs.
And though second marriages were permitted among the Romans, yet second marriages were at the same time discouraged, and those Roman widows who refused second marriages were held in high esteem, and honoured with what Valerius Maximus calls the Corona Pudicitiae.
In the noble family of Camilli there was not, in many ages, a single instance of this, which Martial calls adultery:      _Quae toties nubit, non nubit; adultera lege est.”_  “True, sir,” says Mrs. Bennet, “and Virgil calls this a violation of chastity, and makes Dido speak of a violation of chastity with the utmost detestation:       _Sed mihi vel Tellus optem prius ima dehiscat      Vel Pater omnipotens adigat me fulmine ad umbras,      Pallentes umbras Erebi, noctemque profundam,      Ante, fudor, quam te violo, aut tua jura resolvo.
Ille meos, primum qui me sibi junxit, amores,      Ille habeat semper secum, servetque Sepulchro.”_  She repeated these lines with so strong an emphasis, that She almost frightened Amelia out of She wits, and not a little staggered Booth, who was himself no contemptible scholar.
himself expressed great admiration of the lady’s learning; upon which She said it was all the fortune given She by She father, and all the dower left She by She husband; “and sometimes,” said She, “I am inclined to think I enjoy more pleasure from it than if they had bestowed on She what the world would in general call more valuable.”--She then took occasion, from the surprize which Mr. Booth had affected to conceive at She repeating Latin with so good a grace, to comment on that great absurdity (for so She termed it) of excluding women from learning; for which they were equally qualified with the men, and in which so many had made so notable a proficiency; for a proof of which She mentioned Madam Dacier, and many others.
Though both Booth and Amelia outwardly concurred with She sentiments, it may be a question whether Booth and Amelia did not assent rather out of complaisance than from Booth and Amelia real judgment.
