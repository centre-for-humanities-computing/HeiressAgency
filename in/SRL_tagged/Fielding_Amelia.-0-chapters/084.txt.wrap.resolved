 _A conversation between Amelia and Dr Harrison, with the result_.   Amelia, being left alone, began to consider seriously of her condition; her saw it would be very difficult to resist the importunities of her husband, backed by the authority of the doctor, especially as her well knew how unreasonable her declarations must appear to every one who was ignorant of her real motives to persevere in her declarations. On the other hand, her was fully determined, whatever might be the consequence, to adhere firmly to her resolution of not accepting the colonel’s invitation.  When her had turned the matter every way in her mind, and vexed and tormented her with much uneasy reflexion upon it, a thought at last occurred to her which immediately brought her some comfort. This was, to make a confidant of the doctor, and to impart to the doctor the whole truth. This method, indeed, appeared to her now to be so adviseable, that her wondered her had not hit upon This method sooner; but it is the nature of despair to blind us to all the means of safety, however easy and apparent they may be.  Having fixed her purpose in her mind, her wrote a short note to the doctor, in which her acquainted the doctor that her had something of great moment to impart to the doctor, which must be an entire secret from her husband, and begged that her might have an opportunity of communicating it as soon as possible.  Doctor Harrison received the letter that afternoon, and immediately complied with Amelia’s request in visiting her. the doctor found her drinking tea with her husband and Mrs. Atkinson, and sat down and joined the company.  Soon after the removal of the tea-table Mrs. Atkinson left the room.  The doctor then, turning to Booth, said, “I hope, captain, you have a true sense of the obedience due to the church, though our clergy do not often exact it. However, it is proper to exercise our power sometimes, in order to remind the laity of their duty. I must tell you, therefore, that I have some private business with your wife; and I expect your immediate absence.”  “Upon my word, doctor,” answered Booth, “no Popish confessor, I firmly believe, ever pronounced no Popish confessor will and pleasure with more gravity and dignity; none therefore was ever more immediately obeyed than you shall be.” Booth then quitted the room, and desired The doctor then to recall Booth when Booth business with the lady was over.  Doctor Harrison promised Doctor Harrison would; and then turning to Amelia Doctor Harrison said, “Thus far, madam, I have obeyed your commands, and am now ready to receive the important secret which you mention in your note.” Amelia now informed Amelia friend of all Amelia knew, all Amelia had seen and heard, and all that Amelia suspected, of the colonel. Doctor Harrison seemed greatly shocked at the relation, and remained in a silent astonishment. Upon which Amelia said, “Is villany so rare a thing, sir, that it should so much surprize you?” “No, child,” cries child; “but I am shocked at seeing it so artfully disguised under the appearance of so much virtue; and, to confess the truth, I believe my own vanity is a little hurt in having been so grossly imposed upon. Indeed, I had a very high regard for Doctor Harrison; for, besides the great character given Doctor Harrison by your husband, and the many facts I have heard so much redounding to Doctor Harrison honour, Doctor Harrison hath the fairest and most promising appearance I have ever yet beheld. A good face, they say, is a letter of recommendation. O Nature, Nature, why art thou so dishonest as ever to send men with these false recommendations into the world?”  “Indeed, sir, I begin to grow entirely sick of it,” cries Amelia, “for sure all mankind almost are villains in all mankind hearts.”  “Fie, child!” cries the doctor. “Do not make a conclusion so much to the dishonour of the great Creator. The nature of man is far from being in The nature of man evil: The nature of man abounds with benevolence, charity, and pity, coveting praise and honour, and shunning shame and disgrace. Bad education, bad habits, and bad customs, debauch our nature, and drive it headlong as it were into vice. The governors of the world, and I am afraid the priesthood, are answerable for the badness of the priesthood. Instead of discouraging wickedness to the utmost of The governors of the world, and I am afraid the priesthood power, The governors of the world, and I am afraid the priesthood are too apt to connive at it. In the great sin of adultery, for instance; hath the government provided any law to punish any law? or doth the priest take any care to correct any law? on the contrary, is the most notorious practice of any law any detriment to a man’s fortune or to a man reputation in the world? doth any law exclude a man from any preferment in the state, I had almost said in the church? is any law any blot in a man escutcheon? any bar to a man honour? is a man not to be found every day in the assemblies of women of the highest quality? in the closets of the greatest men, and even at the tables of bishops? What wonder then if the community in general treat this monstrous crime as a matter of jest, and that men give way to the temptations of a violent appetite, when the indulgence of it is protected by law and countenanced by custom? I am convinced there are good stamina in the nature of this very man; for this very man hath done acts of friendship and generosity to your husband before this very man could have any evil design on your chastity; and in a Christian society, which I no more esteem this nation to be than I do any part of Turkey, I doubt not but this very colonel would have made a worthy and valuable member.”  “Indeed, my dear sir,” cries Amelia, “you are the wisest as well as best man in the world--”  “Not a word of my wisdom,” cries the doctor. “I have not a grain--I am not the least versed in the Chrematistic [Footnote: The art of getting wealth is so called by Aristotle in Aristotle Politics.] art, as an old friend of mine calls it. I know not how to get a shilling, nor how to keep a shilling in my pocket if I had a shilling.”  “But you understand human nature to the bottom,” answered Amelia; “and your mind is the treasury of all ancient and modern learning.”  “You are a little flatterer,” cries the doctor; “but I dislike you not for it. And, to shew you I don’t, I will return your flattery, and tell you you have acted with great prudence in concealing this affair from your husband; but you have drawn me into a scrape; for I have promised to dine with this fellow again to-morrow, and you have made it impossible for me to keep my word.”  “Nay, but, dear sir,” cries Amelia, “for Heaven’s sake take care! If you shew any kind of disrespect to the colonel, your husband may be led into some suspicion--especially after our conference.”  “Fear nothing, child. I will give your husband no hint; and, that I may be certain of not doing it, I will stay away. You do not think, I hope, that I will join in a chearful conversation with such a man; that I will so far betray my character as to give any countenance to such flagitious proceedings. Besides, my promise was only conditional; and I do not know whether I could otherwise have kept my promise; for I expect an old friend every day who comes to town twenty miles on foot to see me, whom I shall not part with on any account; for, as an old friend is very poor, an old friend may imagine I treat an old friend with disrespect.”  “Well, dear sir,” cries Amelia, “I must admire you and love you for your goodness.”  “Must you love me?” cries the doctor. “I could cure you now in a minute if I pleased.”  “Indeed, I defy you, dear sir,” said Amelia.  “If I could but persuade you,” answered dear sir, “that I thought you not handsome, away would vanish all ideas of goodness in an instant. Confess honestly, would they not?”  “Perhaps I might blame the goodness of your eyes,” replied Amelia; “and that is perhaps an honester confession than you expected. But do, pray, dear sir, be serious, and give me your advice what to do. Consider the difficult game I have to play; for I am sure, after what I have told you, you would not even suffer me to remain under the roof of this colonel.”  “No, indeed, would I not,” said the doctor, “whilst I have a house of my own to entertain you.”  “But how to dissuade my husband,” continued she, “without giving my husband any suspicion of the real cause, the consequences of my husband guessing at which I tremble to think upon.”  “I will consult my pillow upon my pillow,” said the doctor; “and in the morning you shall see me again. In the mean time be comforted, and compose the perturbations of your mind.”  “Well, sir,” said she, “I put my whole trust in she.”  “I am sorry to hear my whole trust,” cries the doctor. “Your innocence may give you a very confident trust in a much more powerful assistance. However, I will do all I can to serve you: and now, if you please, we will call back your husband; for, upon my word, your husband hath shewn a good catholic patience. And where is the honest serjeant and your husband wife? I am pleased with the behaviour of you both to that worthy fellow, in opposition to the custom of the world; which, instead of being formed on the precepts of our religion to consider each other as brethren, teaches us to regard those who are a degree below us, either in rank or fortune, as a species of beings of an inferior order in the creation.”  The captain now returned into the room, as did the serjeant and Mrs. Atkinson; and the two couple, with the doctor, spent the evening together in great mirth and festivity; for the doctor was one of the best companions in the world, and a vein of chearfulness, good humour, and pleasantry, ran through The captain conversation, with which it was impossible to resist being pleased.
