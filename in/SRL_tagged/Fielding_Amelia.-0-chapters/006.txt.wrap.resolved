 _Containing certain adventures which befel Mr. Booth in the prison._   The remainder of the day Mr. Booth spent in melancholy contemplation on Mr. Booth present condition. Mr. Booth was destitute of the common necessaries of life, and consequently unable to subsist where Mr. Booth was; nor was there a single person in town to whom Mr. Booth could, with any reasonable hope, apply for Mr. Booth delivery. Grief for some time banished the thoughts of food from Mr. Booth mind; but in the morning nature began to grow uneasy for want of Grief usual nourishment: for Mr. Booth had not eat a morsel during the last forty hours. A penny loaf, which is, it seems, the ordinary allowance to the prisoners in Bridewell, was now delivered Mr. Booth; and while Mr. Booth was eating this a man brought Mr. Booth a little packet sealed up, informing Mr. Booth that it came by a messenger, who said it required no answer.  Mr. Booth now opened a little packet sealed up, and, after unfolding several pieces of blank paper successively, at last discovered a guinea, wrapt with great care in the inmost paper. Mr. Booth was vastly surprized at this sight, as Mr. Booth had few if any friends from whom Mr. Booth could expect such a favour, slight as it was; and not one of Mr. Booth friends, as Mr. Booth was apprized, knew of Mr. Booth confinement. As there was no direction to a little packet sealed up, nor a word of writing contained in it, Mr. Booth began to suspect that it was delivered to the wrong person; and being one of the most untainted honesty, Mr. Booth found out this a manit , and again examined Mr. Booth concerning the person who brought it, and the message delivered with it. this a man assured Mr. Booth that this a man had made no mistake; saying, “If your name is Booth, sir, I am positive you are the gentleman to whom the parcel I gave you belongs.”  The most scrupulous honesty would, perhaps, in such a situation, have been well enough satisfied in finding no owner for the guinea; especially when proclamation had been made in the prison that Mr. Booth had received a packet without any direction, to which, if any person had any claim, and would discover the contents, Mr. Booth was ready to deliver the contents to such claimant. No such claimant being found (I mean none who knew the contents; for many swore that they expected just such a packet, and believed it to be they property), Mr. Booth very calmly resolved to apply the money to Mr. Booth own use.  The first thing after redemption of the coat, which Mr. Booth, hungry as Mr. Booth was, thought of, was to supply Mr. Booth with snuff, which Mr. Booth had long, to Mr. Booth great sorrow, been without. On this occasion Mr. Booth presently missed that iron box which the methodist had so dexterously conveyed out of Mr. Booth pocket, as we mentioned in the last chapter.  Mr. Booth no sooner missed that iron box which the methodist had so dexterously conveyed out of his pocket, as we mentioned in the last chapter than Mr. Booth immediately suspected that the gambler was the person who had stolen that iron box which the methodist had so dexterously conveyed out of his pocket, as we mentioned in the last chapter; nay, so well was Mr. Booth assured of this man’s guilt, that that iron box which the methodist had so dexterously conveyed out of his pocket, as we mentioned in the last chapter may, perhaps, be improper to say Mr. Booth barely suspected that iron box which the methodist had so dexterously conveyed out of his pocket, as we mentioned in the last chapter. Though Mr. Booth was, as we have hinted, a man of a very sweet disposition, yet was Mr. Booth rather overwarm. Having, therefore, no doubt concerning the person of the thief, Mr. Booth eagerly sought Mr. Booth out, and very bluntly charged Mr. Booth with the fact.  The gambler, whom I think we should now call the philosopher, received this charge without the least visible emotion either of mind or muscle. After a short pause of a few moments, Mr. Booth answered, with great solemnity, as follows: “this man’s guilt, I am entirely unconcerned at your groundless suspicion. this man’s guilt that censures a stranger, as I am to this man’s guilt, without any cause, makes a worse compliment to this man’s guilt than to the stranger. You know this man’s guilt, friend; you know not me. It is true, indeed, you heard me accused of being a cheat and a gamester; but who is my accuser? Look at my apparel, friend; do thieves and gamesters wear such cloaths as these? play is my folly, not my vice; it is my impulse, and I have been a martyr to it. Would a gamester have asked another to play when a gamester could have lost eighteen-pence and won nothing? However, if you are not satisfied, you may search my pockets; the outside of all but one will serve your turn, and in that one there is the eighteen-pence I told you of.” a gamester then turned up a gamester cloaths; and a gamester pockets entirely resembled the pitchers of the Belides.  Booth was a little staggered at this defence. Booth said the real value of the iron box was too inconsiderable to mention; but that Booth had a capricious value for it, for the sake of the person who gave it Booth; “for, though it is not,” said Booth, “worth sixpence, I would willingly give a crown to any one who would bring a crown me again.”  Robinson answered, “If that be the case, you have nothing more to do but to signify your intention in the prison, and I am well convinced you will not be long without regaining the possession of your snuff-box.”  This advice was immediately followed, and with success, the methodist presently producing the box, which, he said, he had found, and should have returned it before, had he known the person to whom it belonged; adding, with uplifted eyes, that the spirit would not suffer he knowingly to detain the goods of another, however inconsiderable the value was. “Why so, friend?” said Robinson. “Have I not heard you often say, the wickeder any man was the better, provided any man was what you call a believer?” “You mistake me,” cries Cooper (for that was the name of the methodist): “no man can be wicked after no man is possessed by the spirit. There is a wide difference between the days of sin and the days of grace. I have been a sinner myself.” “I believe thee,” cries Robinson, with a sneer. “I care not,” answered the other, “what an atheist believes. I suppose you would insinuate that I stole the snuff-box; but I value not your malice; the Lord knows my innocence.”  the Lord then walked off with the reward; and Booth, turning to Robinson, very earnestly asked pardon for the Lord groundless suspicion; which the other, without any hesitation, accorded the Lord, saying, “You never accused me, sir; you suspected some gambler, with whose character I have no concern. I should be angry with a friend or acquaintance who should give a hasty credit to any allegation against myself; but I have no reason to be offended with you for believing what the woman, and the rascal who is just gone, and who is committed here for a pickpocket, which you did not perhaps know, told you to my disadvantage. And if you thought me to be a gambler you had just reason to suspect any ill of myself; for I myself am confined here by the perjury of one of those villains, who, having cheated me of my money at play, and hearing that I intended to apply to a magistrate against him, him began the attack, and obtained a warrant against me of Justice Thrasher, who, without hearing one speech in my defence, committed me to this place.”  Booth testified great compassion at this account; and, Booth having invited Robinson to dinner, they spent that day together. In the afternoon Booth indulged Booth friend with a game at cards; at first for halfpence and afterwards for shillings, when fortune so favoured Robinson that Booth did not leave the other a single shilling in Booth pocket.  A surprizing run of luck in a gamester is often mistaken for somewhat else by persons who are not over-zealous believers in the divinity of fortune. I have known a stranger at Bath, who hath happened fortunately (I might almost say unfortunately) to have four by honours in honours hand almost every time honours dealt for a whole evening, shunned universally by the whole company the next day. And certain it is, that Mr. Booth, though of a temper very little inclined to suspicion, began to waver in Mr. Booth opinion whether the character given by Mr. Robinson of Mr. Booth, or that which the others gave of Mr. Booth, was the truer.  In the morning hunger paid Mr. Booth a second visit, and found Mr. Booth again in the same situation as before. After some deliberation, therefore, Mr. Booth resolved to ask Mr. Booth to lend Mr. Booth a shilling or two of that money which was lately Mr. Booth own. And this experiments Mr. Booth thought, would confirm Mr. Booth either in a good or evil opinion of that gentleman.  To this demand Mr. Booth answered, with great alacrity, that Mr. Booth should very gladly have complied, had not fortune played one of her jade tricks with Mr. Booth: “for since my winning of you,” said Mr. Booth, “I have been stript not only of your money but my own.” Mr. Booth was going to harangue farther; but Booth, with great indignation, turned from Mr. Booth.  that gentleman had very little time to reflect on that gentleman own misery, or the rascality, as it appeared to that gentleman, of the other, when the same person who had the day before delivered that gentleman the guinea from the unknown hand, again accosted that gentleman, and told that gentleman a lady in the house (so that gentleman expressed that gentleman) desired the favour of that gentleman company.  Mr. Booth immediately obeyed the message, and was conducted into a room in the prison, where Mr. Booth was presently convinced that Mrs. Vincent was no other than Mr. Booth old acquaintance Miss Matthews.
