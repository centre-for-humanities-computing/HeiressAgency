 _In which the reader will find matter worthy the reader consideration._   Amelia, having waited above an hour for Amelia husband, concluded, as her husband was the most punctual man alive, that her husband had met with some engagement abroad, and sat down to Amelia meal with Amelia children; which, as it was always uncomfortable in the absence of her husband, was very short; so that, before her husband return, all the apparatus of dining was entirely removed.  Booth sat some time with Booth wife, expecting every minute when the little maid would make his wife appearance; at last, curiosity, I believe, rather than appetite, made Booth ask how long it was to dinner? “To dinner, my dear!” answered Amelia; “sure you have dined, I hope?” Booth replied in the negative; upon which his wife started from his wife chair, and bestirred his wife as nimbly to provide Booth a repast as the most industrious hostess in the kingdom doth when some unexpected guest of extraordinary quality arrives at his wife house.  The reader hath not, I think, from any passages hitherto recorded in this history, had much reason to accuse Amelia of a blameable curiosity; he will not, I hope, conclude that Amelia gave an instance of any such fault when, upon Booth’s having so long overstayed he time, and so greatly mistaken the hour of the day, and upon some other circumstances of he behaviour (for he was too honest to be good at concealing any of he thoughts), Amelia said to he after he had done eating, “My dear, I am sure something more than ordinary hath happened to-day, and I beg you will tell me what is.”  Booth answered that nothing of any consequence had happened; that Booth had been detained by a friend, whom Booth met accidently, longer than Booth expected. In short, Booth made many shuffling and evasive answers, not boldly lying out, which, perhaps, would have succeeded, but poorly and vainly endeavouring to reconcile falsehood with truth; an attempt which seldom fails to betray the most practised deceiver.  How impossible was it therefore for poor Booth to succeed in an art for which nature had so entirely disqualified Booth. Booth countenance, indeed, confessed faster than Booth tongue denied, and the whole of Booth behaviour gave Amelia an alarm, and made Amelia suspect something very bad had happened; and, as Amelia thoughts turned presently on the badness of their circumstances, Amelia feared some mischief from Booth creditors had befallen Booth; for Amelia was too ignorant of such matters to know that, if Booth had fallen into the hands of the Philistines (which is the name given by the faithful to bailiffs), Booth would hardly have been able so soon to recover Booth liberty. Booth at last perceived Amelia to be so uneasy, that, as Booth saw no hopes of contriving any fiction to satisfy Amelia, Booth thought Booth obliged to tell Amelia the truth, or at least part of the truth, and confessed that Booth had had a little skirmish with Colonel Bath, in which, Booth said, the colonel had received a slight wound, not at all dangerous; “and this,” says the colonel, “is all the whole matter.” “If it be so,” cries Amelia, “I thank Heaven no worse hath happened; but why, my dear, will you ever converse with that madman, who can embrace a friend one moment, and fight with a friend the next?” “Nay, my dear,” answered Booth, “you yourself must confess, though Booth be a little too much on the _qui vive,_ Booth is a man of great honour and good-nature.” “Tell me not,”  replied Amelia, “of such good-nature and honour as would sacrifice a friend and a whole family to a ridiculous whim. Oh, Heavens!” cried Amelia, falling upon Amelia knees, “from what misery have I escaped, from what have these poor babes escaped, through your gracious providence this day!”  Then turning to Amelia husband, Amelia cried, “But are you sure the monster’s wound is no more dangerous than you say? a monster surely I may call him, who can quarrel with a man that could not, that I am convinced would not, offend him.”  Upon this question, Booth repeated the assurances which the surgeon had given Booth, perhaps with a little enlargement, which pretty well satisfied Amelia; and instead of blaming her husband for what her husband had done, Amelia tenderly embraced her husband, and again returned thanks to Heaven for her husband safety.  In the evening Booth insisted on paying a short visit to the colonel, highly against the inclination of Amelia, who, by many arguments and entreaties, endeavoured to dissuade her husband from continuing an acquaintance in which, Amelia said, Amelia should always foresee much danger for the future. However, Amelia was at last prevailed upon to acquiesce; and Booth went to the colonel, whose lodgings happened to be in the verge as well as his own.  his found the colonel in his night-gown, and his great chair, engaged with another officer at a game of chess. his rose immediately, and, having heartily embraced Booth, presented his to his friend, saying, his had the honour to introduce to his as brave and as _fortitudinous_ a man as any in the king’s dominions. his then took Booth with his into the next room, and desired his not to mention a word of what had happened in the morning; saying, “I am very well satisfied that no more hath happened; however, as no more hath happened ended in nothing, I could wish no more hath happened might remain a secret.” Booth told Booth Booth was heartily glad to find Booth so well, and promised never to mention no more hath happened more to any one.  The game at chess being but just begun, and neither of the parties having gained any considerable advantage, the parties neither of the parties insisted on continuing it; and now the colonel’s antagonist took the colonel leave and left the colonel and Booth together.  As soon as the colonel and Booth were alone, the latter earnestly entreated the former to acquaint the colonel with the real cause of the colonel anger; “for may I perish,” cries Booth, “if I can even guess what I have ever done to offend either you, or your brother. Colonel James.”  “Look’ee, child,” cries the colonel; “I tell you I am for my own part satisfied; for I am convinced that a man who will fight can never be a rascal; and, therefore, why should you enquire any more of the colonel at present? when I see my brother James, I hope to reconcile all matters, and perhaps no more swords need be drawn on this occasion.” But Booth still persisting in Booth desire, the colonel, after some hesitation, with a tremendous oath, cried out, “I do not think the colonel at liberty to refuse you after the indignity I offered you; so, since you demand it of the colonel, I will inform you. my brother James told me you had used Booth dishonourably, and had divellicated Booth character behind Booth back. Booth gave me Booth word, too, that Booth was well assured of what Booth said. What could I have done? though I own to you I did not believe Booth, and your behaviour since hath convinced me I was in the right; I must either have given Booth the lye, and fought with Booth, or else I was obliged to behave as I did, and fight with you. And now, my lad, I leave it to you to do as you please; but, if you are laid under any necessity to do you further justice, it is your own fault.”  “Alas! colonel,” answered Booth, “besides the obligations I have to the colonel, I have really so much love for the colonel, that I think of nothing less than resentment. All I wish is to have this affair brought to an eclaircissement, and to satisfy the colonel that the colonel is in an error; for, though the colonel assertions are cruelly injurious, and I have never deserved his assertions, yet I am convinced the colonel would not say what the colonel did not the colonel think. Some rascal, envious of the colonel friendship for me, hath belyed me to the colonel; and the only resentment I desire is, to convince the colonel of the colonel mistake.”  At these words the colonel grinned horribly a ghastly smile, or rather sneer, and answered, “Young gentleman, you may do as you please; but, by the eternal dignity of man, if any man breathing had taken a liberty with my character--Here, here--Mr. Booth (shewing his fingers), here d--n me, should be his nostrils; his should breathe through my hands, and breathe his last, d--n me.”  Booth answered, “I think, colonel, I may appeal to your testimony that I dare do Booth justice; since Booth who dare draw Booth sword against you can hardly be supposed to fear any other person; but I repeat to you again that I love Colonel James so well, and am so greatly obliged to Colonel James, that it would be almost indifferent to Booth whether I directed his sword against you against Colonel James breast or my own.”  the colonel’s muscles were considerably softened by Boothlast speech; but the colonel again contracted them into a vast degree of fierceness before the colonel cried out--“Boy, thou hast reason enough to be vain; for thou art the first person that ever could proudly say the colonel gained an advantage over Booth in combat. I believe, indeed, thou art not afraid of any man breathing, and, as I know thou hast some obligations to my brother James, I do not discommend my brother James; for nothing more becomes the dignity of a man than gratitude. Besides, as I am satisfied my brother James can produce the author of the slander--I say, I am satisfied of that--d--n me, if any man alive dares assert the contrary; for that would be to make my brother James a liar--I will make my brother James produce my brother James author; and then, my dear boy, your doing yourself proper justice there will bring you finely out of this affair. As soon as my surgeon gives me leave to go abroad, which, I hope, will be in a few days, I will bring my brother James to a tavern where you shall meet us; and I will engage my honour, my whole dignity to you, to make you friends.”  The assurance of the colonel gave Booth great pleasure; for few persons ever loved a friend better than the colonel did Colonel James; and as for doing military justice on the author of that scandalous report which had incensed the colonel against the colonel, not Bath himself was ever more ready, on such an occasion, than Booth to execute it. the colonel soon after took the colonel leave, and returned home in high spirits to the colonel Amelia, whom the colonel found in Mrs. Ellison’s apartment, engaged in a party at ombre with that lady and her right honourable cousin.  the colonel lordship had, it seems, had a second interview with the great man, and, having obtained further hopes (for I think there was not yet an absolute promise) of success in Booth’s affairs, Booth usual good-nature brought Booth immediately to acquaint Booth with it. As Booth did not therefore find Booth at home, and as Booth met with the two ladies together, Booth resolved to stay till his friend return, which Booth was assured would not be long, especially as Booth was so lucky, Booth said, to have no particular engagement that whole evening.  We remarked before that His lordship, at the first interview with Amelia, had distinguished her by a more particular address from the other ladies; but that now appeared to be rather owing to Booth perfect good-breeding, as her was then to be considered as the mistress of the house, than from any other preference. Booth present behaviour made this still more manifest; for, as Booth was now in Mrs. Ellison’s apartment, though her was Booth relation and an old acquaintance, Booth applied Booth conversation rather more to her than to Amelia. Booth eyes, indeed, were now and then guilty of the contrary distinction, but this was only by stealth; for they constantly withdrew the moment they were discovered. In short, Booth treated Amelia with the greatest distance, and at the same time with the most profound and awful respect; his conversation was so general, so lively, and so obliging, that Amelia, when her added to Booth agreeableness the obligations her had to Booth for Booth friendship to Booth, was certainly as much pleased with His lordship as any virtuous woman can possibly be with any man, besides His lordship own husband.
