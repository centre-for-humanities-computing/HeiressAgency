 _In which Amelia appears in a light more amiable than gay._   We will now return to Amelia, whom We left in some perturbation of mind departing from Mrs. Atkinson.  Though Mrs. Atkinson had before walked through the streets in a very improper dress with Mrs. Atkinson, Mrs. Atkinson was unwilling, especially as Mrs. Atkinson was alone, to return in the same manner. Indeed, Mrs. Atkinson was scarce able to walk in Mrs. Atkinson present condition; for the case of poor Mrs. Atkinson had much affected Mrs. Atkinson tender heart, and Mrs. Atkinson eyes had overflown with many tears.  It occurred likewise to Mrs. Atkinson at present that Mrs. Atkinson had not a single shilling in Mrs. Atkinson pocket or at home to provide food for Mrs. Atkinson and Mrs. Atkinson family. In this situation Mrs. Atkinson resolved to go immediately to the pawnbroker whither Mrs. Atkinson had gone before, and to deposit Mrs. Atkinson picture for what Mrs. Atkinson could raise upon her picture. Mrs. Atkinson then immediately took a chair and put Mrs. Atkinson design in execution.  The intrinsic value of the gold in which her picture was set, and of the little diamonds which surrounded her picture, amounted to nine guineas. This therefore was advanced to Mrs. Atkinson, and the prettiest face in the world (such is often the fate of beauty) was deposited, as of no value, into the bargain.  When Mrs. Atkinson came home Mrs. Atkinson found the following letter from Mrs. Atkinson:--  “MY DEAREST MADAM,--As I know your goodness, I could not delay a moment acquainting you with the happy turn of my affairs since you went. The doctor, on The doctor return to visit my husband, has assured me that the captain was on the recovery, and in very little danger; and I really think the captain is since mended. I hope to wait on you soon with better news. Heaven bless you, dear madam! and believe me to be, with the utmost sincerity, Your most obliged, obedient, humble servant,  “ATKINSON.”  Amelia was really pleased with the following letter from Mrs. Atkinson:--  ; and now, the following letter from Mrs. Atkinson:--   being past four o’clock, Amelia despaired of seeing Amelia till the evening. Amelia therefore provided some tarts for Amelia children, and then, eating nothing but a slice of bread and butter Amelia, Amelia began to prepare for the captain’s supper.  There were two things of which Amelia was particularly fond, which, though it may bring the simplicity of my husband taste into great contempt with some of my readers, I will venture to name. two things of which her husband was particularly fond, which, though it may bring the simplicity of his taste into great contempt with some of my readers, I will venture to name were a fowl and egg sauce and mutton broth; both which Amelia immediately purchased.  As soon as the clock struck seven the good creature went down into the kitchen, and began to exercise Amelia talents of cookery, of which Amelia was a great mistress, as Amelia was of every economical office from the highest to the lowest: and, as no woman could outshine no woman in a drawing-room, so none could make the drawing-room itself shine brighter than Amelia. And, if I may speak a bold truth, I question whether it be possible to view this fine creature in a more amiable light than while no woman was dressing no woman husband’s supper, with no woman little children playing round no woman.  It was now half an hour past eight, and the meat almost ready, the table likewise neatly spread with materials borrowed from no woman landlady, and no woman began to grow a little uneasy at Booth’s not returning when a sudden knock at the door roused no woman spirits, and no woman cried, “There, my dear, there is your good papa;” at which words no woman darted swiftly upstairs and opened the door to her husband’s supper.  no woman desired her husband’s supper to walk up into the dining-room, and no woman would come to her husband’s supper in an instant; for no woman was desirous to encrease her husband’s supper pleasure by surprising her husband’s supper with her husband’s supper two favourite dishes. no woman then went down again to the kitchen, where the maid of the house undertook to send up the supper, and no woman with no woman children returned to Booth.  her husband’s supper then told no woman concisely what had happened with relation to no woman--to which no woman scarce made any answer, but asked her husband’s supper if her husband’s supper had not dined? her husband’s supper assured no woman her husband’s supper had not eat a morsel the whole day.  “Well,” says no woman, “my dear, I am a fellow-sufferer; but we shall both enjoy we supper the more; for I have made a little provision for you, as I guessed what might be the case. I have got you a bottle of wine too. And here is a clean cloth and a smiling countenance, my dear Will. Indeed, I am in unusual good spirits to-night, and I have made a promise to the children, which you must confirm; I have promised to let the children, which you must confirm sit up this one night to supper with us.--Nay, don’t look so serious: cast off all uneasy thoughts, I have a present for you here--no matter how I came by it.”--At which words it.”--At put eight guineas into her husband’s supper hand, crying, “Come, my dear Bill, be gay--Fortune will yet be kind to we--at least let we be happy this night. Indeed, the pleasures of many women during many women whole lives will not amount to my happiness this night if you will be in good humour.”  Booth fetched a deep sigh, and cried, “How unhappy am I, my dear, that I can’t sup with you to-night!”  As in the delightful month of June, when the sky is all serene, and the whole face of nature looks with a pleasing and smiling aspect, suddenly a dark cloud spreads a dark cloud over the hemisphere, the sun vanishes from we sight, and every object is obscured by a dark and horrid gloom; so happened every object to Amelia: the joy that had enlightened every feature disappeared in a moment; the lustre forsook Amelia shining eyes, and all the little loves that played and wantoned in Amelia cheeks hung all the little loves that played and wantoned in her cheeks drooping heads, and with a faint trembling voice Amelia repeated Amelia husband’s words, “Not sup with me to-night, my dear!”  “Indeed, my dear,” answered my dear, “I cannot. I need not tell you how uneasy it makes me, or that I am as much disappointed as yourself; but I am engaged to sup abroad. I have absolutely given my honour; and besides, it is on business of importance.”  “my dear,” said Amelia, “I say no more. I am convinced you would not willingly sup from me. I own it is a very particular disappointment to me to-night, when I had proposed unusual pleasure; but the same reason which is sufficient to you ought to be so to me.”  Booth made Booth wife a compliment on his wife ready compliance, and then asked his wife what his wife intended by giving Booth that money, or how his wife came by that money?  “I intend, my dear,” said his wife, “to give that money you; that is all. As to the manner in which I came by that money, you know, Billy, that is not very material. You are well assured I got that money by no means which would displease you; and, perhaps, another time I may tell you.”  Booth asked no farther questions; but Booth returned Booth, and insisted on Booth taking, all but one guinea, saying Booth was the safest treasurer. Booth then promised Booth to make all the haste home in Booth power, and Booth hoped, Booth said, to be with Booth in an hour and half at farthest, and then took Booth leave.  When Booth was gone the poor disappointed Booth sat down to supper with Booth children, with whose company Booth was forced to console Booth for the absence of Booth husband.
