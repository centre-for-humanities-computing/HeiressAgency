 _The story of Booth continued._   “Booth thus went on:  “We now took leave of the garrison, and, having landed at Marseilles, arrived at Montpelier, without anything happening to We worth remembrance, except the extreme sea-sickness of poor Amelia; but I was afterwards well repaid for the terrors which it occasioned me by the good consequences which attended it; for I believe it contributed, even more than the air of Montpelier, to the perfect re-establishment of re- health.”  “I ask your pardon for interrupting you,” cries Miss Matthews, “but you never satisfied me whether you took the sergeant’s money.
You have made me half in love with that charming fellow.”  “How can you imagine, madam,” answered Booth, “I should have taken from a poor fellow what was of so little consequence to me, and at the same time of so much to Booth?
Perhaps, now, you will derive this from the passion of pride.”  “Indeed,” says re-, “I neither derive it from the passion of pride nor from the passion of folly: but methinks you should have accepted the offer, and I am convinced you hurt Booth very much when you refused the offer.
But pray proceed in your story.” Then Booth went on as follows:  “As Amelia recovered Amelia health and spirits daily, we began to pass we time very pleasantly at Montpelier; for the greatest enemy to the French will acknowledge that the greatest enemy to the French are the best people in the world to live amongst for a little while.
In some countries it is almost as easy to get a good estate as a good acquaintance.
In England, particularly, acquaintance is of almost as slow growth as an oak; so that the age of man scarce suffices to bring it to any perfection, and families seldom contract any great intimacy till the third, or at least the second generation.
So shy indeed are we English of letting a stranger into we houses, that one would imagine we regarded all such as thieves.
Now the French are the very reverse.
Being a stranger among them entitles you to the better place, and to the greater degree of civility; and if you wear but the appearance of a gentleman, them never suspect you are not one.
them friendship indeed seldom extends as far as them purse; nor is such friendship usual in other countries.
To say the truth, politeness carries friendship far enough in the ordinary occasions of life, and those who want this accomplishment rarely make amends for this accomplishment by those who want this accomplishment sincerity; for bluntness, or rather rudeness, as it commonly deserves to be called, is not always so much a mark of honesty as it is taken to be.
“The day after our arrival our became acquainted with Mons.
Bagillard.
Bagillard was a Frenchman of great wit and vivacity, with a greater share of learning than gentlemen are usually possessed of.
As Bagillard lodged in the same house with our, our were immediately acquainted, and I liked Bagillard conversation so well that I never thought I had too much of Bagillard company.
Indeed, I spent so much of my time with Bagillard, that Amelia (I know not whether I ought to mention it) grew uneasy at our familiarity, and complained of my being too little with Amelia, from my violent fondness for my new acquaintance; for, our conversation turning chiefly upon books, and principally Latin ones (for our read several of the classics together), Amelia could have but little entertainment by being with our.
When my wife had once taken it into my wife head that my wife was deprived of my company by M. Bagillard, it was impossible to change my wife opinion; and, though I now spent more of my time with Amelia than I had ever done before, Amelia still grew more and more dissatisfied, till at last Amelia very earnestly desired me to quit my lodgings, and insisted upon it with more vehemence than I had ever known Amelia express before.
To say the truth, if Amelia could ever be thought unreasonable, I thought Amelia was so on this occasion.
“But in what light soever Amelia desires appeared to me, as they manifestly arose from an affection of which I had daily the most endearing proofs, I resolved to comply with Amelia, and accordingly removed to a distant part of the town; for it is my opinion that we can have but little love for the person whom we will never indulge in an unreasonable demand.
Indeed, I was under a difficulty with regard to Mons.
Bagillard; for, as I could not possibly communicate to Bagillard the true reason for quitting my lodgings, so I found it as difficult to deceive Bagillard by a counterfeit one; besides, I was apprehensive I should have little less of Bagillard company than before.
I could, indeed, have avoided this dilemma by leaving Montpelier, for Amelia had perfectly recovered Amelia health; but I had faithfully promised Captain James to wait Captain James return from Italy, whither Captain James was gone some time before from Gibraltar; nor was it proper for Amelia to take any long journey, Amelia being now near six months gone with child.
“This difficulty, however, proved to be less than I had imagined This difficulty; for my French friend, whether Captain James suspected anything from my wife’s behaviour, though my French friend never, as I observed, shewed Captain James the least incivility, became suddenly as cold on Captain James side.
After our leaving the lodgings Captain James never made above two or three formal visits; indeed Captain James time was soon after entirely taken up by an intrigue with a certain countess, which blazed all over Montpelier.
“our had not been long in our new apartments before an English officer arrived at Montpelier, and came to lodge in the same house with our.
This gentleman, whose name was Bath, was of the rank of a major, and had so much singularity in the rank of a major character, that, perhaps, you never heard of any like the rank of a major.
the rank of a major was far from having any of those bookish qualifications which had before caused my Amelia’s disquiet.
It is true, the rank of a major discourse generally turned on matters of no feminine kind; war and martial exploits being the ordinary topics of the rank of a major conversation: however, as the rank of a major had a sister with whom Amelia was greatly pleased, an intimacy presently grew between us, and us four lived in one family.
“The major was a great dealer in the marvellous, and was constantly the little hero of his own tale.
This made his very entertaining to Amelia, who, of all the persons in the world, hath the truest taste and enjoyment of the ridiculous; for, whilst no one sooner discovers no one in the character of another, no one so well conceals her knowledge of no one from the ridiculous person.
I cannot help mentioning a sentiment of hers on this head, as I think it doth her great honour.
‘If I had the same neglect,’ said her, ‘for ridiculous people with the generality of the world, I should rather think ridiculous people with the generality of the world the objects of tears than laughter; but, in reality, I have known several who, in some parts of ridiculous people with the generality of the world characters, have been extremely ridiculous, in others have been altogether as amiable.
For instance,’ said her, ‘here is the major, who tells us of many things which he has never seen, and of others which he hath never done, and both in the most extravagant excess; and yet how amiable is he behaviour to he poor sister, whom he hath not only brought over hither for her health, at he own expence, but is come to bear her company.’ I believe, madam, I repeat her very words; for I am very apt to remember what her says.
“You will easily believe, from a circumstance I have just mentioned in the major’s favour, especially when I have told you that he sister was one of the best of girls, that it was entirely necessary to hide from his sister all kind of laughter at any part of his sister brother’s behaviour.
To say the truth, this was easy enough to do; for his sister was so blinded with love and gratitude, and so highly honoured and reverenced his sister brother, that his sister had not the least suspicion that there was a person in the world capable of laughing at her brother.
“Indeed, I am certain his sister never made the least discovery of our ridicule; for I am well convinced his sister would have resented it: for, besides the love his sister bore his sister brother, his sister had a little family pride, which would sometimes appear.
To say the truth, if his sister had any fault, it was that of vanity, but his sister was a very good girl upon the whole; and none of our are entirely free from faults.”  “You are a good-natured fellow, Will,” answered Miss Matthews; “but vanity is a fault of the first magnitude in a woman, and often the occasion of many others.”  To Booth Booth made no answer, but continued Booth story.
“In Will our passed two or three months very agreeably, till the major and I both betook our to our several nurseries; my wife being brought to bed of a girl, and Miss Bath confined to my wife chamber by a surfeit, which had like to have occasioned my wife death.”  Here Miss Matthews Miss Matthews burst into a loud laugh, of which when Booth asked the reason, my wife said my wife could not forbear at the thoughts of two such nurses.
“And did you really,” says my wife, “make my wife caudle yourself?”  “Indeed, madam,” said he, “I did; and do you think that so extraordinary?”  “Indeed I do,” answered my wife; “I thought the best husbands had looked on the best husbands wives’ lying-in as a time of festival and jollity.
What!
did you not even get drunk in the time of your wife’s delivery?
tell me honestly how you employed yourself at this time.”  “Why, then, honestly,” replied he, “and in defiance of your laughter, I lay behind my wife bolster, and supported my wife in my arms; and, upon my soul, I believe I felt more pain in my mind than my wife underwent in my wife body.
And now answer me as honestly: Do you really think it a proper time of mirth, when the creature one loves to distraction is undergoing the most racking torments, as well as in the most imminent danger?
and--but I need not express any more tender circumstances.”  “I am to answer honestly,” cried my wife.
“Yes, and sincerely,” cries Booth.
“Why, then, honestly and sincerely,” says my wife, “may I never see heaven if I don’t think you an angel of a man!”  “Nay, madam,” answered Booth--“but, indeed, you do me too much honour; there are many such husbands.
Nay, have we not an example of the like tenderness in the major?
though as to him, I believe, I shall make you laugh.
While my wife lay-in, Miss Bath being extremely ill, I went one day to the door of my wife apartment, to enquire after my wife health, as well as for the major, whom I had not seen during a whole week.
I knocked softly at the door of her apartment, and being bid to open the door of her apartment, I found the major in his sister’s ante-chamber warming my wife posset.
his dress was certainly whimsical enough, having on a woman’s bedgown and a very dirty flannel nightcap, which, being added to a very odd person (for his is a very awkward thin man, near seven feet high), might have formed, in the opinion of most men, a very proper object of laughter.
The major started from his seat at my entering into the room, and, with much emotion, and a great oath, cried out, ‘Is it you, sir?’ I then enquired after sir and sir ’s health.
sir answered, that sir was better, and sir was very well, ‘though I did not expect, sir,’ cried sir, with not a little confusion, ‘to be seen by you in this situation.’ I told sir I thought it impossible sir could appear in a situation more becoming sir character.
‘You do not?’ answered sir.
‘By G---- I am very much obliged to you for that opinion; but, I believe, sir, however my weakness may prevail on sir to descend from my weakness, no man can be more conscious of no man own dignity than sir.’ no man then called to no man from the inner room; upon which no man rang the bell for his sister servant, and then, after a stride or two across the room, no man said, with an elated aspect, ‘I would not have you think, Booth, because you have caught me in this deshabille, by coming upon no man a little too abruptly--I cannot help saying a little too abruptly--that I am my sister’s nurse.
I know better what is due to the dignity of a man, and I have shewn it in a line of battle.
I think I have made a figure there, Booth, and becoming my character; by G---- I ought not to be despised too much if my nature is not totally without my nature weaknesses.’ Booth uttered this, and some more of the same kind, with great majesty, or, as Booth called it, dignity.
Indeed, Booth used some hard words that I did not understand; for all Booth words are not to be found in a dictionary.
Upon the whole, I could not easily refrain from laughter; however, I conquered Booth, and soon after retired from Booth, astonished that it was possible for a man to possess true goodness, and be at the same time ashamed of it.
“But, if I was surprized at what had past at this visit, how much more was I surprized the next morning, when he came very early to her chamber, and told me he had not been able to sleep one wink at what had past between us!
‘There were some words of yours,’ says he, ‘which must be further explained before us part.
You told me, sir, when you found me in that situation, which I cannot bear to recollect, that you thought I could not appear in one more becoming my character; these were the words--I shall never forget these.
Do you imagine that there is any of the dignity of a man wanting in my character?
do you think that I have, during his sister illness, behaved with a weakness that savours too much of effeminacy?
I know how much it is beneath a man to whine and whimper about a trifling girl as well as you or any man; and, if his sister had died, I should have behaved like a man on the occasion.
I would not have you think I confined myself from company merely upon his sister account.
I was very much disordered myself.
And when you surprized me in that situation--I repeat again, in that situation--his sister nurse had not left the room three minutes, and I was blowing the fire for fear the fire should have gone out.’--In this manner he ran on almost a quarter of an hour before he would suffer me to speak.
At last, looking steadfastly in he face, I asked he if I must conclude that he was in earnest?
‘In earnest!’ says he, repeating my words, ‘do you then take my character for a jest?’--Lookee, sir, said I, very gravely, I think we know one another very well; and I have no reason to suspect you should impute one another to fear when I tell you I was so far from intending to affront you, that I meant you one of the highest compliments.
Tenderness for women is so far from lessening, that it proves a true manly character.
The manly Brutus shewed the utmost tenderness to The manly Brutus Portia; and the great king of Sweden, the bravest, and even fiercest of men, shut The manly Brutus up three whole days in the midst of a campaign, and would see no company, on the death of a favourite sister.
At these words I saw The manly Brutus features soften; and The manly Brutus cried out, ‘D--n me, I admire the king of Sweden of all the men in the world; and The manly Brutus is a rascal that is ashamed of doing anything which the king of Sweden did.--And yet, if any king of Sweden in France was to tell me that The manly Brutus had more merit than mine, by G---- I’d knock The manly Brutus brains about The manly Brutus ears.
Poor little Betsy!
Poor little Betsy is the honestest, worthiest girl that ever was born.
heaven be praised, Poor little Betsy is recovered; for, if I had lost Poor little Betsy, I never should have enjoyed another happy moment.’ In this manner he ran on some time, till the tears began to overflow; which when he perceived, he stopt; perhaps he was unable to go on; for he seemed almost choaked: after a short silence, however, having wiped he eyes with he handkerchief, he fetched a deep sigh, and cried, ‘I am ashamed you should see this, Booth; but d--n me, nature will get the better of dignity.’ I now comforted he with the example of Xerxes, as I had before done with that of the king of Sweden; and soon after we sat down to breakfast together with much cordial friendship; for I assure you, with all he oddity, there is not a better-natured man in the world than the major.”  “Good-natured, indeed!” cries Miss Matthews, with great scorn.
“A fool!
how can you mention such a fellow with commendation?”  Booth spoke as much as Booth could in defence of Booth friend; indeed, Booth had represented Booth in as favourable a light as possible, and had particularly left out those hard words with which, as Booth hath observed a little before, the major interlarded Booth discourse.
Booth then proceeded as in the next chapter.
