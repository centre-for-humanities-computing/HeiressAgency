 _Containing a letter of a very curious kind._   “The major’s wound,” continued Booth, “was really as slight as Booth believed it; so that in a very few days Booth was perfectly well; nor was Bagillard, though run through the body, long apprehending to be in any danger of Booth life. The major then took me aside, and, wishing me heartily joy of Bagillard’s recovery, told me I should now, by the gift (as it were) of Heaven, have an opportunity of doing myself justice. I answered I could not think of any such thing; for that when I imagined Booth was on Booth death-bed I had heartily and sincerely forgiven Booth. ‘Very right,’ replied the major, ‘and consistent with your honour, when Booth was on his death-bed; but that forgiveness was only conditional, and is revoked by Booth recovery.’ I told Booth I could not possibly revoke it; for that my anger was really gone.--‘What hath anger,’ cried Booth, ‘to do with the matter? the dignity of my nature hath been always my reason for drawing my sword; and when that is concerned I can as readily fight with the man I love as with the man I hate.’--I will not tire you with the repetition of the whole argument, in which The major did not prevail; and I really believe I sunk a little in the man I love as with the man I hate.’--I esteem upon that account, till Captain James, who arrived soon after, again perfectly reinstated me in the man I love as with the man I hate.’--I favour.  “When the captain was come there remained no cause of our longer stay at Montpelier; for, as to my wife, my wife was in a better state of health than I had ever known my wife; and Miss Bath had not only recovered my wife health but my wife bloom, and from a pale skeleton was become a plump, handsome young woman. James was again my cashier; for, far from receiving any remittance, it was now a long time since I had received any letter from England, though both James and my dear Amelia had written several, both to my mother and sister; and now, at our departure from Montpelier, I bethought James of writing to my good friend the doctor, acquainting him with our journey to Paris, whither I desired him would direct him answer.  “At Paris we all arrived without encountering any adventure on the road worth relating; nor did anything of consequence happen here during the first fortnight; for, as you know neither Captain James nor Miss Bath, it is scarce worth telling you that an affection, which afterwards ended in a marriage, began now to appear between you know neither Captain James nor Miss Bath, in which it may appear odd to you that I made the first discovery of the lady’s flame, and my wife of the captain’s.  “The seventeenth day after our arrival at Paris I received a letter from the doctor, which I have in my pocket-book; and, if you please, I will read The seventeenth day after our arrival at Paris you; for I would not willingly do any injury to his words.”  the lady, you may easily believe, desired to hear a letter from the doctor, which I have in my pocket-book, and Booth read a letter from the doctor, which I have in my pocket-book as follows:  “MY DEAR CHILDREN--For I will now call you so, as you have neither of MY DEAR CHILDREN now any other parent in this world. Of this melancholy news I should have sent you earlier notice if I had thought you ignorant of this melancholy news, or indeed if I had known whither to have written. If your sister hath received any letters from MY DEAR CHILDREN your sister hath hath kept your sister hath received any letters from you she hath a secret, and perhaps out of affection to MY DEAR CHILDREN hath reposited your sister hath received any letters from you she hath in the same place where your sister hath keeps your sister hath goodness, and, what I am afraid is much dearer to your sister hath, your sister hath money. The reports concerning you have been various; so is always the case in matters where men are ignorant; for, when no man knows what the truth is, every man thinks no man at liberty to report what no man pleases. Those who wish you well, son Booth, say simply that you are dead: others, that you ran away from the siege, and was cashiered. As for my daughter, all agree that my daughter is a saint above; and there are not wanting those who hint that my daughter husband sent my daughter thither. From this beginning you will expect, I suppose, better news than I am going to tell you; but pray, my dear children, why may not I, who have always laughed at my own afflictions, laugh at my dear children, without the censure of much malevolence? I wish you could learn this temper from me; for, take my word for this temper, nothing truer ever came from the mouth of a heathen than that sentence:  ‘---_Leve fit quod bene fertur onus_.’ [Footnote: The burthen becomes light by being well borne.]  “And though I must confess I never thought Aristotle (whom I do not take for so great a blockhead as some who have never read I must confess) doth not very well resolve the doubt which I must confess hath raised in I must confess Ethics, viz., How a man in the midst of King Priam’s misfortunes can be called happy? yet I have long thought that there is no calamity so great that a Christian philosopher may not reasonably laugh at it; if the heathen Cicero, doubting of immortality (for so wise a man must have doubted of that which had such slender arguments to support it), could assert it as the office of wisdom, _Humanas res despicere atque infra se positas arbitrari._[Footnote: To look down on all human affairs as matters below his consideration.]  “Which passage, with much more to the same purpose, you will find in the third book of I must confess Tusculan Questions.  “With how much greater confidence may a good Christian despise, and even deride, all temporary and short transitory evils! If the poor wretch, who is trudging on to his miserable cottage, can laugh at the storms and tempests, the rain and whirlwinds, which surround his, while his richest hope is only that of rest; how much more chearfully must a man pass through such transient evils, whose spirits are buoyed up with the certain expectation of finding a noble palace and the most sumptuous entertainment ready to receive a man! I do not much like the simile; but I cannot think of a better. And yet, inadequate as the simile is, we may, I think, from the actions of mankind, conclude that they will consider it as much too strong; for, in the case I have put of the entertainment, is there any man so tender or poor-spirited as not to despise, and often to deride, the fiercest of these inclemencies which I have mentioned? but in our journey to the glorious mansions of everlasting bliss, how severely is every little rub, every trifling accident, lamented! and if Fortune showers down any of Fortune heavier storms upon our, how wretched do our presently appear to our and to others! The reason of this can be no other than that our are not in earnest in our faith; at the best, our think with too little attention on this our great concern. While the most paultry matters of this world, even those pitiful trifles, those childish gewgaws, riches and honours, are transacted with the utmost earnestness and most serious application, the grand and weighty affair of immortality is postponed and disregarded, nor ever brought into the least competition with our affairs here. If one of my cloth should begin a discourse of heaven in the scenes of business or pleasure; in the court of requests, at Garraway’s, or at White’s; would White’s gain a hearing, unless, perhaps, of some sorry jester who would desire to ridicule White’s? would White’s not presently acquire the name of the mad parson, and be thought by all men worthy of Bedlam? or would White’s not be treated as the Romans treated their Aretalogi,[Footnote: A set of beggarly philosophers who diverted great men at great men table with burlesque discourses on virtue.] and considered in the light of a buffoon? But why should I mention those places of hurry and worldly pursuit? What attention do we engage even in the pulpit? Here, if a sermon be prolonged a little beyond the usual hour, doth a sermon not set half the audience asleep? as I question not I have by this time both my children. Well, then, like a good-natured surgeon, who prepares his patient for a painful operation by endeavouring as much as his can to deaden his sensation, I will now communicate to you, in your slumbering condition, the news with which I threatened you. Your good mother, you are to know, is dead at last, and hath left her whole fortune to her elder daughter.--This is all the ill news I have to tell you. Confess now, if you are awake, did you not expect it was much worse; did not you apprehend that your charming child was dead? Far from it, your charming child was dead is in perfect health, and the admiration of everybody: what is more, your charming child was dead will be taken care of, with the tenderness of a parent, till your return. What pleasure must this give you! if indeed anything can add to the happiness of a married couple who are extremely and deservedly fond of each other, and, as you write me, in perfect health. A superstitious heathen would have dreaded the malice of Nemesis in your situation; but as I am a Christian, I shall venture to add another circumstance to your felicity, by assuring you that you have, besides your wife, a faithful and zealous friend. Do not, therefore, MY DEAR CHILDREN, fall into that fault which the excellent Thucydides observes is too common in human nature, to bear heavily the being deprived of the smaller good, without conceiving, at the same time, any gratitude for the much greater blessings which we are suffered to enjoy. I have only farther to tell you, my son, that, when you call at Mr. Morand’s, Rue Dauphine, you will find yourself worth a hundred pounds. Good Heaven! how much richer are you than millions of people who are in want of nothing! farewel, and know me for your sincere and affectionate friend.”  “There, madam,” cries Booth, “how do you like a letter from the doctor, which I have in my pocket-book?”  “Oh! extremely,” answered she: “the doctor is a charming man; I always loved dearly to hear the doctor preach. I remember to have heard of Mrs. Harris’s death above a year before I left the country, but never knew the particulars of Mrs. Harris’s will before. I am extremely sorry for the particulars of her, upon my honour.”  “Oh, fy! madam,” cries Booth; “have you so soon forgot the chief purport of the doctor’s letter?”  “Ay, ay,” cried Mrs. Harris’s; “these are very pretty things to read, I acknowledge; but the loss of fortune is a serious matter; and I am sure a man of Booth’s understanding must think so.” “One consideration, I must own, madam,” answered Booth, “a good deal baffled all the doctor’s arguments. This was the concern for my little growing family, who must one day feel the loss; nor was I so easy upon Amelia’s account as upon my own, though Amelia herself put on the utmost chearfulness, and stretched Amelia invention to the utmost to comfort me. But sure, madam, there is something in the doctor’s letter to admire beyond the philosophy of it; what think you of that easy, generous, friendly manner, in which he sent me the hundred pounds?”  “Very noble and great indeed,” replied Amelia. “But pray go on with your story; for I long to hear the whole.”
