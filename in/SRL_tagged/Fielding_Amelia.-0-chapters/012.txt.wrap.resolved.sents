 _In which Captain Booth begins to relate Captain Booth history._   The tea-table being removed, and Mr. Booth and the lady left alone, Mr. Booth and the lady proceeded as follows:  “Since you desire, madam, to know the particulars of my courtship to that best and dearest of women whom I afterwards married, I will endeavour to recollect that best and dearest of women whom I afterwards married as well as I can, at least all those incidents which are most worth relating to you.
“If the vulgar opinion of the fatality in marriage had ever any foundation, the vulgar opinion of the fatality in marriage had ever any foundation surely appeared in marriage with my Amelia.
I knew my Amelia in the first dawn of my Amelia beauty; and, I believe, madam, my Amelia had as much as ever fell to the share of a woman; but, though I always admired my Amelia, it was long without any spark of love.
Perhaps the general admiration which at that time pursued my Amelia, the respect paid my Amelia by persons of the highest rank, and the numberless addresses which were made my Amelia by men of great fortune, prevented my aspiring at the possession of those charms which seemed so absolutely out of my reach.
However it was, I assure you the accident which deprived my Amelia of the admiration of others made the first great impression on my heart in my Amelia favour.
The injury done to my Amelia beauty by the overturning of a chaise, by which, as you may well remember, my Amelia lovely nose was beat all to pieces, gave me an assurance that the woman who had been so much adored for the charms of my Amelia person deserved a much higher adoration to be paid to my Amelia mind; for that my Amelia was in the latter respect infinitely more superior to the rest of my Amelia sex than my Amelia had ever been in the former.”  “I admire your taste extremely,” cried the lady; “I remember perfectly well the great heroism with which your Amelia bore that misfortune.”  “Good heavens!
madam,” answered he; “what a magnanimity of mind did my Amelia behaviour demonstrate!
If the world have extolled the firmness of soul in a man who can support the loss of fortune; of a general who can be composed after the loss of a victory; or of a king who can be contented with the loss of a crown; with what astonishment ought we to behold, with what praises to honour, a young lady, who can with patience and resignation submit to the loss of exquisite beauty, in other words to the loss of fortune, power, glory, everything which human nature is apt to court and rejoice in!
what must be the mind which can bear to be deprived of all these in a moment, and by an unfortunate trifling accident; which could support all this, together with the most exquisite torments of body, and with dignity, with resignation, without complaining, almost without a tear, undergo the most painful and dreadful operations of surgery in such a situation!” Here he stopt, and a torrent of tears gushed from he eyes; such tears are apt to flow from a truly noble heart at the hearing of anything surprisingly great and glorious.
As soon as he was able he again proceeded thus:  “Would you think, Miss Matthews, that the misfortune of my Amelia was capable of any aggravation?
I assure you, my Amelia hath often told me it was aggravated with a circumstance which outweighed all the other ingredients.
This was the cruel insults my Amelia received from some of my Amelia most intimate acquaintance, several of whom, after many distortions and grimaces, have turned their heads aside, unable to support their secret triumph, and burst into a loud laugh in my Amelia hearing.”  “Good heavens!” cried Miss Matthews; “what detestable actions will this contemptible passion of envy prevail on our sex to commit!”  “An occasion of this kind, as my Amelia hath since told me, made the first impression on my Amelia gentle heart in my favour.
I was one day in company with several young ladies, or rather young devils, where poor my Amelia’s accident was the subject of much mirth and pleasantry.
One of these said my Amelia hoped miss would not hold my Amelia head so high for the future.
Another answered, ‘I do not know, madam, what my Amelia may do with her head, but I am convinced my Amelia will never more turn up my Amelia nose at my Amelia betters.’ Another cried, ‘What a very proper match might now be made between my Amelia and a certain captain,’ who had unfortunately received an injury in the same part, though from no shameful cause.
Many other sarcasms were thrown out, very unworthy to be repeated.
I was hurt with perceiving so much malice in human shape, and cried out very bluntly, Indeed, ladies, you need not express such satisfaction at poor Miss Emily’s accident; for Emily will still be the handsomest woman in England.
This speech of mine was afterwards variously repeated, by some to my honour, and by others represented in a contrary light; indeed, This speech of mine was often reported to be much ruder than This speech of mine was.
However, This speech of mine at length reached my Amelia’s ears.
my Amelia said my Amelia was very much obliged to my Amelia, since I could have so much compassion for my Amelia as to be rude to a lady on my Amelia account.
“About a month after the accident, when my Amelia began to see company in a mask, I had the honour to drink tea with my Amelia.
We were alone together, and I begged my Amelia to indulge my curiosity by showing me my Amelia face.
my Amelia answered in a most obliging manner, ‘Perhaps, Mr. Booth, you will as little know me when my mask is off as when my mask is on;’ and at the same instant unmasked.--The surgeon’s skill was the least I considered.
A thousand tender ideas rushed all at once on my mind.
I was unable to contain my Amelia, and, eagerly kissing my Amelia hand, I cried--Upon my soul, madam, you never appeared to my Amelia so lovely as at this instant.
Nothing more remarkable passed at this visit; but I sincerely believe We were neither of We hereafter indifferent to each other.
“Many months, however, passed after this, before I ever thought seriously of making my Amelia my wife.
Not that I wanted sufficient love for my Amelia.
Indeed Not that I wanted sufficient love for Amelia arose from the vast affection I bore my Amelia.
I considered my own as a desperate fortune, hers as entirely dependent on my Amelia mother, who was a woman, you know, of violent passions, and very unlikely to consent to a match so highly contrary to the interest of my Amelia daughter.
The more I loved my Amelia, The more firmly I resolved within my Amelia never to propose love to my Amelia seriously.
Such a dupe was my understanding to my heart, and so foolishly did I imagine I could be master of a flame to which I was every day adding fuel.
“O, Miss Matthews!
We have heard of men entirely masters of men passions, and of hearts which can carry this fire in men, and conceal this fire at men pleasure.
Perhaps there may be such: but, if there are, those hearts may be compared, I believe, to damps, in which it is more difficult to keep fire alive than to prevent it blazing: in it it was placed in the midst of combustible matter.
“After several visits, in which looks and sighs had been interchanged on both sides, but without the least mention of passion in private, one day the discourse between us when alone happened to turn on love; I say happened, for I protest it was not designed on my side, and I am as firmly convinced not on hers.
I was now no longer master of myself; I declared myself the most wretched of all martyrs to this tender passion; that I had long concealed it from it object.
At length, after mentioning many particulars, suppressing, however, those which must have necessarily brought it home to Amelia, I concluded with begging Amelia to be the confidante of my amour, and to give me Amelia advice on that occasion.
“Amelia (O, I shall never forget the dear perturbation!)
appeared all confusion at this instant.
Amelia trembled, turned pale, and discovered how well Amelia understood me, by a thousand more symptoms than I could take notice of, in a state of mind so very little different from Amelia own.
At last, with faltering accents, Amelia said I had made a very ill choice of a counsellor in a matter in which Amelia was so ignorant.--Adding, at last, ‘I believe, Mr. Booth, you gentlemen want very little advice in these affairs, which you all understand better than we do.’  “I will relate no more of we conversation at present; indeed I am afraid I tire you with too many particulars.”  “O, no!” answered Amelia; “I should be glad to hear every step of an amour which had so tender a beginning.
Tell me everything you said or did, if you can remember it.”  Mr. Booth then proceeded, and so will we in the next chapter.
