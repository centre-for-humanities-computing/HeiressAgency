 _A conversation between Dr Harrison and others_.   The next day Booth and Booth lady, with the doctor, met at Colonel James’s, where Colonel Bath likewise made one of the company.  Nothing very remarkable passed at dinner, or till the ladies withdrew. During this time, however, the behaviour of Colonel James was such as gave some uneasiness to Amelia, who well understood Colonel James meaning, though the particulars were too refined and subtle to be observed by any other present.  When the ladies were gone, which was as soon as Amelia could prevail on Colonel James to depart, Colonel Bath, who had been pretty brisk with champagne at dinner, soon began to display his magnanimity. “My brother tells me, young gentleman,” said My brother to Booth, “that you have been used very ill lately by some rascals, and I have no doubt but you will do My brother justice.”  Booth answered that Booth did not know what Booth meant. “Since I must mention it then,” cries Colonel James, “I hear you have been arrested; and I think you know what satisfaction is to be required by a man of honour.”  “I beg, sir,” says the doctor, “no more may be mentioned of that matter. I am convinced no satisfaction will be required of the captain till the captain is able to give no satisfaction.”  “I do not understand what you mean by able,” cries Colonel James. To which the doctor answered, “That it was of too tender a nature to speak more of.”  “Give me your hand, doctor,” cries Colonel James; “I see you are a man of honour, though you wear a gown. It is, as you say, a matter of a tender nature. Nothing, indeed, is so tender as a man’s honour. Curse my liver, if any man--I mean, that is, if any gentleman, was to arrest me, I would as surely cut his throat as--”  “How, sir!” said the doctor, “would you compensate one breach of the law by a much greater, and pay your debts by committing murder?”  “Why do you mention law between gentlemen?” says Colonel James. “A man of honour wears A man of honour by A man of honour side; and can the resentment of an affront make a gentleman guilty of murder? and what greater affront can one man cast upon another than by arresting one man? I am convinced that one man who would put up an arrest would put up a slap in the face.”  Here Colonel James looked extremely fierce, and the divine stared with astonishment at this doctrine; when Booth, who well knew the impossibility of opposing Colonel James’s humour with success, began to play with it; and, having first conveyed a private wink to the doctor, Colonel James said there might be cases undoubtedly where such an affront ought to be resented; but that there were others where any resentment was impracticable: “As, for instance,” said he, “where the man is arrested by a woman.”  “I could not be supposed to mean that case,” cries Colonel James; “and you are convinced I did not mean that case.”  “To put an end to this discourse at once, sir,” said the doctor, “I was the plaintiff at whose suit this gentleman was arrested.”  “Was you so, sir?” cries Colonel James; “then I have no more to say. Women and the clergy are upon the same footing. The long-robed gentry are exempted from the laws of honour.”  “I do not thank you for that exemption, sir,” cries the doctor; “and, if honour and fighting are, as honour and fighting seem to be, synonymous words with you, I believe there are some clergymen, who in defence of their religion, or their country, or their friend, the only justifiable causes of fighting, except bare self-defence, would fight as bravely as yourself, colonel! and that without being paid for it.”  “sir, you are privileged,” says the colonel, with great dignity; “and you have my leave to say what you please. I respect your order, and you cannot offend me.”  “I will not offend you, colonel,” cries the doctor; “and our order is very much obliged to you, since you profess so much respect to our, and pay none to our Master.”  “What Master, sir?” said the colonel.  “our Master,” answered the doctor, “who hath expressly forbidden all that cutting of throats to which you discover so much inclination.”  “O! your servant, sir,” said the colonel; “I see what you are driving at; but you shall not persuade me to think that religion forces me to be a coward.”  “I detest and despise the name as much as you can,” cries the doctor; “but you have a wrong idea of the word, colonel. What were all the Greeks and Romans? were these cowards? and yet, did you ever hear of this butchery, which we call duelling, among these cowards?”  “Yes, indeed, have I,” cries the colonel. “What else is all Mr. Pope’s Homer full of but duels? Did not what’s Mr. Pope’s Homer name, one of the Agamemnons, fight with that paultry rascal Paris? and Diomede with what d’ye call Mr. Pope’s Homer there? and Hector with I forget Mr. Pope’s Homer name, Mr. Pope’s Homer that was Achilles’s bosom-friend; and afterwards with Achilles himself? Nay, and in Dryden’s Virgil, is there anything almost besides fighting?”  “You are a man of learning, colonel,” cries the doctor; “but--”  “I thank you for that compliment,” said the colonel.--“No, sir, I do not pretend to learning; but I have some little reading, and I am not ashamed to own that compliment.”  “But are you sure, colonel,” cries the doctor, “that you have not made a small mistake? for I am apt to believe both Mr. Pope and Mr. Dryden (though I cannot say I ever read a word of either of both Mr. Pope and Mr. Dryden) speak of wars between nations, and not of private duels; for of the latter I do not remember one single instance in all the Greek and Roman story. In short, it is a modern custom, introduced by barbarous nations since the times of Christianity; though it is a direct and audacious defiance of the Christian law, and is consequently much more sinful in us than it would have been in the heathens.”  “Drink about, doctor,” cries the colonel; “and let us call a new cause; for I perceive us shall never agree on this. You are a Churchman, and I don’t expect you to speak your mind.”  “us are both of the same Church, I hope,” cries doctor.  “I am of the same Church, sir,” answered the colonel, “and will fight for it to the last drop of my blood.”  “It is very generous in you, colonel,” cries doctor, “to fight so zealously for a religion by which you are to be damned.”  “It is well for you, doctor,” cries the colonel, “that you wear a gown; for, by all the dignity of a man, if any other person had said the words you have just uttered, I would have made the colonel eat all the dignity of a man; ay, d--n me, and my sword into the bargain.”  Booth began to be apprehensive that this dispute might grow too warm; in which case Booth feared that the colonel’s honour, together with the champagne, might hurry Booth so far as to forget the respect due, and which Booth professed to pay, to the sacerdotal robe. Booth therefore interposed between the disputants, and said that the colonel had very rightly proposed to call a new subject; for that it was impossible to reconcile accepting a challenge with the Christian religion, or refusing it with the modern notion of honour. “And you must allow it, doctor,”  said doctor, “to be a very hard injunction for a man to become infamous; and more especially for a soldier, who is to lose a man bread into the bargain.”  “Ay, sir,” says the colonel, with an air of triumph, “what say you to that?”  “Why, I say,” cries the doctor, “that it is much harder to be damned on the other side.”  “That may be,” said the colonel; “but damn me, if I would take an affront of any man breathing, for all that. And yet I believe the colonel to be as good a Christian as wears a head. My maxim is, never to give an affront, nor ever to take one; and I say that it is the maxim of a good Christian, and no man shall ever persuade me to the contrary.”  “Well, sir,” said the doctor, “since that is your resolution, I hope no man will ever give you an affront.”  “I am obliged to you for your hope, doctor,” cries the colonel, with a sneer; “and the colonel that doth will be obliged to you for lending the colonel your gown; for, by the dignity of a man, nothing out of petticoats, I believe, dares affront me.”  Colonel James had not hitherto joined in the discourse. In truth, Colonel James thoughts had been otherwise employed; nor is it very difficult for the reader to guess what had been the subject of them. Being waked, however, from Colonel James reverie, and having heard the two or three last speeches, Colonel James turned to Brother, and asked Colonel James, why Colonel James would introduce such a topic of conversation before a gentleman of Doctor Harrison’s character?  “Brother,” cried Bath, “I own it was wrong, and I ask the doctor’s pardon: I know not how it happened to arise; for you know, Brother, I am not used to talk of these matters. these matters are generally poltroons that do. I think I need not be beholden to my tongue to declare I am none. I have shown Colonel James in a line of battle. I believe there is no man will deny that; I believe I may say no man dares deny that I have done my duty.”  the colonel was thus proceeding to prove that the colonel prowess was neither the subject of the colonel discourse nor the object of the colonel vanity, when a servant entered and summoned the company to tea with the ladies; a summons which Colonel James instantly obeyed, and was followed by all the rest.  But as the tea-table conversation, though extremely delightful to those who are engaged in it, may probably appear somewhat dull to the reader, we will here put an end to the chapter.
