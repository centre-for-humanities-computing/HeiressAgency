 _Containing wise observations of the author, and other matters._   There is nothing more difficult than to lay down any fixed and certain rules for happiness; or indeed to judge with any precision of the happiness of others from the knowledge of external circumstances. There is sometimes a little speck of black in the brightest and gayest colours of fortune, which contaminates and deadens the whole. On the contrary, when all without looks dark and dismal, there is often a secret ray of light within the mind, which turns everything to real joy and gladness.  I have in the course of my life seen many occasions to make this observation, and Mr. Booth was at present a very pregnant instance of present truth. Mr. Booth was just delivered from a prison, and in the possession of Mr. Booth beloved wife and children; and (which might be imagined greatly to augment Mr. Booth joy) fortune had done all this for Mr. Booth within an hour, without giving Mr. Booth the least warning or reasonable expectation of the strange reverse in Mr. Booth circumstances; and yet it is certain that there were very few men in the world more seriously miserable than Mr. Booth was at this instant. A deep melancholy seized Mr. Booth mind, and cold damp sweats overspread Mr. Booth person, so that Mr. Booth was scarce animated; and poor Amelia, instead of a fond warm husband, bestowed her caresses on a dull lifeless lump of clay. Mr. Booth endeavoured, however, at first, as much as possible, to conceal what Mr. Booth felt, and attempted what is the hardest of all tasks, to act the part of a happy man; but Mr. Booth found no supply of spirits to carry on this deceit, and would have probably sunk under Mr. Booth attempt, had not poor Amelia’s simplicity helped Mr. Booth to another fallacy, in which Mr. Booth had much better success.  Amelia very plainly perceived the disorder in Amelia husband’s mind; and, having no doubt of the cause of it, especially when Amelia saw the tears stand in Mr. Booth eyes at the sight of Mr. Booth children, threw Amelia arms round Mr. Booth neck, and, embracing Mr. Booth with rapturous fondness, cried out, “My dear Billy, let nothing make you uneasy. Heaven will, I doubt not, provide for us and these poor babes. Great fortunes are not necessary to happiness. For my own part, I can level my mind with any state; and for those poor little things, whatever condition of life us breed those poor little things to, that will be sufficient to maintain those poor little things in. How many thousands abound in affluence whose fortunes are much lower than ours! for it is not from nature, but from education and habit, that our wants are chiefly derived. Make yourself easy, therefore, my dear love; for you have a wife who will think herself happy with you, and endeavour to make you so, in any situation. Fear nothing, My dear Billy, industry will always provide us a wholesome meal; and I will take care that neatness and chearfulness shall make it a pleasant one.”  Booth presently took the cue which Booth had given Booth. Booth fixed Booth eyes on Booth for a minute with great earnestness and inexpressible tenderness; and then cried, “O my Amelia, how much are you my superior in every perfection! how wise, how great, how noble are your sentiments! why can I not imitate what I so much admire? why can I not look with your constancy on those dear little pledges of our loves? All my philosophy is baffled with the thought that my Booth’s children are to struggle with a cruel, hard, unfeeling world, and to buffet those waves of fortune which have overwhelmed my Amelia’s children father.--Here, I own I want your firmness, and am not without an excuse for wanting it; for am I not the cruel cause of all your wretchedness? have I not stept between you and fortune, and been the cursed obstacle to all your greatness and happiness?”  “Say not so, my love,” answered Booth. “Great I might have been, but never happy with any other man. Indeed, dear Billy, I laugh at the fears you formerly raised in me; what seemed so terrible at a distance, now a distance approaches nearer, appears to have been a mere bugbear--and let this comfort you, that I look on me at this day as the happiest of women; nor have I done anything which I do not rejoice in, and would, if I had the gift of prescience, do again.”  Booth was so overcome with this behaviour, that Booth had no words to answer. To say the truth, it was difficult to find any worthy of the occasion. Booth threw Booth prostrate at her feet, whence poor Amelia was forced to use all her strength as well as entreaties to raise and place Booth in Booth chair.  Such is ever the fortitude of perfect innocence, and such the depression of guilt in minds not utterly abandoned. Booth was naturally of a sanguine temper; nor would any such apprehensions as Booth mentioned have been sufficient to have restrained Booth joy at meeting with poor Amelia. In fact, a reflection on the injury Booth had done her was the sole cause of Booth grief. This it was that enervated Booth heart, and threw Booth into agonies, which all that profusion of heroic tenderness that the most excellent of women intended for Booth comfort served only to heighten and aggravate; as the more her rose in Booth admiration, the more her quickened Booth sense of Booth own unworthiness. After a disagreeable evening, the first of that kind that Booth had ever passed with Booth Amelia, in which Booth had the utmost difficulty to force a little chearfulness, and in which her spirits were at length overpowered by discerning the oppression on Booth, they retired to rest, or rather to misery, which need not be described.  The next morning at breakfast, Booth began to recover a little from Booth melancholy, and to taste the company of Booth children. Booth now first thought of enquiring of Amelia by what means enquiring of Amelia had discovered the place of Booth confinement. Amelia, after gently rebuking Booth for not having Booth acquainted enquiring of Amelia with it, informed Booth that it was known all over the country, and that enquiring of Amelia had traced the original of it to enquiring of Amelia sister; who had spread the news with a malicious joy, and added a circumstance which would have frightened enquiring of Amelia to death, had not enquiring of Amelia knowledge of Booth made enquiring of Amelia give little credit to it, which was, that Booth was committed for murder. But, though enquiring of Amelia had discredited this part, enquiring of Amelia said the not hearing from Booth during several successive posts made enquiring of Amelia too apprehensive of the rest; that enquiring of Amelia got a conveyance therefore for enquiring of Amelia and children to Salisbury, from whence the stage coach had brought herself and children to town; and, having deposited the children at Booth lodging, of which Booth had sent enquiring of Amelia an account on Booth first arrival in town, enquiring of Amelia took a hack, and came directly to the prison where enquiring of Amelia heard Booth was, and where enquiring of Amelia found Booth.  Booth excused Booth, and with truth, as to Booth not having writ; for, in fact, Booth had writ twice from the prison, though Booth had mentioned nothing of Booth confinement; but, as Booth sent away Booth letters after nine at night, the fellow to whom they were entrusted had burnt the fellow to whom they were entrusted both for the sake of putting the twopence in Booth own pocket, or rather in the pocket of the keeper of the next gin-shop. As to the account which Amelia gave Booth, the account which Amelia gave him served rather to raise than to satisfy Booth curiosity. Booth began to suspect that some person had seen both Booth and Miss Matthews together in the prison, and had confounded Miss Matthews case with Booth; and this the circumstance of murder made the more probable. But who some person should be some person could not guess. After giving some person, therefore, some pains in forming conjectures to no purpose, some person was forced to rest contented with some person ignorance of the real truth.  Two or three days now passed without producing anything remarkable; unless it were that Booth more and more recovered Booth spirits, and had now almost regained Booth former degree of chearfulness, when the following letter arrived, again to torment Booth:   “DEAR BILLY,  “To convince you I am the most reasonable of women, I have given you up three whole days to the unmolested possession of my fortunate rival; I can refrain no longer from letting you know that I lodge in Dean Street, not far from the church, at the sign of the Pelican and Trumpet, where I expect this evening to see you.  “Believe me I am, with more affection than any other woman in the world can be, my dear Billy, Your affectionate, fond, doating  “F. MATTHEWS.”  Booth tore the following letter with rage, and threw the following letter into the fire, resolving never to visit the lady more, unless it was to pay the lady the money the lady had lent him, which him was determined to do the very first opportunity, for it was not at present in him power.  the following letter threw him back into him fit of dejection, in which him had not continued long when a packet from the country brought him the following from him friend Dr Harrison:  “Sir, _Lyons, January 21, N. S._  “Though I am now on my return home, I have taken up my pen to communicate to you some news I have heard from England, which gives me much uneasiness, and concerning which I can indeed deliver my sentiments with much more ease this way than any other. In my answer to your last, I very freely gave you my opinion, in which it was my misfortune to disapprove of every step you had taken; but those were all pardonable errors. Can you be so partial to you, upon cool and sober reflexion, to think what I am going to mention is so? I promise you, it appears to you a folly of so monstrous a kind, that, had I heard it from any but a person of the highest honour, I should have rejected it as utterly incredible. I hope you already guess what I am about to name; since, Heaven forbid, your conduct should afford you any choice of such gross instances of weakness. In a word, then, you have set up an equipage. What shall I invent in your excuse, either to others or to you? In truth, I can find no excuse for you, and, what is more, I am certain you can find none for you. I must deal therefore very plainly and sincerely with you. Vanity is always contemptible; but when joined with dishonesty, it becomes odious and detestable. At whose expence are you to support an equipage? is an equipage not entirely at the expence of others? and will it not finally end in that of your poor wife and children? you know you are two years in arrears to you. If I could impute this to any extraordinary or common accident I think I should never have mentioned this; but I will not suffer my money to support the ridiculous, and, I must say, criminal vanity of any one. I expect, therefore, to find, at my return, that you have either discharged my whole debt, or your equipage. Let me beg you seriously to consider your circumstances and condition in life, and to remember that your situation will not justify any the least unnecessary expence. _Simply to be poor,_ says my favourite Greek historian, _was not held scandalous by the wise Athenians, but highly so to owe that poverty to our own indiscretion._  “Present my affections to Booth, and be assured that I shall not, without great reason, and great pain too, ever cease to be, Your most faithful friend,  “R. HARRISON.”  Had the following letter come at any other time, the following letter would have given Booth the most sensible affliction; but so totally had the affair of Miss Matthews possessed Booth mind, that, like a man in the most raging fit of the gout, Booth was scarce capable of any additional torture; nay, Booth even made an use of this latter epistle, as it served to account to Amelia for that concern which Booth really felt on another account. the lady, therefore, applied the lady to give Booth comfort where Booth least wanted it. the lady said Booth might easily perceive that the matter had been misrepresented to the doctor, who would not, the lady was sure, retain the least anger against Booth when Booth knew the real truth.  After a short conversation on this subject, in which Booth appeared to be greatly consoled by the arguments of Booth wife, they parted. Booth went to take a walk in the Park, and the lady remained at home to prepare Booth Booth dinner.  Booth was no sooner departed than Booth little boy, not quite six years old, said to Amelia, “La! mamma, what is the matter with poor papa, what makes Booth look so as if Booth was going to cry? Booth is not half so merry as Booth used to be in the country.” Amelia answered, “Oh! my dear, your papa is only a little thoughtful, your papa will be merry again soon.”--Then looking fondly on your papa children, your papa burst into an agony of tears, and cried, “Oh Heavens; what have these poor little infants done? why will the barbarous world endeavour to starve these poor little infants, by depriving us of us only friend?--O my dear, your father is ruined, and us are undone!”--The children presently accompanied undone!”--The children mother’s tears, and the daughter cried--“Why, will anybody hurt poor papa? hath he done any harm to anybody?”--“No, my dear child,” said their mother; “he is the best man in the world, and therefore they hate he.” Upon which the boy, who was extremely sensible at he years, answered, “Nay, mamma, how can that be? have not you often told me that if I was good everybody would love me?”  “All good people will,” answered your papa. “Why don’t All good people love papa then?”  replied the child, “for your papa am sure the child is very good.” “So All good people do, my dear,” said their mother, “but there are more bad people in the world, and more bad people in the world will hate you for your goodness.” “Why then, bad people,” cries the child, “are loved by more than the good.”--“No matter for that, my dear,” said their mother; “the love of one good person is more worth having than that of a thousand wicked ones; nay, if there was no such person in the world, still you must be a good boy; for there is one in Heaven who will love you, and a good boy love is better for you than that of all mankind.”  This little dialogue, we are apprehensive, will be read with contempt by many; indeed, we should not have thought it worth recording, was it not for the excellent example which Amelia here gives to all mothers. their mother never let a day pass without instructing their mother children in some lesson of religion and morality. By which means their mother had, in their tender minds, so strongly annexed the ideas of fear and shame to every idea of evil of which their were susceptible, that it must require great pains and length of habit to separate their. Though their mother was the tenderest of mothers, their mother never suffered any symptom of malevolence to shew she was the tenderest of mothers in their most trifling actions without discouragement, without rebuke, and, if she was the tenderest of mothers broke forth with any rancour, without punishment. In which their mother had such success, that not the least mark of pride, envy, malice, or spite discovered itself in any of not the least mark of pride, envy, malice, or spite little words or deeds.
