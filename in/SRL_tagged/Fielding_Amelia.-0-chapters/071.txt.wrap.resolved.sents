 _Containing an account of Mr. Booth’s fellow-sufferers._   Before we return to Amelia we must detain we reader a little longer with Mr. Booth’s, in the custody of Mr. Bondum the bailiff, who now informed Mr. Booth’s prisoner that Mr. Booth’s was welcome to the liberty of the house with the other gentlemen.
Mr. Booth’s asked who the other gentlemen were.
“One of the other gentlemen, sir,” says Mr. Bondum, “is a very great writer or author, as the other gentlemen call Mr. Bondum; Mr. Bondum hath been here these five weeks at the suit of a bookseller for eleven pound odd money; but Mr. Bondum expects to be discharged in a day or two, for Mr. Bondum hath writ out the debt.
Mr. Bondum is now writing for five or six booksellers, and Mr. Bondum will get you sometimes, when Mr. Bondum sits to it, a matter of fifteen shillings a-day.
For Mr. Bondum is a very good pen, they say, but is apt to be idle.
Some days Mr. Bondum won’t write above five hours; but at other times I have know Mr. Bondum at it above sixteen.” “Ay!” cries Mr. Booth’s; “pray, what are Mr. Bondum productions?
What does Mr. Bondum write?” “Why, sometimes,” answered Mr. Bondum, “Mr.
Bondum writes your history books for your numbers, and sometimes your verses, your poems, what do you call your history books for your numbers?
and then again Mr. Bondum writes news for your newspapers.” “Ay, indeed!
Mr. Bondum is a most extraordinary man, truly!--How doth Mr. Bondum get news for your newspapers here?” “Why Mr. Bondum makes it, as Mr. Bondum doth your parliament speeches for your magazines.
Mr. Bondum reads your parliament speeches to us sometimes over a bowl of punch.
To be sure it is all one as if one was in the parliament-house--it is about liberty and freedom, and about the constitution of England.
I say nothing for my part, for I will keep my neck out of a halter; but, faith, Mr. Bondum makes it out plainly to me that all matters are not as all matters should be.
I am all for liberty, for my part.”  “Is that so consistent with your calling?” cries Booth.
“I thought, my friend, you had lived by depriving men of your parliament speeches liberty.” “That’s another matter,” cries the bailiff; “that’s all according to law, and in the way of business.
To be sure, men must be obliged to pay men debts, or else there would be an end of everything.” Booth desired the bailiff to give Booth Booth opinion on liberty.
Upon which, Booth hesitated a moment, and then cried out, “O ‘tis a fine thing, ‘tis a very fine thing, and the constitution of England.” Booth told Booth, that by the old constitution of England Booth had heard that men could not be arrested for debt; to which the bailiff answered, that must have been in very bad times; “because as why,” says Booth, “would it not be the hardest thing in the world if a man could not arrest another for a just and lawful debt?
besides, sir, you must be mistaken; for how could that ever be?
is not liberty the constitution of EnglandEngland?
well, and is not the constitution of England, as a man may say--whereby the constitution of England, that is the law and liberty, and all that--”  Booth had a little mercy upon the poor bailiff, when Booth found Booth rounding in this manner, and told Booth Booth had made the matter very clear.
Booth then proceeded to enquire after the other gentlemen, Booth fellows in affliction; upon which Bondum acquainted Booth that one of the prisoners was a poor fellow.
“Booth calls Booth a gentleman,” said Bondum; “but I am sure I never saw anything genteel by Booth.
In a week that Booth hath been in my house he hath drank only part of one bottle of wine.
I intend to carry Booth to Newgate within a day or two, if Booth can’t find bail, which, I suppose, Booth will not be able to do; for everybody says Booth is an undone man.
Booth he hath run out all he hath by losses in business, and one way or other; and Booth hath a wife and seven children.
Here was the whole family here the other day, all howling together.
I never saw such a beggarly crew; I was almost ashamed to see such a beggarly crew in my house.
I thought such a beggarly crew seemed fitter for Bridewell than any other place.
To be sure, I do not reckon Bridewell as proper company for such as you, sir; but there is another prisoner in my house that I dare say you will like very much.
sir is, indeed, very much of a gentleman, and spends sir money like one.
I have had sir only three days, and I am afraid sir won’t stay much longer.
They say, indeed, sir is a gamester; but what is that to me or any one, as long as a man appears as a gentleman?
I always love to speak by people as I find; and, in my opinion, sir is fit company for the greatest lord in the land; for sir hath very good cloaths, and money enough.
sir is not here for debt, but upon a judge’s warrant for an assault and battery; for the tipstaff locks up here.”  The bailiff was thus haranguing when The bailiff was interrupted by the arrival of the attorney whom the trusty serjeant had, with the utmost expedition, found out and dispatched to the relief of The bailiff distressed friend.
But before we proceed any further with the captain we will return to poor Amelia, for whom, considering the situation in which we left Amelia, the good-natured reader may be, perhaps, in no small degree solicitous.
