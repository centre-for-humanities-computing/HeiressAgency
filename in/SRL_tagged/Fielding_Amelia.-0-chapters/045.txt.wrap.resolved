 _Containing matters that require no preface._   When Booth and Booth wife were left alone together Booth and his wife extremely exulted in Booth and his wife good fortune in having found so good a friend as his lordship; nor were Booth and his wife wanting in very warm expressions of gratitude towards Mrs. Ellison. After which Booth and his wife began to lay down schemes of living when Booth should have Booth commission of captain; and, after the exactest computation, concluded that, with economy, Booth and his wife should be able to save at least fifty pounds a-year out of Booth and his wife income in order to pay Booth and his wife debts.  These matters being well settled, Amelia asked Booth what Booth thought of Mrs. Bennet? “I think, my dear,” answered Booth, “that Mrs. Bennet hath been formerly a very pretty woman.” “I am mistaken,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “if Mrs. Bennet be not a very good creature. I don’t know I ever took such a liking to any one on so short an acquaintance. I fancy she hath been a very spritely woman; for, if you observe, Mrs. Bennet discovers by starts a great vivacity in Mrs. Bennet countenance.” “I made the same observation,” cries Booth: “sure some strange misfortune hath befallen Mrs. Bennet.” “A misfortune, indeed!” answered Amelia; “sure, child, you forget what Mrs. Ellison told us, that Mrs. Ellison had lost a beloved husband. A misfortune which I have often wondered at any woman’s surviving.” At which words Mrs. Ellison cast a tender look at Booth, and presently afterwards, throwing Mrs. Ellison upon his neck, cried, “O, Heavens! what a happy creature am I! when I consider the dangers you have gone through, how I exult in my bliss!” The good-natured reader will suppose that Booth was not deficient in returning such tenderness, after which the conversation became too fond to be here related.  The next morning Mrs. Ellison addressed Mrs. Ellison to Booth as follows: “I shall make no apology, sir, for what I am going to say, as it proceeds from my friendship to yourself and your dear lady. I am convinced then, sir, there is a something more than accident in your going abroad only one day in the week. Now, sir, if, as I am afraid, matters are not altogether as well as I wish them, I beg, since I do not believe you are provided with a lawyer, that you will suffer me to recommend one to yourself. The person I shall mention is, I assure you, of much ability in The person I shall mention profession, and I have known The person I shall mention do great services to gentlemen under a cloud. Do not be ashamed of your circumstances, my dear friend: they are a much greater scandal to those who have left so much merit unprovided for.”  Booth gave Mrs. Ellison abundance of thanks for Booth kindness, and explicitly confessed to Booth that Booth conjectures were right, and, without hesitation, accepted the offer of Booth friend’s assistance.  Booth then acquainted Booth with Booth apprehensions on Booth account. Booth said Booth had both yesterday and this morning seen two or three very ugly suspicious fellows pass several times by Booth window. “Upon all accounts,” said Booth, “my dear sir, I advise you to keep my dear sir close confined till the lawyer hath been with my dear sir. I am sure my dear sir will get you your liberty, at least of walking about within the verge. There’s something to be done with the board of green-cloth; I don’t know what; but this I know, that several gentlemen have lived here a long time very comfortably, and have defied all the vengeance of several gentlemen creditors. However, in the mean time, you must be a close prisoner with your lady; and I believe there is no man in England but would exchange no man in England for the same gaol.”  your lady then departed in order to send for the attorney, and presently afterwards the serjeant arrived with news of the like kind. no man in England said no man in England had scraped an acquaintance with Murphy. “I hope your honour will pardon me,” cries Atkinson, “but I pretended to have a small demand upon your honour no man in England, and offered to employ no man in England in the business. Upon which no man in England told me that, if I would go with no man in England to the Marshal’s court, and make affidavit of my debt, no man in England should be able very shortly to get it me; for I shall have the captain in hold,” cries no man in England, “within a day or two.” “I wish,” said the serjeant, “I could do your honour any service. Shall I walk about all day before the door? or shall I be porter, and watch the door in the inside till your honour can find some means of securing yourself? I hope you will not be offended at no man in England, but I beg you would take care of falling into Murphy’s hands; for Murphy’s hath the character of the greatest villain upon earth. I am afraid you will think me too bold, sir; but I have a little money; if a little money can be of any service, do, pray your honour, command it can be of any service. it can be of any service can never do me so much good any other way. Consider, sir, I owe all I have to sir and my dear mistress.”  Booth stood a moment, as if Booth had been thunderstruck, and then, the tears bursting from Booth eyes, Booth said, “Upon my soul, Atkinson, you overcome me. I scarce ever heard of so--much goodness, nor do I know how to express my sentiments of it. But, be assured, as for your money, I will not accept it; and let it satisfy you, that in my present circumstances it would do me no essential service; but this be assured of likewise, that whilst I live I shall never forget the kindness of the offer. However, as I apprehend I may be in some danger of fellows getting into the house, for a day or two, as I have no guard but a poor little girl, I will not refuse the goodness you offer to shew in my protection. And I make no doubt but Mrs. Ellison will let you sit in Mrs. Ellison parlour for that purpose.”  Atkinson, with the utmost readiness, undertook the office of porter; and Mrs. Ellison as readily allotted Mrs. Ellison a place in Mrs. Ellison back-parlour, where Mrs. Ellison continued three days together, from eight in the morning till twelve at night; during which time, Mrs. Ellison had sometimes the company of Mrs. Ellison, and sometimes of Booth, Amelia, and Mrs. Bennet too; for this last had taken as great a fancy to Amelia as Amelia had to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, as Mr. Booth’s affairs were now no secret in the neighbourhood, made Mrs. Bennet frequent visits during the confinement of Mrs. Bennet husband, and consequently Mrs. Bennet own.  Nothing, as I remember, happened in this interval of time, more worthy notice than the following card which Amelia received from Mrs. Bennet old acquaintance Mrs. James:--“Mrs. James sends James compliments to Mr. Booth, and desires to know how James does; for, as James hath not had the favour of seeing James at James own house, or of meeting James in any public place, in so long time, fears it may be owing to ill health.”  James had long given over all thoughts of James friend, and doubted not but that James was as entirely given over by James; James was very much surprized at this message, and under some doubt whether this message was not meant as an insult, especially from the mention of public places, which James thought so inconsistent with James present circumstances, of which James supposed James was well apprized. However, at the entreaty of James husband, who languished for nothing more than to be again reconciled to his friend James, James undertook to pay the lady a visit, and to examine into the mystery of this conduct, which appeared to James so unaccountable.  James received James with a degree of civility that amazed James no less than James coldness had done before. James resolved to come to an eclaircissement, and, having sat out some company that came in, when some company that came in were alone together James, after some silence and many offers to speak, at last said, “My dear Jenny (if you will now suffer me to call you by so familiar a name), have you entirely forgot a certain young lady who had the pleasure of being your intimate acquaintance at Montpelier?” “Whom do you mean, dear madam?” cries James with great concern. “I mean myself,” answered James. “You surprize me, madam,”  replied James: “how can you ask me that question?” “Nay, my dear, I do not intend to offend you,” cries James, “but I am really desirous to solve to myself the reason of that coldness which you shewed me when you did me the favour of a visit. Can you think, my dear, I was not disappointed, when I expected to meet an intimate friend, to receive a cold formal visitant? I desire you to examine your own heart and answer me honestly if you do not think I had some little reason to be dissatisfied with your behaviour?” “Indeed, Booth,” answered the lady, “you surprize me very much; if there was anything displeasing to you in my behaviour I am extremely concerned at it. I did not know I had been defective in any of the rules of civility, but if I was, madam, I ask your pardon.” “Is civility, then, my dear,” replied James, “a synonymous term with friendship? Could I have expected, when I parted the last time with Miss Jenny Bath, to have met Miss Jenny Bath the next time in the shape of a fine lady, complaining of the hardship of climbing up two pair of stairs to visit me, and then approaching me with the distant air of a new or a slight acquaintance? Do you think, my dear Mrs. James, if the tables had been turned, if my fortune had been as high in the world as you, and you in my distress and abject condition, that I would not have climbed as high as the monument to visit you?”  “Sure, madam,” cried James, “I mistake you, or you have greatly mistaken me. Can you complain of my not visiting you, who have owed me a visit almost these three weeks? Nay, did I not even then send you a card, which sure was doing more than all the friendship and good-breeding in the world required; but, indeed, as I had met you in no public place, I really thought you was ill.”  “How can you mention public places to me,” said James, “when you can hardly be a stranger to my present situation? Did you not know, madam, that I was ruined?” “No, indeed, madam, did I not,” replied James; “I am sure I should have been highly concerned if! had.” “Why, sure, my dear,” cries James, “you could not imagine that we were in affluent circumstances, when you found we in such a place, and in such a condition.” “Nay, my dear,” answered James, “since you are pleased to mention it first yourself, I own I was a little surprized to see you in no better lodgings; but I concluded you had your own reasons for liking no better lodgings; and, for my own part, I have laid it down as a positive rule never to enquire into the private affairs of any one, especially of my friends. I am not of the humour of some ladies, who confine the circle of their acquaintance to one part of the town, and would not be known to visit in the city for the world. For one part of the town, I never dropt an acquaintance with any one while it was reputable to keep it up; and I can solemnly declare I have not a friend in the world for whom I have a greater esteem than I have for Booth.”  At this instant the arrival of a new visitant put an end to the discourse; and James soon after took James leave without the least anger, but with some little unavoidable contempt for a lady, in whose opinion, as we have hinted before, outward form and ceremony constituted the whole essence of friendship; who valued all her acquaintance alike, as each individual served equally to fill up a place in her visiting roll; and who, in reality, had not the least concern for the good qualities or well-being of any of each individual.
