 _Continuation of Mrs. Bennet’s story._   “I think, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, “I told you my father promised me to enquire farther into the affair, but my father had hardly time to keep my father word; for we separated pretty late in the evening and early the next morning my father was married to the widow.
“But, though my father gave no credit to my information, I had sufficient reason to think my father did not forget it, by the resentment which my father soon discovered to both the persons whom I had named as my informers.
“Nor was it long before I had good cause to believe that my father new wife was perfectly well acquainted with the good opinion I had of my father’s new wife, not only from my father’s new wife usage of me, but from certain hints which my father’s new wife threw forth with an air of triumph.
One day, particularly, I remember my father’s new wife said to my father, upon my father mentioning my father age, ‘O, my dear!
I hope you have many years yet to live!
unless, indeed, I should be so cruel as to break your heart’ my father’s new wife spoke these words looking me full in the face, and accompanied these words with a sneer in which the highest malice was visible, under a thin covering of affected pleasantry.
“I will not entertain you, madam, with anything so common as the cruel usage of a step-mother; nor of what affected me much more, the unkind behaviour of a father under such an influence.
It shall suffice only to tell you that I had the mortification to perceive the gradual and daily decrease of my father affection.
my father smiles were converted into frowns; the tender appellations of child and dear were exchanged for plain Molly, that girl, that creature, and sometimes much harder names.
I was at first turned all at once into a cypher, and at last seemed to be considered as a nuisance in the family.
“Thus altered was the man of whom I gave you such a character at the entrance on my story; but, alas!
he no longer acted from he own excellent disposition, but was in everything governed and directed by my mother-in-law.
In fact, whenever there is great disparity of years between husband and wife, the younger is, I believe, always possessed of absolute power over the elder; for superstition itself is a less firm support of absolute power than dotage.
“But, though he wife was so entirely mistress of my father will that his wife could make he use me ill, his wife could not so perfectly subdue he understanding as to prevent he from being conscious of such ill-usage; and from this consciousness, he began inveterately to hate me.
Of this hatred he gave me numberless instances, and I protest to you I know not any other reason for it than what I have assigned; and the cause, as experience hath convinced me, is adequate to the effect.
“While I was in this wretched situation, my father’s unkindness having almost broken ray heart, my father came one day into my room with more anger in my father countenance than I had ever seen, and, after bitterly upbraiding me with my undutiful behaviour both to my father and my father worthy consort, my father bid me pack up my alls, and immediately prepare to quit my father house; at the same time gave me a letter, and told me that would acquaint me where I might find a home; adding that my father doubted not but I expected, and had indeed solicited, the invitation; and left me with a declaration that my father would have no spies in my father family.
“a letter, I found on opening a letter, was from my father own sister; but before I mention the contents I will give you a short sketch of my father’s own sister character, as it was somewhat particular.
my father’s own sister personal charms were not great; for my father’s own sister was very tall, very thin, and very homely.
Of the defect of my father’s own sister beauty my father’s own sister was, perhaps, sensible; my father’s own sister vanity, therefore, retreated into my father’s own sister mind, where there is no looking-glass, and consequently where we can flatter we with discovering almost whatever beauties we please.
This is an encouraging circumstance; and yet I have observed, dear Mrs. Booth, that few women ever seek these comforts from within till few women are driven to it by despair of finding any food for few women vanity from without.
Indeed, I believe the first wish of our whole sex is to be handsome.”  Here both the ladies fixed the ladies eyes on the glass, and both smiled.
“My aunt, however,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “from despair of gaining any applause this way, had applied My aunt entirely to the contemplation of My aunt understanding, and had improved this to such a pitch, that at the age of fifty, at which My aunt was now arrived, My aunt had contracted a hearty contempt for much the greater part of both sexes; for the women, as being idiots, and for the men, as the admirers of idiots.
That word, and fool, were almost constantly in My aunt mouth, and were bestowed with great liberality among all My aunt acquaintance.
“My aunt had spent one day only at my father’s house in near two years; it was about a month before his second marriage.
At My aunt departure My aunt took occasion to whisper me My aunt opinion of the widow, whom My aunt called a pretty idiot, and wondered how My aunt brother could bear such company under her brother roof; for neither My aunt nor I had at that time any suspicion of what afterwards happened.
“The letter which my father had just received, and which was the first My aunt had sent my father since my father marriage, was of such a nature that I should be unjust if I blamed my father for being offended; fool and idiot were both plentifully bestowed in it as well on my father as on my father wife.
But what, perhaps, had principally offended my father was that part which related to me; for, after much panegyric on my understanding, and saying my father was unworthy of such a daughter, such a daughter considered my father match not only as the highest indiscretion as it related to my father, but as a downright act of injustice to me.
One expression in it I shall never forget.
‘You have placed,’ said such a daughter, ‘a woman above your daughter, who, in understanding, the only valuable gift of nature, is the lowest in the whole class of pretty idiots.’ After much more of this kind, it concluded with inviting me to such a daughter house.
“I can truly say that when I had read the letter I entirely forgave my father’s suspicion that I had made some complaints to my aunt of my father behaviour; for, though I was indeed innocent, there was surely colour enough to suspect the contrary.
“Though I had never been greatly attached to my aunt, nor indeed had my aunt formerly given me any reason for such an attachment, yet I was well enough pleased with my aunt present invitation.
To say the truth, I led so wretched a life where I then was, that it was impossible not to be a gainer by any exchange.
“I could not, however, bear the thoughts of leaving my father with an impression on my father mind against me which I did not deserve.
I endeavoured, therefore, to remove all my father suspicion of my having complained to my aunt by the most earnest asseverations of my innocence; but all his suspicion of my having complained to my aunt by the most earnest asseverations of my innocence were all to no purpose.
All my tears, all my vows, and all my entreaties were fruitless.
My new mother, indeed, appeared to be my advocate; but My new mother acted My new mother part very poorly, and, far from counterfeiting any desire of succeeding in my suit, My new mother could not conceal the excessive joy which My new mother felt on the occasion.
“Well, madam, the next day I departed for my aunt’s, where, after a long journey of forty miles, I arrived, without having once broke my fast on the road; for grief is as capable as food of filling the stomach, and I had too much of the former to admit any of the latter.
The fatigue of my journey, and the agitation of my mind, joined to my fasting, so overpowered my spirits, that when I was taken from my horse I immediately fainted away in the arms of the man who helped me from my saddle.
my aunt expressed great astonishment at seeing me in this condition, with my eyes almost swollen out of my head with tears; but my father’s letter, which I delivered my aunt soon after I came to myself, pretty well, I believe, cured my aunt surprize.
my aunt often smiled with a mixture of contempt and anger while my aunt was reading it; and, having pronounced my aunt brother to be a fool, my aunt turned to myself, and, with as much affability as possible (for my aunt is no great mistress of affability), said, ‘Don’t be uneasy, my aunt, for my aunt are come to the house of a friend--of one who hath sense enough to discern the author of all the mischief: depend upon it, child, I will, ere long, make some people ashamed of some people folly.’ This kind reception gave me some comfort, my aunt assuring me that my aunt would convince my aunt how unjustly my aunt had accused me of having made any complaints to my aunt.
A paper war was now begun between these two, which not only fixed an irreconcileable hatred between them, but confirmed my father’s displeasure against me; and, in the end, I believe, did me no service with my aunt; for I was considered by both as the cause of both dissension, though, in fact, my stepmother, who very well knew the affection my aunt had for my aunt, had long since done my aunt business with my father; and as for my aunt’s affection towards my father, it had been abating several years, from an apprehension that he did not pay sufficient deference to my aunt understanding.
“I had lived about half a year with my aunt when I heard of my stepmother’s being delivered of a boy, and the great joy my father expressed on that occasion; but, poor man, my father lived not long to enjoy my father happiness; for within a month afterwards I had the melancholy news of my father death.
“Notwithstanding all the disobligations I had lately received from my father, I was sincerely afflicted at my loss of my father.
All my father kindness to me in my infancy, all my father kindness to me while I was growing up, recurred to my memory, raised a thousand tender, melancholy ideas, and totally obliterated all thoughts of my father latter behaviour, for which I made also every allowance and every excuse in my power.
“But what may perhaps appear more extraordinary, my aunt began soon to speak of my father with concern.
my aunt said my father had some understanding formerly, though my father passion for that vile woman had, in a great measure, obscured a great measure; and one day, when my aunt was in an ill-humour with my aunt, my aunt had the cruelty to throw out a hint that my aunt had never quarrelled with her brother if it had not been on my account.” my father, during my father life, had allowed my aunt very handsomely for my board; for generosity was too deeply riveted in my father nature to be plucked out by all the power of his wife.
So far, however, my aunt prevailed, that, though my father died possessed of upwards of L2000, my father left me no more than L100, which, as my father expressed in my father will, was to set me up in some business, if I had the grace to take to any.
“Hitherto my aunt had in general treated me with some degree of affection; but my aunt behaviour began now to be changed.
my aunt soon took an opportunity of giving me to understand that my aunt fortune was insufficient to keep me; and, as I could not live on the interest of my own, it was high time for me to consider about going into the world.
my aunt added, that her brother having mentioned my setting up in some business in his will was very foolish; that I had been bred to nothing; and, besides, that the sum was too trifling to set me up in any way of reputation; my aunt desired me therefore to think of immediately going into service.
“This advice was perhaps right enough; and I told my aunt I was very ready to do as my aunt directed me, but I was at that time in an ill state of health; I desired my aunt therefore to let me stay with my aunt till my legacy, which was not to be paid till a year after my father’s death, was due; and I then promised to satisfy my aunt for my board, to which my aunt readily consented.
“And now, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, sighing, “I am going to open to you those matters which lead directly to that great catastrophe of my life which hath occasioned my giving you this trouble, and of trying your patience in this manner.”  Amelia, notwithstanding Amelia impatience, made a very civil answer to this; and then Mrs. Bennet proceeded to relate what is written in the next chapter.
