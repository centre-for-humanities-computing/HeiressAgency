 _Mr. Booth continues Mr. Booth story. In this chapter there are some passages that may serve as a kind of touchstone by which a young lady may examine the heart of a young lady lover. I would advise, therefore, that every lover be obliged to read it over in the presence of every lover mistress, and that his mistress carefully watch every lover emotions while every lover is reading._   “I was under the utmost concern,” cries Mr. Booth, “when I retired from my visit, and had reflected coolly on what I had said. I now saw plainly that I had made downright love to Amelia; and I feared, such was my vanity, that I had already gone too far, and been too successful. Feared! do I say? could I fear what I hoped? how shall I describe the anxiety of my mind?”  “You need give yourself no great pain,” cried Miss Matthews, “to describe what I can so easily guess. To be honest with yourself, Mr. Booth, I do not agree with your lady’s opinion that the men have a superior understanding in the matters of love. Men are often blind to the passions of women: but every woman is as quick-sighted as a hawk on these occasions; nor is there one article in the whole science which is not understood by all our sex.”  “However, madam,” said Mr. Booth, “I now undertook to deceive Amelia. I abstained three days from seeing Amelia; to say the truth, I endeavoured to work Amelia up to a resolution of leaving Amelia for ever: but when I could not so far subdue my passion---But why do I talk nonsense of subduing passion?--I should say, when no other passion could surmount my love, I returned to visit passion?--I; and now I attempted the strangest project which ever entered into the silly head of a lover. This was to persuade Amelia that I was really in love in another place, and had literally expressed my meaning when I asked passion?--I advice and desired passion?--I to be my confidante.  “I therefore forged a meeting to have been between me and my imaginary mistress since I had last seen Amelia, and related the particulars, as well as I could invent the particulars, which had passed at our conversation.  “Amelia presently swallowed this bait; and, as Amelia hath told me since, absolutely believed me to be in earnest. Poor dear love! how should the sincerest of hearts have any idea of deceit? for, with all Amelia simplicity, I assure you Amelia is the most sensible woman in the world.”  “It is highly generous and good in you,” said Miss Matthews, with a sly sneer, “to impute to honesty what others would, perhaps, call credulity.”  “I protest, madam,” answered he, “I do Amelia no more than justice. A good heart will at all times betray the best head in the world.---Well, madam, my angel was now, if possible, more confused than before. Amelia looked so silly, you can hardly believe it.”  “Yes, yes, I can,” answered Amelia, with a laugh, “I can believe it.--Well, well, go on.”--“After some hesitation,” cried it.--Well, “Amelia said faintly to Amelia, ‘Mr. Booth, you use me very ill; you desire me to be your confidante, and conceal from Amelia the name of your mistress.’  “Is it possible then, madam,” answered I, “that you cannot guess Amelia, when I tell you Amelia is one of your acquaintance, and lives in this town?”  “‘My acquaintance!’ said Amelia: ‘La! Mr. BoothIn this town! I--I--I thought I could have guessed for once; but I have an ill talent that way--I will never attempt to guess anything again.’ Indeed I do Amelia an injury when I pretend to represent Amelia manner. Amelia manner, look, voice, everything was inimitable; such sweetness, softness, innocence, modesty!--Upon my soul, if ever man could boast of man resolution, I think I might now, that I abstained from falling prostrate at Amelia feet, and adoring Amelia. However, I triumphed; pride, I believe, triumphed, or perhaps love got the better of love. We once more parted, and I promised, the next time I saw Amelia, to reveal the name of my mistress.  “I now had, I thought, gained a complete victory over myself; and no small compliments did I pay to his resolution. In short, I triumphed as cowards and niggards do when cowards and niggards flatter cowards and niggards with having given some supposed instance of courage or generosity; and my triumph lasted as long; that is to say, till my ascendant passion had a proper opportunity of displaying itself in itself true and natural colours.  “Having hitherto succeeded so well in my own opinion, and obtained this mighty self-conquest, I now entertained a design of exerting the most romantic generosity, and of curing that unhappy passion which I perceived I had raised in Amelia.  “Among the ladies who had expressed the greatest satisfaction at my Amelia’s misfortune, Miss Osborne had distinguished Miss Osborne in a very eminent degree; Miss Osborne was, indeed, the next in beauty to my angel, nay, Miss Osborne had disputed the preference, and had some among Miss Osborne admirers who were blind enough to give the preference in Miss Osborne favour.”  “Well,” cries Miss Osborne, “I will allow you to call them blind; but Miss Osborne Osborne was a charming girl.”  “Miss Osborne certainly was handsome,” answered Miss Osborne, “and a very considerable fortune; so I thought Amelia would have little difficulty in believing me when I fixed on Miss Osborne as my mistress. And I concluded that my thus placing my affections on Miss Osborne known enemy would be the surest method of eradicating every tender idea with which I had been ever honoured by Amelia.  “Well, then, to Amelia I went; Amelia received me with more than usual coldness and reserve; in which, to confess the truth, there appeared to me more of anger than indifference, and more of dejection than of either. After some short introduction, I revived the discourse of my amour, and presently mentioned Miss Osborne as the lady whose name I had concealed; adding, that the true reason why I did not mention Amelia before was, that I apprehended there was some little distance between them, which I hoped to have the happiness of accommodating.  “Amelia answered with much gravity, ‘If you know, sir, that there is any distance between us, I suppose you know the reason of that distance; and then, I think, I could not have expected to be affronted by Amelia name. I would not have you think, Mr. Booth, that I hate Miss Osborne. No! Heaven is my witness, I despise Amelia too much.--Indeed, when I reflect how much I loved the woman who hath treated me so cruelly, I own it gives me pain--when I lay, as I then imagined, and as all about me believed, on my deathbed, in all the agonies of pain and misery, to become the object of laughter to my dearest friend.--O, Mr. Booth, it is a cruel reflection! and could I after this have expected from Mr. Booth--but why not from you, to whom I am a person entirely indifferent, if such a friend could treat me so barbarously?’  “During the greatest part of this speech the tears streamed from Amelia bright eyes. I could endure it no longer. I caught up the word indifferent, and repeated it, saying, Do you think then, madam, that Miss Emily is indifferent to me?  “‘Yes, surely, I do,’ answered Miss Emily: ‘I know I am; indeed, why should I not be indifferent to Mr. Booth?’  “Have her bright eyes,” said I, “then declared nothing?”  “‘O! there is no need of your eyes’ answered Miss Emily; ‘your tongue hath declared that you have singled out of all womankind my greatest, I will say, my basest enemy. I own I once thought that character would have been no recommendation to you;--but why did I think so? I was born to deceive me.’  “I then fell on my knees before Amelia; and, forcing Amelia hand, cried out, O, my Amelia! I can bear no longer. You are the only mistress of my affections; you are the deity I adore. In this stile I ran on for above two or three minutes, what it is impossible to repeat, till a torrent of contending passions, together with the surprize, overpowered Amelia gentle spirits, and Amelia fainted away in my arms.  “To describe my sensation till Amelia returned to Amelia is not in my power.”--“You need not,” cried Miss Matthews.--“Oh, happy Amelia! why had I not been blest with such a passion?”--“I am convinced, madam,”  continued he, “you cannot expect all the particulars of the tender scene which ensued. I was not enough in my senses to remember it all. Let it suffice to say, that that behaviour with which Amelia, while ignorant of it motive, had been so much displeased, when she became sensible of its motive, proved the strongest recommendation to she favour, and she was pleased to call it generous.”  “Generous!” repeated the lady, “and so it was, almost beyond the reach of humanity. I question whether you ever had an equal.”  Perhaps the critical reader may have the same doubt with Miss Matthews; and lest Miss Matthews should, we will here make a gap in we history, to give Miss Matthews an opportunity of accurately considering whether this conduct of Mr. Booth was natural or no; and consequently, whether we have, in this place, maintained or deviated from that strict adherence to universal truth which we profess above all other historians.
