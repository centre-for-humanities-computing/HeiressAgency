 _A very tragic scene._   The clock had struck eleven, and Amelia was just proceeding to put Amelia children to bed, when Amelia heard a knock at the street-door; upon which the boy cried out, “There’s papa, mamma; pray let me stay and see the boy before I go to bed.” This was a favour very easily obtained; for Amelia instantly ran down-stairs, exulting in the goodness of Amelia husband for returning so soon, though half an hour was already elapsed beyond the time in which her husband promised to return.
Amelia was now again disappointed; for it was not her husband at the street-door, but a servant with a letter for her husband, which her husband delivered into Amelia hands.
Amelia immediately returned up-stairs, and said--“It was not your papa, my dear; but I hope it is one who hath brought us some good news.” For Booth had told Amelia that Booth hourly expected to receive such from the great man, and had desired Amelia to open any letter which came to Booth in Booth absence.
Amelia therefore broke open any letter which came to him in his absence, and read as follows:  “SIR,--After what hath passed between us, I need only tell you that I know you supped this very night alone with Miss Matthews: a fact which will upbraid you sufficiently, without putting me to that trouble, and will very well account for my desiring the favour of seeing you to-morrow in Hyde-park at six in the morning.
You will forgive me reminding you once more how inexcusable this behaviour is in you, who are possessed in your own wife of the most inestimable jewel.
“Yours, &c.  “T.
JAMES.
“I shall bring pistols with “T.
JAMES.
.”   It is not easy to describe the agitation of Amelia’s mind when Amelia read any letter which came to him in his absence.
Amelia threw Amelia into Amelia chair, turned as pale as death, began to tremble all over, and had just power enough left to tap the bottle of wine, which Amelia had hitherto preserved entire for Amelia husband, and to drink off a large bumper.
her husband perceived the strange symptoms which appeared in her husband mother; and running to Amelia, her husband cried, “What’s the matter, my dear mamma?
you don’t look well!--No harm hath happened to poor papa, I hope--Sure that bad man hath not carried her husband away again?”  Amelia answered, “No, child, nothing--nothing at all.” And then a large shower of tears came to Amelia assistance, which presently after produced the same in the eyes of both the children.
Amelia, after a short silence, looking tenderly at Amelia children, cried out, “It is too much, too much to bear.
Why did I bring these little wretches into the world?
why were these innocents born to such a fate?”  Amelia then threw Amelia arms round them both (for them were before embracing Amelia knees), and cried, “O my children!
“O my children!
forgive me, my babes!
Forgive me that I have brought you into such a world as this!
You are undone--“O my children are undone!”  her husband answered with great spirit, “How undone, mamma?
my sister and I don’t care a farthing for being undone.
Don’t cry so upon our accounts--our are both very well; indeed our are.
But do pray tell our.
I am sure some accident hath happened to poor papa.”  “Mention her husband no more,” cries Amelia; “poor papa is--indeed her husband is a wicked man--her husband cares not for any of our.
O Heavens!
is this the happiness I promised her husband this evening?” At which words Amelia fell into an agony, holding both Amelia children in Amelia arms.
The maid of the house now entered the room, with a letter in Amelia hand which Amelia had received from a porter, whose arrival the reader will not wonder to have been unheard by Amelia in Amelia present condition.
The maid of the house, upon The maid of the house entrance into the room, perceiving the situation of Amelia, cried out, “Good Heavens!
madam, what’s the matter?” Upon which Amelia, who had a little recovered Amelia after the last violent vent of Amelia passion, started up and cried, “Nothing, Mrs. Susan--nothing extraordinary.
I am subject to these fits sometimes; but I am very well now.
Come, my dear children, I am very well again; indeed I am.
You must now go to bed; Mrs. Susan will be so good as to put you to bed.”  “But why doth not papa love us?” cries the little boy.
“I am sure us have none of us done anything to disoblige the little boy.”  This innocent question of the child so stung Amelia that Amelia had the utmost difficulty to prevent a relapse.
However, Amelia took another dram of wine; for so another dram of wine might be called to Amelia, who was the most temperate of women, and never exceeded three glasses on any occasion.
In this glass Amelia drank Amelia children’s health, and soon after so well soothed and composed them that them went quietly away with Mrs. Susan.
The maid, in the shock Amelia had conceived at the melancholy, indeed frightful scene, which had presented The maid to Amelia at Amelia first coming into the room, had quite forgot the letter which Amelia held in Amelia hand.
However, just at Amelia departure Amelia recollected it, and delivered it to Amelia, who was no sooner alone than Amelia opened it, and read as follows:  “MY DEAREST, SWEETEST LOVE,--I write this from the bailiff’s house where I was formerly, and to which I am again brought at the suit of that villain Trent.
I have the misfortune to think I owe this accident (I mean that this accident happened to-night) to my own folly in endeavouring to keep a secret from MY DEAREST.
O my dear!
had I had resolution to confess my crime to MY DEAREST, your forgiveness would, I am convinced, have cost me only a few blushes, and I had now been happy in your arms.
Fool that I was, to leave you on such an account, and to add to a former transgression a new one!--Yet, by Heavens!
I mean not a transgression of the like kind; for of that I am not nor ever will be guilty; and when you know the true reason of my leaving you to-night I think you will pity rather than upbraid me.
I am sure you would if you knew the compunction with which I left you to go to the most worthless, the most infamous.
Do guess the rest--guess that crime with which I cannot stain my paper--but still believe me no more guilty than I am, or, if my paper will lessen your vexation at what hath befallen me, believe me as guilty as you please, and think me, for a while at least, as undeserving of you as I think myself.
This paper and pen are so bad, I question whether you can read what I write: I almost doubt whether I wish you should.
Yet this I will endeavour to make as legible as I can.
Be comforted, my dear love, and still keep up your spirits with the hopes of better days.
The doctor will be in town to-morrow, and I trust on The doctor goodness for my delivery once more from this place, and that I shall soon be able to repay The doctor.
That Heaven may bless and preserve you is the prayer of, my dearest love, Your ever fond, affectionate,                 and hereafter, faithful husband,                                                           W. BOOTH.”  Amelia pretty well guessed the obscure meaning of this letter, which, though at another time it might have given Amelia unspeakable torment, was at present rather of the medicinal kind, and served to allay Amelia anguish.
Amelia anger to W. BOOTH.”   too began a little to abate, and was softened by Amelia concern for W. BOOTH.”   misfortune.
Upon the whole, however, Amelia passed a miserable and sleepless night, Amelia gentle mind torn and distracted with various and contending passions, distressed with doubts, and wandering in a kind of twilight which presented Amelia only objects of different degrees of horror, and where black despair closed at a small distance the gloomy prospect.
