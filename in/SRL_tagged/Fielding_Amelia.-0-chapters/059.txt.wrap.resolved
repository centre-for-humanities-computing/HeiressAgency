 _Containing a very strange incident._   When the husband and wife were alone the husband and wife again talked over the news which the serjeant had brought; on which occasion Amelia did all Amelia could to conceal Amelia own fears, and to quiet those of Amelia husband. At last Amelia turned the conversation to another subject, and poor Mrs. Bennet was brought on the carpet. “I should be sorry,” cries Amelia, “to find I had conceived an affection for a bad woman; and yet I begin to fear poor Mrs. Bennet knows something of poor Mrs. Bennet more than poor Mrs. Bennet cares to discover; why else should poor Mrs. Bennet be unwilling to be seen with poor Mrs. Bennet in public? Besides, I have observed that Mrs. Ellison hath been always backward to introduce poor Mrs. Bennet to me, nor would ever bring poor Mrs. Bennet to my apartment, though I have often desired poor Mrs. Bennet. Nay, poor Mrs. Bennet hath given me frequent hints not to cultivate the acquaintance. What do you think, my dear? I should be very sorry to contract an intimacy with a wicked person.”  “Nay, my dear,” cries Booth. “I know no more of poor Mrs. Bennet, nor indeed hardly so much as yourself. But this I think, that if poor Mrs. Bennet knows any reason why poor Mrs. Bennet should not have introduced poor Mrs. Bennet into your company, poor Mrs. Bennet was very much in the wrong in introducing poor Mrs. Bennet into it.”  In discourses of this kind they past the remainder of the evening. In the morning Booth rose early, and, going down-stairs, received from little Betty a sealed note, which contained the following words:       Beware, beware, beware;      For I apprehend a dreadful snare      Is laid for virtuous innocence,      Under a friend’s false pretence.  Booth immediately enquired of the girl who brought this note? and was told this note came by a chair-man, who, having delivered this note, departed without saying a word.  Booth was extremely staggered at what Booth read, and presently referred the advice to the same affair on which Booth had received those hints from Atkinson the preceding evening; but when Booth came to consider the words more maturely Booth could not so well reconcile the two last lines of this poetical epistle, if it may be so called, with any danger which the law gave Booth reason to apprehend. Mr. Murphy and Booth gang could not well be said to attack either Booth innocence or virtue; nor did Mr. Murphy and his gang attack Booth under any colour or pretence of friendship.  After much deliberation on this matter a very strange suspicion came into Booth head; and this was, that Mrs. Ellison. Booth had, for some time, conceived no very high opinion of that good gentlewoman, and Booth now began to suspect that Mrs. Ellison was bribed to betray Booth. By this means Booth thought Booth could best account for the strange appearance of the supposed madman. And when this conceit once had birth in Booth mind, several circumstances nourished and improved it. Among these were Mrs. Ellison jocose behaviour and raillery on that occasion, and Mrs. Ellison attempt to ridicule Booth fears from the message which the serjeant had brought Booth.  a very strange suspicion was indeed preposterous, and not at all warranted by, or even consistent with, the character and whole behaviour of Mrs. Ellison, but a very strange suspicion was the only one which at that time suggested a very strange suspicion to his mind; and, however blameable it might be, it was certainly not unnatural in his to entertain it; for so great a torment is anxiety to the human mind, that we always endeavour to relieve we from it by guesses, however doubtful or uncertain; on all which occasions, dislike and hatred are the surest guides to lead we suspicion to a very strange suspicion object.  When Mrs. Ellison rose to breakfast, Booth produced the note which Booth had received, saying, “My dear, you have so often blamed me for keeping secrets from you, and I have so often, indeed, endeavoured to conceal secrets of this kind from you with such ill success, that I think I shall never more attempt it.” Mrs. Ellison read the letter hastily, and seemed not a little discomposed; then, turning to Booth with a very disconsolate countenance, Mrs. Ellison said, “Sure fortune takes a delight in terrifying us! what can be the meaning of this?” Then, fixing Mrs. Ellison eyes attentively on the paper, Mrs. Ellison perused the paper for some time, till Booth cried, “How is the paper possible, my Emily, you can read such stuff patiently? the verses are certainly as bad as ever were written.”--“I was trying, My dear,” answered Mrs. Ellison, “to recollect the hand; for I will take my oath I have seen it before, and that very lately;” and suddenly Mrs. Ellison cried out, with great emotion, “I remember it perfectly now; it is Mrs. Bennet’s hand. Mrs. Ellison shewed me a letter from Mrs. Ellison but a day or two ago. It is a very remarkable hand, and I am positive It is hers.”  “If it be hers,” cries Booth, “what can Mrs. Ellison possibly mean by the latter part of Mrs. Ellison caution? sure Mrs. Ellison hath no intention to betray us.”  “I know not what Mrs. Ellison means,” answered Amelia, “but I am resolved to know immediately, for I am certain of the hand. By the greatest luck in the world, Mrs. Ellison told me yesterday where Mrs. Ellison lodgings were, when Mrs. Ellison pressed me exceedingly to come and see Mrs. Ellison. Mrs. Ellison lives but a very few doors from us, and I will go to Mrs. Ellison this moment.”  Booth made not the least objection to Booth wife’s design. Booth curiosity was, indeed, as great as hers, and so was Booth impatience to satisfy it, though Booth mentioned not this Booth impatience to Amelia; and perhaps it had been well for Booth if Booth had.  Amelia, therefore, presently equipped Amelia in Amelia walking dress, and, leaving Amelia children to the care of Amelia husband, made all possible haste to Mrs. Bennet’s lodgings.  Amelia waited near five minutes at Mrs. Bennet’s door before any one came to open any one; at length a maid servant appeared, who, being asked if Bennet was at home, answered, with some confusion in Bennet countenance, that Bennet did not know; “but, madam,” said Bennet, “if you will send up your name, I will go and see.” Amelia then told Bennet name, and the wench, after staying a considerable time, returned and acquainted Bennet that Mrs. Bennet was at home. Bennet was then ushered into a parlour and told that the lady would wait on Bennet presently.  In a parlour Amelia cooled Bennet heels, as the phrase is, near a quarter of an hour. Bennet seemed, indeed, at this time, in the miserable situation of one of those poor wretches who make their morning visits to the great to solicit favours, or perhaps to solicit the payment of a debt, for both are alike treated as beggars, and the latter sometimes considered as the more troublesome beggars of the two.  During Bennet stay here, Amelia observed the house to be in great confusion; a great bustle was heard above-stairs, and the maid ran up and down several times in a great hurry.  At length Bennet came in. Bennet was greatly disordered in Bennet looks, and had, as the women call it, huddled on Bennet cloaths in much haste; for, in truth, Bennet was in bed when Amelia first came. Of this fact Bennet informed Bennet, as the only apology Bennet could make for having caused Bennet to wait so long for Bennet company.  Amelia very readily accepted the only apology she could make for having caused her to wait so long for her company, but asked Bennet with a smile, if these early hours were usual with Bennet? Bennet turned as red as scarlet at the question, and answered, “No, indeed, dear madam. I am for the most part a very early riser; but I happened accidentally to sit up very late last night. I am sure I had little expectation of your intending me such a favour this morning.”  Amelia, looking very steadfastly at Bennet, said, “Is it possible, madam, you should think such a note as this would raise no curiosity in me?”  Bennet then gave Bennet the note, asking Bennet if Bennet did not know the hand.  Bennet appeared in the utmost surprize and confusion at this instant. Indeed, if Amelia had conceived but the slightest suspicion before, the behaviour of the lady would have been a sufficient confirmation to the lady of the truth. the lady waited not, therefore, for an answer, which, indeed, the other seemed in no haste to give, but conjured the lady in the most earnest manner to explain to the lady the meaning of so extraordinary an act of friendship; “for so,” said the lady, “I esteem it, being convinced you must have sufficient reason for the warning you have given me.”  Bennet, after some hesitation, answered, “I need not, I believe, tell you how much I am surprized at what you have shewn me; and the chief reason of my surprize is, how you came to discover my hand. Sure, madam, you have not shewn it to poor Mrs. Bennet?”  Amelia declared Amelia had not, but desired Amelia would question Amelia no farther. “What signifies how I discovered it, since my hand it certainly is?”  “I own it is,” cries Mrs. Bennet, recovering Mrs. Bennet spirits, “and since you have not shewn it to Amelia I am satisfied. I begin to guess now whence you might have your information; but no matter; I wish I had never done anything of which I ought to be more ashamed. No one can, I think, justly accuse me of a crime on that account; and I thank Heaven my shame will never be directed by the false opinion of the world. Perhaps it was wrong to shew my letter, but when I consider all circumstances I can forgive it.”  “Since you have guessed the truth,” said Amelia, “I am not obliged to deny it. Amelia, indeed, shewed me your letter, but I am sure you have not the least reason to be ashamed of your letter. On the contrary, your behaviour on so melancholy an occasion was highly praiseworthy; and your bearing up under such afflictions as the loss of a husband in so dreadful a situation was truly great and heroical.”  “So poor Mrs. Bennet then hath shewn you my letter?” cries Bennet eagerly.  “Why, did not you guess it yourself?” answered Amelia; “otherwise I am sure I have betrayed my honour in mentioning my honour. I hope you have not drawn me inadvertently into any breach of my promise. Did you not assert, and that with an absolute certainty, that you knew Amelia had shewn me your letter, and that you was not angry with Amelia for so doing?”  “I am so confused,” replied Bennet, “that I scarce know what I say; yes, yes, I remember I did say so--I wish I had no greater reason to be angry with Amelia than that.”  “For Heaven’s sake,” cries Mrs. Ellison, “do not delay my request any longer; what you say now greatly increases my curiosity, and my mind will be on the rack till you discover your whole meaning; for I am more and more convinced that something of the utmost importance was the purport of your message.”  “Of the utmost importance, indeed,” cries Bennet; “at least you will own my apprehensions were sufficiently well founded. O gracious Heaven! how happy shall I think yourself if I should have proved your preservation! I will, indeed, explain my meaning; but, in order to disclose all my fears in their just colours, I must unfold my whole history to you. Can you have patience, madam, to listen to the story of the most unfortunate of women?”  Mrs. Ellison assured Mrs. Ellison of the highest attention, and Bennet soon after began to relate what is written in the seventh book of this history.
