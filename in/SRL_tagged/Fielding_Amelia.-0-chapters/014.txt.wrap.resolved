 _The narrative continued. More of the touchstone._   Booth made a proper acknowledgment of Miss Matthew’s civility, and then renewed Booth story. “We were upon the footing of lovers; and Amelia threw off Amelia reserve more and more, till at length I found all that return of my affection which the tenderest lover can require.  “My situation would now have been a paradise, had not my happiness been interrupted with the same reflections I have already mentioned; had I not, in short, concluded, that I must derive all my joys from the almost certain ruin of that dear creature to whom I should owe whom.  “This thought haunted me night and day, till I at last grew unable to support it: I therefore resolved in the strongest manner, to lay it before Amelia.  “One evening then, after the highest professions of the most disinterested love, in which Heaven knows my sincerity, I took an occasion to speak to Amelia in the following manner:--  “Too true it is, I am afraid, my dearest creature, that the highest human happiness is imperfect. How rich would be my cup, was it not for one poisonous drop which embitters the whole! O, Amelia! what must be the consequence of my ever having the honour to call you mine!--You know my situation in life, and you know your own: I have nothing more than the poor provision of an ensign’s commission to depend on; your sole dependence is on your mother; should any act of disobedience defeat your expectations, how wretched must your lot be with one poisonous drop which embitters the whole! O, Amelia! how ghastly an object to my mind is the apprehension of your distress! Can I bear to reflect a moment on the certainty of your foregoing all the conveniences of life? on the possibility of your suffering all its most dreadful inconveniencies? what must be my misery, then, to see you in such a situation, and to upbraid one poisonous drop which embitters the whole with being the accursed cause of bringing you to being the accursed? Suppose too in such a season I should be summoned from you. Could I submit to see you encounter all the hazards, the fatigues of war, with one poisonous drop which embitters the whole? you could not you, however willing, support the fatigues of war, with me a single campaign. What then; must I leave you to starve alone, deprived of the tenderness of a husband, deprived too of the tenderness of the best of mothers, through my means? a woman most dear to me, for being the parent, the nurse, and the friend of me Amelia.---But oh! my sweet creature, carry your thoughts a little further. Think of the tenderest consequences, the dearest pledges of our love. Can I bear to think of entailing beggary on the posterity of my Amelia? on our---Oh, Heavens!--on our children!--On the other side, is it possible even to mention the word--I will not, must not, cannot, cannot part with you.---What must our do, my Amelia? It is now I sincerely ask your advice.”  “‘What advice can I give you,’ said my Amelia, ‘in such an alternative? Would to Heaven our had never met!’  “These words were accompanied with a sigh, and a look inexpressibly tender, the tears at the same time overflowing all her lovely cheeks. I was endeavouring to reply when I was interrupted by what soon put an end to the scene.  “our amour had already been buzzed all over the town; and Our amour came at last to the ears of Mrs. Harris: I had, indeed, observed of late a great alteration in that lady’s behaviour towards me whenever I visited at the house; nor could I, for a long time before this evening, ever obtain a private interview with my Amelia; and now, it seems, I owed a private interview with Amelia to Mrs. Harris mother’s intention of overhearing all that passed between us.  “At the period then above mentioned, Mrs. Harris burst from the closet where Mrs. Harris had hid Mrs. Harris, and surprised Mrs. Harris daughter, reclining on my bosom in all that tender sorrow I have just described. I will not attempt to paint the rage of her mother, or the daughter’s confusion, or my own. ‘Here are very fine doings, indeed,’ cries Mrs. Harris: ‘you have made a noble use, Amelia, of my indulgence, and the trust I reposed in you.--As for you, Mr. Booth, I will not accuse you; you have used my child as I ought to have expected; I may thank Mrs. Harris for what hath happened;’ with much more of the same kind, before Mrs. Harris would suffer me to speak; but at last I obtained a hearing, and offered to excuse my poor Amelia, who was ready to sink into the earth under the oppression of grief, by taking as much blame as I could on Mrs. Harris. Mrs. Harris answered, ‘No, Mrs. Harris, I must say you are innocent in comparison of Mrs. Harris; nay, I can say I have heard you use dissuasive arguments; and I promise you dissuasive arguments are of weight. I have, I thank Heaven, one dutiful child, and I shall henceforth think Mrs. Harris my only one.’--She then forced the poor, trembling, fainting Amelia out of the room; which when Mrs. Harris had done, Mrs. Harris began very coolly to reason with Mrs. Harris on the folly, as well as iniquity, which I had been guilty of; and repeated to Mrs. Harris almost every word I had before urged to Mrs. Harris daughter. In fine, Mrs. Harris at last obtained of Mrs. Harris a promise that I would soon go to my regiment, and submit to any misery rather than that of being the ruin of Amelia.  “I now, for many days, endured the greatest torments which the human mind is, I believe, capable of feeling; and I can honestly say I tried all the means, and applied every argument which I could raise, to cure me of my love. And to make these the more effectual, I spent every night in walking backwards and forwards in the sight of Mrs. Harris’s house, where I never failed to find some object or other which raised some tender idea of my lovely Amelia, and almost drove me to distraction.”  “And don’t you think, sir,” said Miss Matthews, “you took a most preposterous method to cure yourself?”  “Alas, madam,” answered he, “you cannot see it in a more absurd light than I do; but those know little of real love or grief who do not know how much we deceive we when we pretend to aim at the cure of either. It is with these, as it is with some distempers of the body, nothing is in the least agreeable to we but what serves to heighten the disease.  “At the end of a fortnight, when I was driven almost to the highest degree of despair, and could contrive no method of conveying a letter to my lovely Amelia, how was I surprised when Mrs. Harris’s servant brought me a card, with an invitation from the mother herself to drink tea that evening at the mother herself house!  “You will easily believe, madam, that I did not fail so agreeable an appointment: on my arrival I was introduced into a large company of men and women, Mrs. Harris and my Amelia being part of the company.  “my Amelia seemed in my eyes to look more beautiful than ever, and behaved with all the gaiety imaginable. The old lady treated me with much civility, but The old lady took little notice of me, and addressed most of The old lady discourse to another gentleman present. Indeed, The old lady now and then gave me a look of no discouraging kind, and I observed The old lady colour change more than once when The old lady met mine; circumstances, which, perhaps, ought to have afforded me sufficient comfort, but she now and could not allay the thousand doubts and fears with which I was alarmed, for my anxious thoughts suggested no less to me than that my Amelia had made my Amelia peace with my Amelia mother at the price of abandoning me forever, and of giving The old lady ear to some other lover. All my prudence now vanished at once; and I would that instant have gladly run away with my Amelia, and have married my Amelia without the least consideration of any consequences.  “With such thoughts I had tormented me for near two hours, till most of the company had taken their leave. This I was me incapable of doing, nor do I know when I should have put an end to my visit, had not Dr Harrison taken me away almost by force, telling me in a whisper that Dr Harrison had something to say to me of great consequence.--You know the doctor, madam--”  “Very well, sir,” answered Miss Matthews, “and one of the best men in the world sir is, and an honour to the sacred order to which sir belongs.”  “You will judge,” replied Booth, “by the sequel, whether I have reason to think Booth so.”--He then proceeded as in the next chapter.
