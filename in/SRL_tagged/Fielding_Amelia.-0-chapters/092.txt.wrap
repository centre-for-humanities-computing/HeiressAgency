 _Consequences of the masquerade, not uncommon nor surprizing_.   The lady, getting first out of her chair, ran hastily up into the nursery to the children; for such was Amelia’s constant method at her return home, at whatever hour. Booth then walked into the dining-room, where he had not been long before Amelia came down to him, and, with a most chearful countenance, said, “My dear, I fancy we have neither of us supped; shall I go down and see whether there is any cold meat in the house?”  “For yourself, if you please,” answered Booth; “but I shall eat nothing.”  “How, my dear!” said Amelia; “I hope you have not lost your appetite at the masquerade!” for supper was a meal at which he generally eat very heartily.  “I know not well what I have lost,” said Booth; “I find myself disordered.--My head aches. I know not what is the matter with me.”  “Indeed, my dear, you frighten me,” said Amelia; “you look, indeed, disordered. I wish the masquerade had been far enough before you had gone thither.”  “Would to Heaven it had!” cries Booth; “but that is over now. But pray, Amelia, answer me one question--Who was that gentleman with you when I came up to you?”  “The gentleman! my dear,” said Amelia; “what gentleman?”  “The gentleman--the nobleman--when I came up; sure I speak plain.”  “Upon my word, my dear, I don’t understand you,” answered she; “I did not know one person at the masquerade.”  “How!” said he; “what! spend the whole evening with a masque without knowing him?”  “Why, my dear,” said she, “you know we were not together.”  “I know we were not,” said he, “but what is that to the purpose? Sure you answer me strangely. I know we were not together; and therefore I ask you whom you were with?”  “Nay, but, my dear,” said she, “can I tell people in masques?”  “I say again, madam,” said he, “would you converse two hours or more with a masque whom you did not know?”  “Indeed, child,” says she, “I know nothing of the methods of a masquerade; for I never was at one in my life.”  “I wish to Heaven you had not been at this!” cries Booth. “Nay, you will wish so yourself if you tell me truth.--What have I said? do I--can I suspect you of not speaking truth? Since you are ignorant then I will inform you: the man you have conversed with was no other than Lord----.”  “And is that the reason,” said she, “you wish I had not been there?”  “And is not that reason,” answered he, “sufficient? Is he not the last man upon earth with whom I would have you converse?”  “So you really wish then that I had not been at the masquerade?”  “I do,” cried he, “from my soul.”  “So may I ever be able,” cried she, “to indulge you in every wish as in this.--I was not there.”  “Do not trifle, Amelia,” cried he; “you would not jest with me if you knew the situation of my mind.”  “Indeed I do not jest with you,” said she. “Upon my honour I was not there. Forgive me this first deceit I ever practised, and indeed it shall be the last; for I have paid severely for this by the uneasiness it hath given me.” She then revealed to him the whole secret, which was thus:  I think it hath been already mentioned in some part of this history that Amelia and Mrs. Atkinson were exactly of the same make and stature, and that there was likewise a very near resemblance between their voices. When Mrs. Atkinson, therefore, found that Amelia was so extremely averse to the masquerade, she proposed to go thither in her stead, and to pass upon Booth for his own wife.  This was afterwards very easily executed; for, when they left Booth’s lodgings, Amelia, who went last to her chair, ran back to fetch her masque, as she pretended, which she had purposely left behind. She then whipt off her domino, and threw it over Mrs. Atkinson, who stood ready to receive it, and ran immediately downstairs, and, stepping into Amelia’s chair, proceeded with the rest to the masquerade.  As her stature exactly suited that of Amelia, she had very little difficulty to carry on the imposition; for, besides the natural resemblance of their voices, and the opportunity of speaking in a feigned one, she had scarce an intercourse of six words with Booth during the whole time; for the moment they got into the croud she took the first opportunity of slipping from him. And he, as the reader may remember, being seized by other women, and concluding his wife to be safe with Mrs. James, was very well satisfied, till the colonel set him upon the search, as we have seen before.  Mrs. Atkinson, the moment she came home, ran upstairs to the nursery, where she found Amelia, and told her in haste that she might very easily carry on the deceit with her husband; for that she might tell him what she pleased to invent, as they had not been a minute together during the whole evening.  Booth was no sooner satisfied that his wife had not been from home that evening than he fell into raptures with her, gave her a thousand tender caresses, blamed his own judgment, acknowledged the goodness of hers, and vowed never to oppose her will more in any one instance during his life.  Mrs. Atkinson, who was still in the nursery with her masquerade dress, was then summoned down-stairs, and, when Booth saw her and heard her speak in her mimic tone, he declared he was not surprized at his having been imposed upon, for that, if they were both in the same disguise, he should scarce be able to discover the difference between them.  They then sat down to half an hour’s chearful conversation, after which they retired all in the most perfect good humour.
