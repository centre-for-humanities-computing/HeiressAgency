 _In which Mr. Booth resumes Mr. Booth story._   “If I am not mistaken, madam,” continued Mr. Booth, “I was just going to acquaint you with the doctor’s opinion when we were interrupted by the keeper.  “The doctor, having heard counsel on both sides, that is to say, Mrs. Harris for my staying, and Miss Betty for my going, at last delivered Betty own sentiments. As for Amelia, Amelia sat silent, drowned in Amelia tears; nor was I myself in a much better situation.  “‘As the commissions are not signed,’ said the doctor, ‘I think you may be said to remain in your former regiment; and therefore I think you ought to go on this expedition; your duty to your king and country, whose bread you have eaten, requires whose bread; and this is a duty of too high a nature to admit the least deficiency. Regard to your character, likewise, requires you to go; for the world, which might justly blame your staying at home if the case was even fairly stated, will not deal so honestly by you: you must expect to have every circumstance against you heightened, and most of what makes for your defence omitted; and thus you will be stigmatized as a coward without any palliation. As the malicious disposition of mankind is too well known, and the cruel pleasure which they take in destroying the reputations of others, the use we are to make of this knowledge is to afford no handle to reproach; for, bad as the world is, it seldom falls on any man who hath not given some slight cause for censure, though this, perhaps, is often aggravated ten thousand-fold; and, when we blame the malice of the aggravation we ought not to forget we own imprudence in giving the occasion. Remember, my boy, your honour is at stake; and you know how nice the honour of a soldier is in these cases. This is a treasure which a soldier must be your enemy, indeed, who would attempt to rob you of. Therefore, you ought to consider every one as your enemy who, by desiring you to stay, would rob you of your honour.’  “‘Do you hear that, sister?’ cries Miss Betty.--‘Yes, I do hear Miss Betty.--‘Yes’ answered Amelia, with more spirit than I ever saw Amelia exert before, and would preserve how nice the honour of a soldier at the expense of my life. ‘I will preserve it if it should be at the expense of my life; and since it is Dr Harrison’s opinion that Harrison ought to go, I give my consent. Go, my dear husband,’ cried Amelia, falling upon Amelia knees: ‘may every angel of heaven guard and preserve you!’--I cannot repeat Amelia words without being affected,” said Harrison, wiping Harrison eyes, “the excellence of Amelia no words can paint: Miss Betty.--‘Yes, Miss Betty.--‘Yes hath every perfection in human nature.  “I will not tire you with the repetition of any more that past on that occasion, nor with the quarrel that ensued between Mrs. Harris and the doctor; for Miss Betty.--‘Yes could not submit to my leaving Miss Betty.--‘Yes daughter in Miss Betty.--‘Yes present condition. Miss Betty.--‘Yes fell severely on the army, and cursed the day in which her daughter was married to a soldier, not sparing the doctor for having had some share in the match. I will omit, likewise, the tender scene which past between Amelia and myself previous to my departure.” “Indeed, I beg you would not,” cries Miss Miss Betty.--‘Yes; “nothing delights me more than scenes of tenderness. I should be glad to know, if possible, every syllable which was uttered on both sides.”  “I will indulge you then,” cries Booth, “as far as is in my power. Indeed, I believe I am able to recollect much the greatest part; for the impression is never to be effaced from my memory.”  Indeed, I believe I am able to recollect much the greatest part; for the impression is never to be effaced from my memory.”   then proceeded as Miss Matthews desired; but, lest all our readers should not be of Miss Matthews opinion, we will, according to we usual custom, endeavour to accommodate we to every taste, and shall, therefore, place this scene in a chapter by itself, which we desire all our readers who do not love, or who, perhaps, do not know the pleasure of tenderness, to pass over; since they may do this without any prejudice to the thread of the narrative.
