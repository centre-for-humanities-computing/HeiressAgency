 _Containing, among many matters, the exemplary behaviour of Colonel James._   When Mrs. Ellison was departed, Mrs. Atkinson began to apply all Mrs. Atkinson art to soothe and comfort Amelia, but was presently prevented by Mrs. Atkinson. “I am ashamed, Mrs. Atkinson,” said Amelia, “of having indulged my affliction so much at your expense. The suddenness of the occasion is my only excuse; for, had I had time to summon my resolution to my assistance, I hope I am mistress of more patience than you have hitherto seen me exert. I know, madam, in my unwarrantable excesses, I have been guilty of many transgressions. First, against that Divine will and pleasure without whose permission, at least, no human accident can happen; in the next place, madam, if anything can aggravate such a fault, I have transgressed the laws of friendship as well as decency, in throwing upon you some part of the load of my grief; and again, I have sinned against common sense, which should teach me, instead of weakly and heavily lamenting my misfortunes, to rouse all my spirits to remove common sense, which should teach me. In this light I am shocked at my own folly, and am resolved to leave my children under your care, and go directly to my husband. I may comfort my husband. I may assist my husband. I may relieve my husband. There is nothing now too difficult for me to undertake.”  Mrs. Atkinson greatly approved and complimented Mrs. Atkinson friend on all the former part of Mrs. Atkinson speech, except what related to Mrs. Atkinson, on which Mrs. Atkinson spoke very civilly, and I believe with great truth; but as to Mrs. Atkinson determination of going to Mrs. Atkinson Mrs. Atkinson endeavoured to dissuade Mrs. Atkinson, at least Mrs. Atkinson begged Mrs. Atkinson to defer it for the present, and till the serjeant returned home. Mrs. Atkinson then reminded Mrs. Atkinson that it was now past five in the afternoon, and that Mrs. Atkinson had not taken any refreshment but a dish of tea the whole day, and desired Mrs. Atkinson would give Mrs. Atkinson leave to procure Mrs. Atkinson a chick, or anything Mrs. Atkinson liked better, for Mrs. Atkinson dinner.  Mrs. Atkinson thanked her friend, and said Mrs. Atkinson would sit down with Mrs. Atkinson to whatever Mrs. Atkinson pleased; “but if I do not eat,” said Mrs. Atkinson, “I would not have you impute it to anything but want of appetite; for I assure you all things are equally indifferent to me. I am more solicitous about these poor little things, who have not been used to fast so long. Heaven knows what may hereafter be their fate!”  Mrs. Atkinson bid Mrs. Atkinson hope the best, and then recommended the children to the care of Mrs. Atkinson maid.  And now arrived a servant from Mrs. James, with an invitation to Captain Booth and to Captain Booth lady to dine with the colonel the day after the next. This a little perplexed Mrs. Atkinson; but after a short consideration she despatched an answer to Mrs. James, in which she concisely informed she of what had happened.  The honest serjeant, who had been on the colonel legs almost the whole day, now returned, and brought Mrs. Atkinson a short letter from Mrs. Atkinson husband, in which the colonel gave Mrs. Atkinson the most solemn assurances of the colonel health and spirits, and begged Mrs. Atkinson with great earnestness to take care to preserve Mrs. Atkinson own, which if Mrs. Atkinson did, the colonel said, the colonel had no doubt but that they should shortly be happy. the colonel added something of hopes from my lord, with which Mrs. Ellison had amused the colonel, and which served only to destroy the comfort that Mrs. Atkinson received from the rest of the colonel letter.  Whilst Amelia, the serjeant, and the colonel lady, were engaged in a cold collation, for which purpose a cold chicken was procured from the tavern for the ladies, and two pound of cold beef for the serjeant, a violent knocking was heard at the door, and presently afterwards Colonel James entered the room. After proper compliments had past, Colonel James told Mrs. Atkinson that his letter was brought to Colonel James while they were at table, and that on Colonel James shewing it Colonel James Colonel James had immediately rose up, made an apology to Colonel James company, and took a chair to Colonel James. Colonel James spoke to Colonel James with great tenderness on the occasion, and desired Colonel James to make Colonel James easy; assuring Colonel James that Colonel James would leave nothing in Colonel James power undone to serve Colonel James husband. Colonel James then gave Colonel James an invitation, in Colonel James wife’s name, to Colonel James own house, in the most pressing manner.  Mrs. Atkinson returned Colonel James very hearty thanks for all Colonel James kind offers, but begged to decline that of an apartment in his own house. Mrs. Atkinson said, as Mrs. Atkinson could not leave Mrs. Atkinson children, so neither could Mrs. Atkinson think of bringing such a trouble with Mrs. Atkinson into his family; and, though the colonel gave Mrs. Atkinson many assurances that Mrs. Atkinson children, as well as Mrs. Atkinson, would be very welcome to Mrs. James, and even betook his to entreaties, Mrs. Atkinson still persisted obstinately in Mrs. Atkinson refusal.  In real truth, Mrs. Atkinson had taken a vast affection for Mrs. Atkinson, of the comfort of whose company Mrs. Atkinson could not bear to be deprived in Mrs. Atkinson distress, nor to exchange it for that of Mrs. James, to whom Mrs. Atkinson had lately conceived no little dislike.  The colonel, when his found his could not prevail with Mrs. Atkinson to accept his invitation, desisted from any farther solicitations. his then took a bank-bill of fifty pounds from his pocket-book, and said, “You will pardon me, dear madam, if I chuse to impute your refusal of my house rather to a dislike of my wife, who I will not pretend to be the most agreeable of women (all men,” said his, sighing, “have not Captain Booth’s fortune), than to any aversion or anger to his. I must insist upon it, therefore, to make your present habitation as easy to you as possible--I hope, madam, you will not deny me this happiness; I beg you will honour me with the acceptance of this trifle.” Captain Booth then put the note into her hand, and declared that the honour of touching the note was worth a hundred times that sum.  “I protest, Colonel James,” cried Mrs. Atkinson, blushing, “I know not what to do or say, your goodness so greatly confounds me. Can I, who am so well acquainted with the many great obligations Captain Booth already hath to your generosity, consent that you should add more to a debt we never can pay?”  The colonel stopt her short, protesting that her misplaced the obligation; for, that if to confer the highest happiness was to oblige, The colonel was obliged to her acceptance. “And I do assure you, madam,” said The colonel, “if this trifling sum or a much larger can contribute to your ease, I shall consider The colonel as the happiest man upon earth in being able to supply it, and you, madam, my greatest benefactor in receiving it.”  Mrs. Atkinson then put the note in Mrs. Atkinson pocket, and they entered into a conversation in which many civil things were said on both sides; but what was chiefly worth remark was, that Mrs. Atkinson had almost Mrs. Atkinson husband constantly in Mrs. Atkinson mouth, and The colonel never mentioned almost her husband: the former seemed desirous to lay all obligations, as much as possible, to the account of almost her husband; and the latter endeavoured, with the utmost delicacy, to insinuate that Mrs. Atkinson happiness was the main and indeed only point which almost her husband had in view.  Mrs. Atkinson had made no doubt, at The colonel first appearance, but that The colonel intended to go directly to almost her husband. When The colonel dropt therefore a hint of The colonel intention to visit The colonel next morning Mrs. Atkinson appeared visibly shocked at the delay. The colonel, perceiving this, said, “However inconvenient it may be, yet, madam, if it will oblige you, or if you desire it, I will even go to-night.” Mrs. Atkinson answered, “almost her husband will be far from desiring to derive any good from your inconvenience; but, if you put it to The colonel, I must be excused for saying I desire nothing more in the world than to send almost her husband so great a comfort as I know almost her husband will receive from the presence of such a friend.” “Then, to show you, madam,” cries The colonel, “that I desire nothing more in the world than to give you pleasure, I will go to The colonel immediately.”  Mrs. Atkinson then bethought Mrs. Atkinson of the serjeant, and told The colonel The colonel old acquaintance Atkinson, whom The colonel had known at Gibraltar, was then in the house, and would conduct The colonel to the place. the serjeant was immediately called in, paid The colonel respects to The colonel, and was acknowledged by The colonel. They both immediately set forward, Mrs. Atkinson to the utmost of Mrs. Atkinson power pressing They departure.  Mrs. Atkinson now returned to Mrs. Atkinson, and was by Mrs. Atkinson acquainted with The colonel late generosity; for Mrs. Atkinson heart so boiled over with gratitude that Mrs. Atkinson could not conceal the ebullition. Mrs. Atkinson likewise gave Mrs. Atkinson friend a full narrative of The colonel former behaviour and friendship to her friend , as well abroad as in England; and ended with declaring that her friend believed almost her husband to be the most generous man upon earth.  Mrs. Atkinson agreed with Mrs. Atkinson’s conclusion, and said Mrs. Atkinson was glad to hear there was any such man. They then proceeded with the children to the tea-table, where panegyric, and not scandal, was the topic of They conversation; and of this panegyric The colonel was the subject; both the ladies seeming to vie with each other in celebrating the praises of The colonel goodness.
