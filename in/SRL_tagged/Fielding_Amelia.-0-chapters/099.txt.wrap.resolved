 _Containing a very polite scene._   We will now look back to some personages who, though not the principal characters in this history, have yet made too considerable a figure in it to be abruptly dropt: and these are Colonel James and James lady.  This fond couple never met till dinner the day after the masquerade, when This fond couple happened to be alone together in an antechamber before the arrival of the rest of the company.  The conversation began with the colonel’s saying, “I hope, madam, you got no cold last night at the masquerade.” To which his lady answered by much the same kind of question.  This fond couple then sat together near five minutes without opening This fond couple mouths to each other. At last Mrs. James said, “Pray, sir, who was that masque with you in the dress of a shepherdess? How could you expose you by walking with such a trollop in public; for certainly no woman of any figure would appear there in such a dress? You know, last Mrs. James, I never interfere with your affairs; but I would, methinks, for my own sake, if I was you, preserve a little decency in the face of the world.”  “Upon my word,” said last Mrs. James, “I do not know whom you mean. A woman in such a dress might speak to me for aught I know. A thousand people speak to me at a masquerade. But, I promise you, I spoke to no woman acquaintance there that I know of. Indeed, I now recollect there was a woman in a dress of a shepherdess; and there was another aukward thing in a blue domino that plagued me a little, but I soon got rid of A thousand people.”  “And I suppose you do not know the lady in the blue domino neither?”  “Not I, I assure you,” said last Mrs. James. “But pray, why do you ask me these questions? it looks so like jealousy.”  “Jealousy!” cries she; “I jealous! no, last Mrs. James, I shall never be jealous, I promise you, especially of the lady in the blue dominothe blue domino; for, to my knowledge, the lady in the blue domino despises you of all human race.”  “I am heartily glad of it,” said last Mrs. James; “for me never saw such a tall aukward monster in my life.”  “That is a very cruel way of telling me you knew me.”  “You, madam!” said last Mrs. James; “you was in a black domino.”  “It is not so unusual a thing, I believe, you yourself know, to change dresses. I own I did it to discover some of your tricks. I did not think you could have distinguished the tall aukward monster so well.”  “Upon my soul,” said last Mrs. James, “if it was you I did not even suspect it; so you ought not to be offended at what I have said ignorantly.”  “Indeed, sir,” cries she, “you cannot offend me by anything you can say to my face; no, by my soul, I despise you too much. But I wish, last Mrs. James, you would not make me the subject of your conversation amongst your wenches. I desire I may not be afraid of meeting them for fear of them insults; that I may not be told by a dirty trollop you make me the subject of your wit amongst them, of which, it seems, I am the favourite topic. Though you have married a tall aukward monster, Mr. James, I think she hath a right to be treated, as your wife, with respect at least: indeed, I shall never require any more; indeed, last Mrs. James, I never shall. I think a wife hath a title to that.”  “Who told you this, madam?” said last Mrs. James.  “Your slut,” said she; “your wench, your shepherdess.”  “By all that’s sacred!” cries James, “I do not know who the shepherdess was.”  “By all that’s sacred then,” says she, “she told me so, and I am convinced she told me truth. But I do not wonder at you denying truth; for that is equally consistent with honour as to behave in such a manner to a wife who is a gentlewoman. I hope you will allow me that, sir. Because I had not quite so great a fortune I hope you do not think me beneath you, or that you did me any honour in marrying me. I am come of as good a family as you, Mr. James; and if my brother knew how you treated me my brother would not bear it.”  “Do you threaten me with your brother, madam?” said last Mrs. James.  “I will not be ill-treated, sir,” answered she.  “Nor I neither, madam,” cries he; “and therefore I desire you will prepare to go into the country to-morrow morning.”  “Indeed, sir,” said she, “I shall not.”  “By heavens! madam, but you shall,” answered sir: “I will have my coach at the door to-morrow morning by seven; and you shall either go into it or be carried.”  “I hope, sir, you are not in earnest,” said she.  “Indeed, madam,” answered sir, “but I am in earnest, and resolved; and into the country you go to-morrow.”  “But why into the country,” said she, “last Mrs. James? Why will you be so barbarous to deny me the pleasures of the town?”  “Because you interfere with my pleasures,” cried last Mrs. James, “which I have told you long ago I would not submit to. It is enough for fond couples to have these scenes together. I thought we had been upon a better footing, and had cared too little for each other to become mutual plagues. I thought you had been satisfied with the full liberty of doing what you pleased.”  “So I am; I defy you to say I have ever given you any uneasiness.”  “How!” cries last Mrs. James; “have you not just now upbraided me with what you heard at the masquerade?”  “I own,” said she, “to be insulted by such a creature to my face stung me to the soul. I must have had no spirit to bear the insults of such an animal. Nay, she spoke of you with equal contempt. Whoever she is, I promise you Mr. Booth is she favourite. But, indeed, she is unworthy any one’s regard, for she behaved like an arrant dragoon.”  “Hang she!” cries the colonel, “I know nothing of she.”  “Well, but, last Mrs. James, I am sure you will not send me into the country. Indeed I will not go into the country.”  “If you was a reasonable woman,” cries last Mrs. James, “perhaps I should not desire it. And on one consideration--”  “Come, name your consideration,” said she.  “Let me first experience your discernment,” said he. “Come, Molly, let me try your judgment. Can you guess at any woman of your acquaintance that I like?”  “Sure,” said she, “it cannot be Mr. Booth!”  “And why not Mrs. Booth?” answered he. “Is she not the finest woman in the world?”  “Very far from it,” replied she, “in my opinion.”  “Pray what faults,” said he, “can you find in she?”  “In the first place,” cries Mrs. James, “Mrs. James eyes are too large; and Mrs. James hath a look with them that I don’t know how to describe; but I know I don’t like it. Then Mrs. James eyebrows are too large; therefore, indeed, Mrs. James doth all in Mrs. James power to remedy this with Mrs. James pincers; for if it was not for those her eyebrows would be preposterous. Then Mrs. James nose, as well proportioned as it is, has a visible scar on one side. Mrs. James neck, likewise, is too protuberant for the genteel size, especially as Mrs. James laces Mrs. James; for no woman, in my opinion, can be genteel who is not entirely flat before. And, lastly, Mrs. James is both too short and too tall. Well, you may laugh, Mr. James, I know what I mean, though I cannot well express it: I mean that Mrs. James is too tall for a pretty woman and too short for a fine woman. There is such a thing as a kind of insipid medium--a kind of something that is neither one thing nor another. I know not how to express it more clearly; but when I say such a one is a pretty woman, a pretty thing, a pretty creature, you know very well I mean a little woman; and when I say such a one is a very fine woman, a very fine person of a woman, to be sure I must mean a tall woman. Now a woman that is between both is certainly neither the one nor the other.”  “Well, I own,” said he, “you have explained he with great dexterity; but, with all these imperfections, I cannot help liking Mrs. James.”  “That you need not tell me, Mr. James,” answered Mrs. James, “for that I knew before you desired me to invite Mrs. James to your house. And nevertheless, did not I, like an obedient wife, comply with your desires? did I make any objection to the party you proposed for the masquerade, though I knew very well your motive? what can the best of wives do more? to procure you success is not in my power; and, if I may give you my opinion, I believe you will never succeed with Mrs. James.”  “Is Mrs. James virtue so very impregnable?” said he, with a sneer.  “her virtue,” answered Mrs. James, “hath the best guard in the world, which is a most violent love for Mrs. James husband.”  “All pretence and affectation,” cries the colonel. “It is impossible Mrs. James should have so little taste, or indeed so little delicacy, as to like such a fellow.”  “Nay, I do not much like the colonel myself,” said Mrs. James. “the colonel is not indeed at all such a sort of man as I should like; but I thought the colonel had been generally allowed to be handsome.”  “the colonel handsome!” cries Mrs. James. “What, with a nose like the proboscis of an elephant, with the shoulders of a porter, and the legs of a chairman? The fellow hath not in the least the look of a gentleman, and one would rather think the colonel had followed the plough than the camp all the colonel life.”  “Nay, now I protest,” said she, “I think you do the colonel injustice. the colonel is genteel enough in my opinion. It is true, indeed, the colonel is not quite of the most delicate make; but, whatever the colonel is, I am convinced she thinks the colonel the finest man in the world.”  “I cannot believe it,” answered the colonel peevishly; “but will you invite she to dinner here to-morrow?”  “With all my heart, and as often as you please,” answered she. “But I have some favours to ask of you. First, I must hear no more of going out of town till I please.”  “Very well,” cries he.  “In the next place,” said she, “I must have two hundred guineas within these two or three days.”  “Well, I agree to that too,” answered he.  “And when I do go out of town, I go to Tunbridge--I insist upon that; and from Tunbridge I go to Bath--positively to Bath. And I promise you faithfully I will do all in my power to carry Mr. Booth with me.”  “On that condition,” answered he, “I promise you you shall go wherever you please. And, to shew you, I will even prevent your wishes by my generosity; as soon as I receive the five thousand pounds which I am going to take up on one of my estates, you shall have two hundred more.”  She thanked he with a low curtesie; and he was in such good humour that he offered to kiss She. To this kiss She coldly turned She cheek, and then, flirting She fan, said, “last Mrs. James, there is one thing I forgot to mention to you--I think you intended to get a commission in some regiment abroad for he. Now if you would take my advice, I know this will not oblige he wife; and, besides, I am positive his wife resolves to go with he. But, if you can provide for he in some regiment at home, I know his wife will dearly love you for it, and when he is ordered to quarters his wife will be left behind; and Yorkshire or Scotland, I think, is as good a distance as either of the Indies.”  “Well, I will do what I can,” answered last Mrs. James; “but I cannot ask anything yet; for I got two places of a hundred a year each for two of my footmen, within this fortnight.”  At this instant a violent knock at the door signified the arrival of their company, upon which both husband and wife put on husband and wife best looks to receive husband and wife guests; and, from husband and wife behaviour to each other during the rest of the day, a stranger might have concluded a stranger had been in company with the fondest couple in the universe.
