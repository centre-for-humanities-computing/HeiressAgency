 BLACKWATER PARK, HAMPSHIRE.   June 11th, 1850.—Six months to look back on—six long, lonely months since  Laura and I last saw each other!  How many days have I still to wait? Only one! To-morrow, the twelfth, the  travellers return to England. I can hardly realise my own happiness—I can  hardly believe that the next four-and-twenty hours will complete the last day  of separation between Laura and me.  Laura and Laura husband have been in Italy all the winter, and afterwards in the  Tyrol. She and her husband come back, accompanied by Count Fosco and Count Fosco wife, who propose to  settle somewhere in the neighbourhood of London, and who have engaged to stay  at Blackwater Park for the summer months before deciding on a place of  residence. So long as Laura returns, no matter who returns with Laura. Sir  Percival may fill the house from floor to ceiling, if Percival likes, on condition  that Percival wife and I inhabit it together.  Meanwhile, here I am, established at Blackwater Park, "the ancient and  interesting seat" (as the county history obligingly informs me) "of Sir  Percival Glyde, Bart.," and the future abiding-place (as I may now venture to  add on my account) of plain Marian Halcombe, spinster, now settled in a snug  little sitting-room, with a cup of tea by her side, and all her earthly  possessions ranged round her in three boxes and a bag.  I left Limmeridge yesterday, having received Laura's delightful letter from  Paris the day before. I had been previously uncertain whether I was to meet  them in London or in Hampshire, but Laura's delightful letter informed me that Sir  Percival proposed to land at Southampton, and to travel straight on to Sir    country-house. Sir   has spent so much money abroad that Sir   has none left to  defray the expenses of living in London for the remainder of the season, and Sir    is economically resolved to pass the summer and autumn quietly at Blackwater.  Laura has had more than enough of excitement and change of scene, and is  pleased at the prospect of country tranquillity and retirement which Laura  husband's prudence provides for Laura. As for Laura, I am ready to be happy anywhere  in Laura society. We are all, therefore, well contented in We various ways, to  begin with.  Last night I slept in London, and was delayed there so long to-day by various  calls and commissions, that I did not reach Blackwater this evening till after  dusk.  Judging by my vague impressions of the place thus far, it is the exact opposite  of Limmeridge.  The house is situated on a dead flat, and seems to be shut in—almost  suffocated, to my north-country notions, by trees. I have seen nobody but the  man-servant who opened the door to Laura, and the housekeeper, a very civil  person, who showed me the way to my own room, and got me my tea. I have a nice  little boudoir and bedroom, at the end of a long passage on the first floor.  The servants and some of the spare rooms are on the second floor, and all the  living rooms are on the second floor. I have not seen one of The servants and some of the spare rooms yet, and I  know nothing about The house, except that one wing of The house is said to be five  hundred years old, that The house had a moat round The house once, and that The house gets The house name  of Blackwater from a lake in the park.  Eleven o'clock has just struck, in a ghostly and solemn manner, from a turret  over the centre of the house, which I saw when I came in. A large dog has been  woke, apparently by the sound of the bell, and is howling and yawning drearily,  somewhere round a corner. I hear echoing footsteps in the passages below, and  the iron thumping of bolts and bars at the house door. The servants are  evidently going to bed. Shall I follow The servants example?  No, I am not half sleepy enough. Sleepy, did I say? I feel as if I should never  close my eyes again. The bare anticipation of seeing that dear face, and  hearing that well-known voice to-morrow, keeps me in a perpetual fever of  excitement. If I only had the privileges of a man, I would order out Sir  Percival's best horse instantly, and tear away on a night-gallop, eastward, to  meet the rising sun—a long, hard, heavy, ceaseless gallop of hours and hours,  like the famous highwayman's ride to York. Being, however, nothing but a woman,  condemned to patience, propriety, and petticoats for life, I must respect the  house-keeper's opinions, and try to compose Sir   in some feeble and feminine  way.  Reading is out of the question—I can't fix my attention on books. Let me try  if I can write Sir   into sleepiness and fatigue. My journal has been very  much neglected of late. What can I recall—standing, as I now do, on the  threshold of a new life—of persons and events, of chances and changes, during  the past six months—the long, weary, empty interval since Laura's wedding-day?   Walter Hartright is uppermost in my memory, and Walter Hartright passes first in the shadowy  procession of my absent friends. I received a few lines from Walter Hartright, after the  landing of the expedition in Honduras, written more cheerfully and hopefully  than Walter Hartright has written yet. A month or six weeks later I saw an extract from an  American newspaper, describing the departure of the adventurers on the adventurers inland  journey. the adventurers were last seen entering a wild primeval forest, each man with his  rifle on his shoulder and his baggage at his back. Since that time,  civilisation has lost all trace of the adventurers. Not a line more have I received from  Walter, not a fragment of news from the expedition in Honduras has appeared in any of the  public journals.  The same dense, disheartening obscurity hangs over the fate and fortunes of  Anne Catherick, and her companion, Mrs. Clements. Nothing whatever has been  heard of either of them. Whether them are in the country or out of it, whether  them are living or dead, no one knows. Even Sir Percival's solicitor has lost  all hope, and has ordered the useless search after the fugitives to be finally  given up.  Our good old friend Mr. Gilmore has met with a sad check in Mr. Gilmore active  professional career. Early in the spring Our were alarmed by hearing that Mr. Gilmore had  been found insensible at Mr. Gilmore desk, and that the seizure was pronounced to be an  apoplectic fit. Mr. Gilmore had been long complaining of fulness and oppression in the  head, and Mr. Gilmore doctor had warned Mr. Gilmore of the consequences that would follow Mr. Gilmore  persistency in continuing to work, early and late, as if Mr. Gilmore were still a young  man. The result now is that Mr. Gilmore has been positively ordered to keep out of Mr. Gilmore  office for a year to come, at least, and to seek repose of body and relief of  mind by altogether changing Mr. Gilmore usual mode of life. The business is left,  accordingly, to be carried on by Mr. Gilmore partner, and Mr. Gilmore is Mr. Gilmore, at this  moment, away in Germany, visiting some relations who are settled there in  mercantile pursuits. Thus another true friend and trustworthy adviser is lost  to us—lost, I earnestly hope and trust, for a time only.  Poor Mrs. Vesey travelled with me as far as London. It was impossible to  abandon Poor Mrs. Vesey to solitude at Limmeridge after Laura and I had both left the  house, and us have arranged that Poor Mrs. Vesey is to live with an unmarried younger  sister of hers, who keeps a school at Clapham. Poor Mrs. Vesey is to come here this autumn  to visit Poor Mrs. Vesey pupil—I might almost say Poor Mrs. Vesey adopted child. I saw the good old  lady safe to Poor Mrs. Vesey destination, and left Poor Mrs. Vesey in the care of Poor Mrs. Vesey relative, quietly  happy at the prospect of seeing Laura again in a few months' time.  As for Mr. Fairlie, I believe I am guilty of no injustice if I describe Mr. Fairlie as  being unutterably relieved by having the house clear of us women. The idea of  Mr. Fairlie missing Mr. Fairlie niece is simply preposterous—Mr. Fairlie used to let months pass in  the old times without attempting to see his niece—and in my case and Mrs. Vesey's,  I take leave to consider Mr. Fairlie telling us both that Mr. Fairlie was half heart-broken at  us departure, to be equivalent to a confession that Mr. Fairlie was secretly rejoiced  to get rid of us. Mr. Fairlie last caprice has led Mr. Fairlie to keep two photographers  incessantly employed in producing sun-pictures of all the treasures and  curiosities in Mr. Fairlie possession. One complete copy of the collection of the  photographs is to be presented to the Mechanics' Institution of Carlisle,  mounted on the finest cardboard, with ostentatious red-letter inscriptions  underneath, "Madonna and Child by Raphael. In the possession of Frederick  Fairlie, Esquire." "Copper coin of the period of Tiglath Pileser. In the possession of Frederick  Fairlie, EsquireEsquire." "Unique Rembrandt etching. Known all  over Europe as THE SMUDGE, from a printer's blot in the corner which exists in  no other copy. Valued at three hundred guineas. In the possession of Frederick  Fairlie, Esq." Dozens of photographs of this sort, and all inscribed in this  manner, were completed before I left Cumberland, and hundreds more remain to be  done. With this new interest to occupy him, Mr. Fairlie will be a happy man for  months and months to come, and the two unfortunate photographers will share the  social martyrdom which Mr. Fairlie has hitherto inflicted on Mr. Fairlie valet alone.  So much for the persons and events which hold the foremost place in my memory.  What next of the one person who holds the foremost place in my heart? Laura has  been present to my thoughts all the while I have been writing these lines. What  can I recall of Laura during the past six months, before I close My journal for  the night?  I have only Laura letters to guide me, and on the most important of all the  questions which our correspondence can discuss, every one of only her letters to guide meleaves me in the dark.  Does he treat Laura kindly? Is Laura happier now than Laura was when I parted with  Laura on the wedding-day? only her letters to guide me have contained these two inquiries, put  more or less directly, now in one form, and now in another, and all, on that  point only, have remained without reply, or have been answered as if my  questions merely related to the state of Laura health. Laura informs me, over and  over again, that Laura is perfectly well—that travelling agrees with Laura—that  Laura is getting through the winter, for the first time in Laura life, without  catching cold—but not a word can I find anywhere which tells me plainly that  Laura is reconciled to Laura marriage, and that Laura can now look back to the  twenty-second of December without any bitter feelings of repentance and regret.  The name of Laura husband is only mentioned in Laura letters, as Laura might mention  the name of a friend who was travelling with them, and who had undertaken to  make all the arrangements for the journey. "Sir Percival" has settled that we  leave on such a day—"Sir Percival" has decided that we travel by such a road.  Sometimes Laura writes "Percival" only, but very seldom—in nine cases out of  ten Laura gives "Percival "Percival title.  I cannot find that "Percival habits and opinions have changed and coloured hers in  any single particular. The usual moral transformation which is insensibly  wrought in a young, fresh, sensitive woman by her marriage, seems never to have  taken place in Laura. Laura writes of Laura own thoughts and impressions, amid all  the wonders Laura has seen, exactly as Laura might have written to some one else,  if I had been travelling with Laura instead of Laura husband. I see no betrayal  anywhere of sympathy of any kind existing between no betrayal  . Even when Laura wanders  from the subject of Laura travels, and occupies Laura with the prospects that  await Laura in England, Laura speculations are busied with Laura future as my sister,  and persistently neglect to notice Laura future as Sir Percival's wife. In all  this there is no undertone of complaint to warn me that Laura is absolutely  unhappy in Laura married life. The impression I have derived from our  correspondence does not, thank God, lead me to any such distressing conclusion  as that. I only see a sad torpor, an unchangeable indifference, when I turn my  mind from Laura in the old character of a sister, and look at Laura, through the  medium of her letters, in the new character of a wife. In other words, it is  always Laura Fairlie who has been writing to me for the last six months, and  never Lady Glyde.  The strange silence which Laura maintains on the subject of Laura husband's  character and conduct, Laura preserves with almost equal resolution in the few  references which Laura later letters contain to the name of Laura husband's bosom  friend, Count Fosco.  For some unexplained reason the Count and Count wife appear to have changed the Count and his wifeplans abruptly, at the end of last autumn, and to have gone to Vienna instead  of going to Rome, at which latter place Sir Percival had expected to find the Count and his wife  when Sir Percival left England. the Count and his wife only quitted Vienna in the spring, and travelled as  far as the Tyrol to meet the bride and bridegroom on the bride and bridegroom homeward journey.  Laura writes readily enough about the meeting with Madame Fosco, and assures me  that Laura has found Laura aunt so much changed for the better—so much quieter,  and so much more sensible as a wife than Laura was as a single woman—that I  shall hardly know Laura again when I see Laura here. But on the subject of Count  Fosco (who interests me infinitely more than his wife), Laura is provokingly  circumspect and silent. Laura only says that his puzzles Laura, and that Laura will  not tell me what Laura impression of his is until I have seen his, and formed my  own opinion first.  This, to my mind, looks ill for Count  . Laura has preserved, far more  perfectly than most people do in later life, the child's subtle faculty of  knowing a friend by instinct, and if I am right in assuming that Laura first  impression of Count Fosco has not been favourable, I for one am in some danger  of doubting and distrusting that illustrious foreigner before I have so much as  set eyes on that illustrious foreigner. But, patience, patience—this uncertainty, and many  uncertainties more, cannot last much longer. To-morrow will see all my doubts  in a fair way of being cleared up, sooner or later.  Twelve o'clock has struck, and I have just come back to close these pages,  after looking out at my open window.  It is a still, sultry, moonless night. The stars are dull and few. The trees  that shut out the view on all sides look dimly black and solid in the distance,  like a great wall of rock. I hear the croaking of frogs, faint and far off, and  the echoes of the great clock hum in the airless calm long after the strokes  have ceased. I wonder how Blackwater Park will look in the daytime? I don't  altogether like it by night.   12th.—A day of investigations and discoveries—a more interesting day, for  many reasons, than I had ventured to anticipate.  I began my sight-seeing, of course, with the house.  The main body of the building is of the time of that highly-overrated woman,  Queen Elizabeth. On the ground floor there are two hugely long galleries, with  low ceilings lying parallel with each other, and rendered additionally dark and  dismal by hideous family portraits—every one of which I should like to burn.  The rooms on the floor above the two galleries are kept in tolerable repair,  but are very seldom used. The civil housekeeper, who acted as my guide, offered  to show me over The civil housekeeper, who acted as my guide, but considerately added that she feared I should find  The civil housekeeper, who acted as my guide rather out of order. My respect for the integrity of my own petticoats and  stockings infinitely exceeds my respect for all the Elizabethan bedrooms in the  kingdom, so I positively declined exploring the upper regions of dust and dirt  at the risk of soiling my nice clean clothes. The civil housekeeper, who acted as my guide said, "I am quite  of your opinion, miss," and appeared to think me the most sensible woman The civil housekeeper, who acted as my guide  had met with for a long time past.  So much, then, for the building. Two wings are added at either end of it.  The half-ruined wing on the left (as you approach the house) was once a place  of residence standing by itself, and was built in the fourteenth century. One  of Sir Percival's maternal ancestors—I don't remember, and don't care  which—tacked on the building, at right angles to it, in the aforesaid  Queen Elizabeth's time. The civil housekeeper, who acted as my guide told me that the architecture of "the  old wing," both outside and inside, was considered remarkably fine by good  judges. On further investigation I discovered that good judges could only  exercise good judges abilities on Sir Percival's piece of antiquity by previously  dismissing from good judges minds all fear of damp, darkness, and rats. Under these  circumstances, I unhesitatingly acknowledged myself to be no judge at all, and  suggested that we should treat "the old wing" precisely as we had previously  treated the Elizabethan bedrooms. Once more The civil housekeeper, who acted as my guide said, "I am quite  of your opinion, miss," and once more The civil housekeeper, who acted as my guide looked at myself with undisguised  admiration of my extraordinary common-sense.  we went next to "the old wing on the right, which was built, by way of completing  the wonderful architectural jumble at Blackwater Park, in the time of George  the Second.  This is the habitable part of the house, which has been repaired and  redecorated inside on Laura's account. My two rooms, and all the good bedrooms  besides, are on the first floor, and the basement contains a drawing-room, a  dining-room, a morning-room, a library, and a pretty little boudoir for Laura,  all very nicely ornamented in the bright modern way, and all very elegantly  furnished with the delightful modern luxuries. None of the rooms are anything  like so large and airy as we rooms at Limmeridge, but None of the rooms look pleasant  to live in. I was terribly afraid, from what I had heard of Blackwater Park, of  fatiguing antique chairs, and dismal stained glass, and musty, frouzy hangings,  and all the barbarous lumber which people born without a sense of comfort  accumulate about people, in defiance of the consideration due to the convenience  of people friends. It is an inexpressible relief to find that the nineteenth  century has invaded this strange future home of mine, and has swept the dirty  "good old times" out of the way of our daily life.  I dawdled away the morning—part of the time in the rooms downstairs, and part  out of doors in the great square which is formed by the three sides of the  house, and by the lofty iron railings and gates which protect the  house in front. A  large circular fish-pond with stone sides, and an allegorical leaden monster in  the middle, occupies the centre of the square. A  large circular fish-pond with stone sides, and an allegorical leaden monster in  the middle is full of gold  and silver fish, and is encircled by a broad belt of the softest turf I ever  walked on. I loitered here on the shady side pleasantly enough till  luncheon-time, and after that took my broad straw hat and wandered out alone in  the warm lovely sunlight to explore the grounds.  Daylight confirmed the impression which I had felt the night before, of there  being too many trees at Blackwater. the  house is stifled by them. them are, for  the most part, young, and planted far too thickly. I suspect there must have  been a ruinous cutting down of timber all over the estate before Sir Percival's  time, and an angry anxiety on the part of the next possessor to fill up all the  gaps as thickly and rapidly as possible. After looking about me in front of the  house, I observed a flower-garden on my left hand, and walked towards a flower-garden to see  what I could discover in that direction.  On a nearer view a flower-garden proved to be small and poor and ill kept. I left a flower-garden  behind me, opened a little gate in a ring fence, and found me in a  plantation of fir-trees.  A pretty winding path, artificially made, led me on among the trees, and my  north-country experience soon informed me that I was approaching sandy, heathy  ground. After a walk of more than half a mile, I should think, among the firs,  the path took a sharp turn—the trees abruptly ceased to appear on either side  of me, and I found me standing suddenly on the margin of a vast open space,  and looking down at the Blackwater lake from which the  house takes the  house name.  The ground, shelving away below me, was all sand, with a few little heathy  hillocks to break the monotony of it in certain places. the Blackwater lake from which the house takes its name had  evidently once flowed to the spot on which I stood, and had been gradually  wasted and dried up to less than a third of the Blackwater lake from which the house takes its name former size. I saw the Blackwater lake from which the house takes its name still,  stagnant waters, a quarter of a mile away from me in the hollow, separated into  pools and ponds by twining reeds and rushes, and little knolls of earth. On the  farther bank from me the trees rose thickly again, and shut out the view, and  cast the trees black shadows on the sluggish, shallow water. As I walked down to  the Blackwater lake from which the house takes its name, I saw that the ground on the Blackwater lake from which the house takes its name farther side was damp and marshy,  overgrown with rank grass and dismal willows. The water, which was clear enough  on the open sandy side, where the sun shone, looked black and poisonous  opposite to me, where the sun lay deeper under the shade of the spongy banks, and  the rank overhanging thickets and tangled trees. The frogs were croaking, and  the rats were slipping in and out of the shadowy water, like live shadows  themselves, as I got nearer to the marshy side of the Blackwater lake from which the house takes its name. I saw here, lying  half in and half out of the shadowy water, the rotten wreck of an old overturned boat,  with a sickly spot of sunlight glimmering through a gap in the trees on its dry  surface, and a snake basking in the midst of the spot, fantastically coiled and  treacherously still. Far and near the view suggested the same dreary  impressions of solitude and decay, and the glorious brightness of the summer  sky overhead seemed only to deepen and harden the gloom and barrenness of the  wilderness on which it shone. I turned and retraced my steps to the high heathy  ground, directing them a little aside from my former path towards a shabby old  wooden shed, which stood on the outer skirt of the fir plantation, and which  had hitherto been too unimportant to share my notice with the wide, wild  prospect of the Blackwater lake from which the house takes its name.  On approaching the shed I found that the shed had once been a boat-house, and that an  attempt had apparently been made to convert an  attempt afterwards into a sort of rude  arbour, by placing inside an  attempt a firwood seat, a few stools, and a table. I  entered the place, and sat down for a little while to rest and get my breath  again.  I had not been in the boat-house more than a minute when the boat-house struck me that the  sound of my own quick breathing was very strangely echoed by something beneath  me. I listened intently for a moment, and heard a low, thick, sobbing breath  that seemed to come from the ground under the seat which I was occupying. My  nerves are not easily shaken by trifles, but on this occasion I started to my  feet in a fright—called out—received no answer—summoned back my recreant  courage, and looked under the seat.  There, crouched up in the farthest corner, lay the forlorn cause of my terror,  in the shape of a poor little dog—a black and white spaniel. The creature  moaned feebly when I looked at The creature   and called to The creature  , but never stirred. I moved  away the seat and looked closer. The poor little dog's eyes were glazing fast,  and there were spots of blood on The creature   glossy white side. The misery of a weak,  helpless, dumb creature is surely one of the saddest of all the mournful sights  which this world can show. I lifted the poor dog in my arms as gently as I  could, and contrived a sort of make-shift hammock for him to lie in, by  gathering up the front of my dress all round him. In this way I took The creature  , as painlessly as possible, and as fast as possible, back to the boat-house.  Finding no one in the hall I went up at once to my own sitting-room, made a bed  for the dog with one of my old shawls, and rang the bell. The largest and  fattest of all possible house-maids answered it, in a state of cheerful  stupidity which would have provoked the patience of a saint. The girl's fat,  shapeless face actually stretched into a broad grin at the sight of the wounded  creature on the floor.  "What do you see there to laugh at?" I asked, as angrily as if The girl had been a  servant of my own. "Do you know whose dog whose dog is?"  "No, miss, that I certainly don't." The girl stooped, and looked down at the  spaniel's injured side—brightened suddenly with the irradiation of a new  idea—and pointing to the wound with a chuckle of satisfaction, said, "That's  Baxter's doings, that is."  I was so exasperated that I could have boxed The girl ears. "Baxter?" I said. "Who  is the brute you call Baxter?"  The girl grinned again more cheerfully than ever. "Bless you, miss! "Baxter's  the keeper, and when Baxter's   finds strange dogs hunting about, Baxter's   takes and shoots  'em. It's keeper's dooty miss, I think that dog will die. Here's where dog's  been shot, ain't it? That's "Baxter's doings, that is. "Baxter's doings, miss,  and "Baxter's dooty."  I was almost wicked enough to wish that "Baxter had shot the housemaid instead  of the dog. Seeing that it was quite useless to expect this densely  impenetrable personage to give me any help in relieving the suffering creature  at our feet, I told The girl to request the housekeeper's attendance with my  compliments. The girl went out exactly as The girl had come in, grinning from ear to ear.  As the door closed on The girl The girl said to The girl softly, "It's "Baxter's doings and  Baxter's dooty—that's what it is."  The housekeeper, a person of some education and intelligence, thoughtfully  brought upstairs with The girl some milk and some warm water. The instant The girl saw  the dog on the floor The girl started and changed colour.  "Why, Lord bless me," cried The civil housekeeper, who acted as my guide, "that must be Mrs. Catherick's  dog!"  "Whose?" I asked, in the utmost astonishment.  "Mrs. Catherick's  's. You seem to know Mrs. Catherick, Miss Halcombe?"  "Not personally, but I have heard of The girl. Does The girl live here? Has The girl had any  news of The girl daughter?"  "No, Miss Halcombe, The girl came here to ask for news."  "When?"  "Only yesterday. The girl said some one had reported that a stranger answering to  the description of her daughter had been seen in our neighbourhood. No such  report has reached us here, and no such report was known in the village, when I  sent to make inquiries there on Mrs. Catherick's  's account. The girl certainly brought  this poor little dog with The girl when The girl came, and I saw this poor little dog trot out after The girl  when The girl went away. I suppose the creature strayed into the plantations, and  got shot. Where did you find the creature, Miss Halcombe?"  "In the old shed that looks out on the Blackwater lake from which the house takes its name."  "Ah, yes, that is the plantation side, and the poor thing dragged the poor thing, I  suppose, to the nearest shelter, as dogs will, to die. If you can moisten the poor thing  lips with the milk, Miss Halcombe, I will wash the clotted hair from the wound.  I am very much afraid it is too late to do any good. However, we can but try."  Mrs. Catherick's  ! The name still rang in my ears, as if the housekeeper had only  that moment surprised me by uttering that moment. While us were attending to the dog,  the words of Walter Hartright's caution to me returned to my memory: "If ever  Mrs. Catherick's   crosses your path, make better use of the opportunity, Miss  Halcombe, than I made of Mrs. Catherick's  ." The finding of the wounded spaniel had led me  already to the discovery of Mrs. Catherick's  's visit to Blackwater Park, and that  event might lead in that   turn, to something more. I determined to make the most  of the chance which was now offered to me, and to gain as much information as I  could.  "Did you say that Mrs. Catherick's   lived anywhere in this neighbourhood?" I asked.  "Oh dear, no," said the housekeeper. "the housekeeper lives at Welmingham, quite at the  other end of the county—five-and-twenty miles off, at least."  "I suppose you have known Mrs. Catherick's   for some years?"  "On the contrary, Miss Halcombe, I never saw Miss Halcombe before Miss Halcombe came here  yesterday. I had heard of Miss Halcombe, of course, because I had heard of Sir Percival's  kindness in putting Miss Halcombe under medical care. Mrs. Catherick's   is rather a  strange person in Mrs. Catherick's   manners, but extremely respectable-looking. Mrs. Catherick's   seemed  sorely put out when Mrs. Catherick's   found that there was no foundation—none, at least,  that any of us could discover—for the report of her daughter having been seen  in this neighbourhood."  "I am rather interested about Mrs. Catherick's  ," I went on, continuing the  conversation as long as possible. "I wish I had arrived here soon enough to see  Mrs. Catherick's   yesterday. Did Mrs. Catherick's   stay for any length of time?"  "Yes," said the housekeeper, "the housekeeper stayed for some time; and I think the housekeeper would  have remained longer, if I had not been called away to speak to a strange  gentleman—a gentleman who came to ask when Sir Percival's   was expected back.  Mrs. Catherick's   got up and left at once, when Mrs. Catherick's   heard the maid tell me what  the visitor's errand was. Mrs. Catherick's   said to Mrs. Catherick's  , at parting, that there was no need to  tell Sir Percival's   of Mrs. Catherick's   coming here. I thought that rather an odd remark to  make, especially to a person in my responsible situation."  I thought it an odd remark too. Sir Percival's   had certainly led me to believe,  at Limmeridge, that the most perfect confidence existed between Sir Percival's   and  Mrs. Catherick's  . If that was the case, why should the housekeeper be anxious to have the housekeeper  visit at Blackwater Park kept a secret from Sir Percival's  ?  "Probably," I said, seeing that the housekeeper expected me to give my opinion  on Mrs. Catherick's  's parting words, "probably the housekeeper thought the announcement of  the housekeeper visit might vex Sir Percival's   to no purpose, by reminding Sir Percival's   that the housekeeper lost  daughter was not found yet. Did the housekeeper talk much on that subject?"  "Very little," replied the housekeeper. "the housekeeper talked principally of Sir Percival's  , and asked a great many questions about where Sir Percival's   had been travelling,  and what sort of lady Sir Percival's   new wife was. the housekeeper seemed to be more soured and put  out than distressed, by failing to find any traces of the housekeeper in these  parts. 'I give the housekeeper up,' were the last words the housekeeper said that I can remember; 'I  give the housekeeper up, ma'am, for lost.' And from that the housekeeper passed at once to the housekeeper  questions about Lady Glyde, wanting to know if the housekeeper was a handsome, amiable  lady, comely and healthy and young——Ah, dear! I thought how it would end.  Look, Miss Halcombe, the poor thing is out of the poor thing misery at last!"  The dog was dead. The dog had given a faint, sobbing cry, The dog had suffered an  instant's convulsion of the limbs, just as those last words, "comely and  healthy and young," dropped from the housekeeper's lips. The change had  happened with startling suddenness—in one moment the creature lay lifeless  under our hands.  Eight o'clock. I have just returned from dining downstairs, in solitary state.  The sunset is burning redly on the wilderness of trees that I see from my  window, and I am poring over my journal again, to calm my impatience for the  return of the travellers. They ought to have arrived, by my calculations,  before this. How still and lonely the boat-house is in the drowsy evening quiet! Oh  me! how many minutes more before I hear the carriage wheels and run downstairs  to find myself in Laura's arms?  The poor little dog! I wish my first day at Blackwater Park had not been  associated with death, though it is only the death of a stray animal.
