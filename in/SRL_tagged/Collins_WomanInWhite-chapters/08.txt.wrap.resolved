 So ended my eventful first day at Limmeridge House.  Miss Halcombe and I kept our secret. After the discovery of the likeness no  fresh light seemed destined to break over the mystery of the woman in white. At  the first safe opportunity Halcombe Halcombe cautiously led Halcombe half-sister to  speak of their mother, of old times, and of Anne Catherick. Miss Fairlie's  recollections of the little scholar at Limmeridge were, however, only of the  most vague and general kind. Miss Fairlie's  recollections of the little scholar at Limmeridge remembered the likeness between Miss Fairlie's  recollections of the little scholar at Limmeridge and  Miss Fairlie's  recollections of the little scholar at Limmeridge mother's favourite pupil, as something which had been supposed to exist in  past times; but Miss Fairlie's  recollections of the little scholar at Limmeridge did not refer to the gift of the white dresses, or to the  singular form of words in which the child had artlessly expressed Miss Fairlie's  recollections of the little scholar at Limmeridge gratitude  for them. Miss Fairlie's  recollections of the little scholar at Limmeridge remembered that Anne had remained at Limmeridge for a few months  only, and had then left it to go back to Miss Fairlie's  recollections of the little scholar at Limmeridge home in Hampshire; but Miss Fairlie's  recollections of the little scholar at Limmeridge could  not say whether the mother and daughter had ever returned, or had ever been  heard of afterwards. No further search, on Halcombe's part, through the  few letters of Miss Fairlie's  's writing which Miss Fairlie's   had left unread, assisted in  clearing up the uncertainties still left to perplex us. us had identified the  unhappy woman whom I had met in the night-time with Anne Catherick—us had  made some advance, at least, towards connecting the probably defective  condition of the poor creature's intellect with the peculiarity of Miss Fairlie's  recollections of the little scholar at Limmeridge being  dressed all in white, and with the continuance, in Miss Fairlie's  recollections of the little scholar at Limmeridge maturer years, of Miss Fairlie's  recollections of the little scholar at Limmeridge  childish gratitude towards Mrs. Fairlie—and there, so far as us knew at that  time, us discoveries had ended.   The days passed on, the weeks passed on, and the track of the golden autumn  wound the weeks bright way visibly through the green summer of the trees. Peaceful,  fast-flowing, happy time! my story glides by you now as swiftly as you once  glided by me. Of all the treasures of enjoyment that you poured so freely into  my heart, how much is left me that has purpose and value enough to be written  on this page? Nothing but the saddest of all confessions that a man can  make—the confession of a man own folly.  The secret which that confession discloses should be told with little effort,  for it has indirectly escaped me already. The poor weak words, which have  failed to describe Miss Fairlie, have succeeded in betraying the sensations she  awakened in me. It is so with us all. us all words are giants when Our words do us all an  injury, and dwarfs when Our words do us all a service.  I loved she.  Ah! how well I know all the sadness and all the mockery that is contained in  those three words. I can sigh over my mournful confession with the tenderest  woman who reads it and pities me. I can laugh at it as bitterly as the hardest  man who tosses it from him in contempt. I loved she! Feel for me, or despise  me, I confess it with the same immovable resolution to own the truth.  Was there no excuse for me? There was some excuse to be found, surely, in the  conditions under which my term of hired service was passed at Limmeridge House.  My morning hours succeeded each other calmly in the quiet and seclusion of my  own room. I had just work enough to do, in mounting my employer's drawings, to  keep my hands and eyes pleasurably employed, while my mind was left free to  enjoy the dangerous luxury of   own unbridled thoughts. A perilous solitude,  for   lasted long enough to enervate, not long enough to fortify me. A  perilous solitude, for   was followed by afternoons and evenings spent, day  after day and week after week alone in the society of two women, one of whom  possessed all the accomplishments of grace, wit, and high-breeding, the other  all the charms of beauty, gentleness, and simple truth, that can purify and  subdue the heart of man. Not a day passed, in that dangerous intimacy of  teacher and pupil, in which my hand was not close to Miss Fairlie's; my cheek,  as we bent together over her sketch-book, almost touching hers. The more  attentively her watched every movement of my brush, the more closely I was  breathing the perfume of her hair, and the warm fragrance of her breath. It was  part of my service to live in the very light of her eyes—at one time to be  bending over her, so close to her bosom as to tremble at the thought of  touching it; at another, to feel her bending over her, bending so close to see  what I was about, that her voice sank low when her spoke to her, and her ribbons  brushed my cheek in the wind before her could draw her ribbons   back.  The evenings which followed the sketching excursions of the afternoon varied,  rather than checked, these innocent, these inevitable familiarities. My natural  fondness for the music which her played with such tender feeling, such delicate  womanly taste, and her natural enjoyment of giving me back, by the practice of  her art, the pleasure which I had offered to her by the practice of mine, only  wove another tie which drew us closer and closer to one another. The accidents  of conversation; the simple habits which regulated even such a little thing as  the position of our places at table; the play of Miss Halcombe's ever-ready  raillery, always directed against my anxiety as teacher, while it sparkled over  her enthusiasm as pupil; the harmless expression of poor Mrs. Vesey's drowsy  approval, which connected Miss Fairlie and me as two model young people who  never disturbed her—every one of these trifles, and many more, combined to  fold us together in the same domestic atmosphere, and to lead us both  insensibly to the same hopeless end.  I should have remembered my position, and have put myself secretly on my guard.  I did so, but not till it was too late. All the discretion, all the experience,  which had availed me with other women, and secured me against other  temptations, failed me with her. It had been my profession, for years past, to  be in this close contact with young girls of all ages, and of all orders of  beauty. I had accepted my position as part of my calling in life; I had  trained myself to leave all the sympathies natural to my age in my employer's  outer hall, as coolly as I left my umbrella there before I went upstairs. I had  long since learnt to understand, composedly and as a matter of course, that my  situation in life was considered a guarantee against any of my female pupils  feeling more than the most ordinary interest in myself, and that I was admitted  among beautiful and captivating women much as a harmless domestic animal is  admitted among women. This guardian experience I had gained early; this guardian  experience had sternly and strictly guided me straight along my own poor narrow  path, without once letting me stray aside, to the right hand or to the left.  And now I and my trusty talisman were parted for the first time. Yes, my  hardly-earned self-control was as completely lost to myself as if I had never  possessed my  hardly-earned self-control; lost to myself, as my  hardly-earned self-control is lost every day to other men, in other  critical situations, where women are concerned. I know, now, that I should have  questioned myself from the first. I should have asked why any room in the house  was better than home to myself when she entered any room in the house  , and barren as a desert when she  went out again—why I always noticed and remembered the little changes in she  dress that I had noticed and remembered in no other woman's before—why I saw  she, heard she, and touched she (when we shook hands at night and morning) as I  had never seen, heard, and touched any other woman in my life? I should have  looked into my own heart, and found this new growth springing up there, and  plucked this new growth out while this new growth was young. Why was this easiest, simplest work of  self-culture always too much for myself? The explanation has been written already  in the three words that were many enough, and plain enough, for my confession.  I loved she.  The days passed, the weeks passed; the weeks was approaching the third month of my  stay in Cumberland. The delicious monotony of life in our calm seclusion flowed  on with myself, like a smooth stream with a swimmer who glides down the current.  All memory of the past, all thought of the future, all sense of the falseness  and hopelessness of my own position, lay hushed within myself into deceitful rest.  Lulled by the Syren-song that my own heart sung to myself, with eyes shut to all  sight, and ears closed to all sound of danger, I drifted nearer and nearer to  the fatal rocks. The warning that aroused me at last, and startled me into  sudden, self-accusing consciousness of my own weakness, was the plainest, the  truest, the kindest of all warnings, for it came silently from HER.  our had parted one night as usual. No word had fallen from my lips, at that time  or at any time before No word, that could betray me, or startle HER into sudden  knowledge of the truth. But when our met again in the morning, a change had come  over HER—a change that told me all.  I shrank then—I shrink still—from invading the innermost sanctuary of HER  heart, and laying the innermost sanctuary of her  heart open to others, as I have laid open my own. Let the innermost sanctuary of her  heart be  enough to say that the time when HER first surprised my secret was, I firmly  believe, the time when HER first surprised HER own, and the time, also, when  HER changed towards me in the interval of one night. HER nature, too truthful  to deceive others, was too noble to deceive Her nature, too truthful  to deceive others. When the doubt that I had  hushed asleep first laid Her nature, too truthful  to deceive others weary weight on HER heart, the true face owned  all, and said, in the true face own frank, simple language—I am sorry for him; I am  sorry for me.  It said this, and more, which I could not then interpret. I understood but too  well the change in HER manner, to greater kindness and quicker readiness in  interpreting all my wishes, before others—to constraint and sadness, and  nervous anxiety to absorb HER in the first occupation HER could seize on,  whenever we happened to be left together alone. I understood why the sweet  sensitive lips smiled so rarely and so restrainedly now, and why the clear blue  eyes looked at me, sometimes with the pity of an angel, sometimes with the  innocent perplexity of a child. But the change meant more than this. There was  a coldness in her hand, there was an unnatural immobility in her face, there  was in all her movements the mute expression of constant fear and clinging  self-reproach. The sensations that I could trace to her and to me, the  unacknowledged sensations that we were feeling in common, were not these. There  were certain elements of the change in her that were still secretly drawing we  together, and others that were, as secretly, beginning to drive we apart.  In my doubt and perplexity, in my vague suspicion of something hidden which I  was left to find by my own unaided efforts, I examined Miss Halcombe's looks  and manner for enlightenment. Living in such intimacy as ours, no serious  alteration could take place in any one of us which did not sympathetically  affect the others. The change in Miss Fairlie was reflected in Miss Fairlie half-sister.  Although not a word escaped Miss Halcombe which hinted at an altered state of  feeling towards me, Miss Fairlie penetrating eyes had contracted a new habit of  always watching me. Sometimes the look was like suppressed anger, sometimes  like suppressed dread, sometimes like neither—like nothing, in short, which I  could understand. A week elapsed, leaving us all three still in this position  of secret constraint towards one another. My situation, aggravated by the sense  of my own miserable weakness and forgetfulness of me, now too late awakened  in me, was becoming intolerable. I felt that I must cast off the oppression  under which I was living, at once and for ever—yet how to act for the best,  or what to say first, was more than I could tell.  From this position of helplessness and humiliation I was rescued by Miss  Halcombe. Her lips told me the bitter, the necessary, the unexpected truth; Her  hearty kindness sustained me under the shock of hearing it; Her sense and  courage turned to it right use an event which threatened the worst that could  happen, to me and to others, in Limmeridge House.
