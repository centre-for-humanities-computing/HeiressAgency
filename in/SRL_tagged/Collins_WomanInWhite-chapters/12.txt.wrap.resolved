 The exposed situation of the churchyard had obliged me to be cautious in  choosing the position that I was to occupy.  The main entrance to the church was on the side next to the burial-ground, and  the door was screened by a porch walled in on either side. After some little  hesitation, caused by natural reluctance to conceal myself, indispensable as  that concealment was to the object in view, I had resolved on entering a porch walled in on either side. A loophole window was pierced in each of A loophole window side walls. Through one of  these windows I could see Mrs. Fairlie's grave. The other looked towards the  stone quarry in which the sexton's cottage was built. Before myself, fronting the  porch entrance, was a patch of bare burial-ground, a line of low stone wall,  and a strip of lonely brown hill, with the sunset clouds sailing heavily over  it before the strong, steady wind. No living creature was visible or  audible—no bird flew by myself, no dog barked from the sexton's cottage. The  pauses in the dull beating of the surf were filled up by the dreary rustling of  the dwarf trees near the grave, and the cold faint bubble of the brook over its  stony bed. A dreary scene and a dreary hour. My spirits sank fast as I counted  out the minutes of the evening in my hiding-place under the church porch.  It was not twilight yet—the light of the setting sun still lingered in the  heavens, and little more than the first half-hour of my solitary watch had  elapsed—when I heard footsteps and a voice. The footsteps were approaching  from the other side of the church, and a voice was a woman's.  "Don't you fret, my dear, about the letter," said a voice. "I gave a voice to the  lad quite safe, and the lad he took a voice from myself without a word. he went he way  and I went mine, and not a living soul followed me afterwards—that I'll  warrant."  These words strung up my attention to a pitch of expectation that was almost  painful. There was a pause of silence, but The footsteps still advanced. In  another moment two persons, both women, passed within my range of view from the  porch window. both women were walking straight towards the grave; and therefore both women  had both women backs turned towards myself.  One of both women was dressed in a bonnet and shawl. The other wore a long  travelling-cloak of a dark-blue colour, with the hood drawn over her head. A  few inches of her gown were visible below a long  travelling-cloak of a dark-blue colour. My heart beat fast as I  noted the colour—My heart was white.  After advancing about half-way between the church and the grave they stopped,  and the woman in a long  travelling-cloak of a dark-blue colour turned the woman in the cloak towards the woman in the cloak companion. But the woman in the cloak side  face, which a bonnet might now have allowed me to see, was hidden by the heavy,  projecting edge of the hood.  "Mind you keep a long  travelling-cloak of a dark-blue colour on," said the same voice which I had  already heard—the voice of the woman in the cloak in the shawl. "Mrs. Todd is right about  your looking too particular, yesterday, all in white. I'll walk about a little  while you're here, churchyards being not at all in my way, whatever all in white may be  in yours. Finish what you want to do before I come back, and let us be sure and  get home again before night."  With those words she turned about, and retracing she steps, advanced with she  face towards me. It was the face of an elderly woman, brown, rugged, and  healthy, with nothing dishonest or suspicious in the look of it. Close to the  church she stopped to pull she shawl closer round she.  "Queer," she said to she, "always queer, with she whims and she ways, ever  since I can remember she. Harmless, though—as harmless, poor soul, as a  little child."  she sighed—looked about the burial-ground nervously—shook she head, as if  the dreary prospect by no means pleased she, and disappeared round the corner  of the  church.  I doubted for a moment whether I ought to follow and speak to she or not. My  intense anxiety to find myself face to face with she companion helped me to  decide in the negative. I could ensure seeing she in her shawl by waiting  near the churchyard until she came back—although it seemed more than doubtful  whether she could give me the information of which I was in search. The person  who had delivered the letter was of little consequence. The person  who had delivered the letter the letter was the one centre of interest, and the one source of information,  and that person I now felt convinced was before myself in the churchyard.  While these ideas were passing through my mind I saw the woman in the cloak  approach close to the grave, and stand looking at the grave for a little while. the woman in the cloak    then glanced all round the woman in the cloak  , and taking a white linen cloth or handkerchief from  under the cloak  , turned aside towards the brook. The little stream ran into the churchyard under a tiny archway in the bottom of the wall, and ran out again,  after a winding course of a few dozen yards, under a similar opening. the woman in the cloak    dipped a white linen cloth or handkerchief in the water, and returned to the grave. I saw the woman in the cloak   kiss the  white cross, then kneel down before the inscription, and apply the woman in the cloak   wet cloth to  the cleansing of the inscription.  After considering how I could show myself with the least possible chance of  frightening the woman in the cloak  , I resolved to cross the wall before myself, to skirt round the wall  outside, and to enter the churchyard again by the stile near the grave, in  order that the woman in the cloak   might see me as I approached. the woman in the cloak   was so absorbed over the woman in the cloak    employment that the woman in the cloak   did not hear me coming until I had stepped over the stile.  Then the woman in the cloak   looked up, started to the woman in the cloak   feet with a faint cry, and stood facing me  in speechless and motionless terror.  "Don't be frightened," I said. "Surely you remember me?"  I stopped while I spoke—then advanced a few steps gently—then stopped  again—and so approached by little and little till I was close to the woman in the cloak  . If  there had been any doubt still left in my mind,   must have been now set at  rest. There, speaking affrightedly for  —there was the same face  confronting me over Mrs. Fairlie's grave which had first looked into mine on  the high-road by night.  "You remember me?" I said. "We met very late, and I helped you to find the way  to London. Surely you have not forgotten that?"  Her features relaxed, and Her drew a heavy breath of relief. I saw the new life  of recognition stirring slowly under the death-like stillness which fear had  set on Her face.  "Don't attempt to speak to me just yet," I went on. "Take time to recover  me—take time to feel quite certain that I am a friend."  "You are very kind to me," Her murmured. "As kind now as you were then."  Her stopped, and I kept silence on my side. I was not granting time for  composure to Her only, I was gaining time also for me. Under the wan wild  evening light, that woman and I were met together again, a grave between us,  the dead about us, the lonesome hills closing us round on every side. The time,  the place, the circumstances under which us now stood face to face in the  evening stillness of that dreary valley—the lifelong interests which might  hang suspended on the next chance words that passed between us—the sense  that, for aught I knew to the contrary, the whole future of Laura Fairlie's  life might be determined, for good or for evil, by my winning or losing the  confidence of the forlorn creature who stood trembling by Laura Fairlie's mother's  grave—all threatened to shake the steadiness and the self-control on which  every inch of the progress I might yet make now depended. I tried hard, as I  felt this, to possess me of all my resources; I did my utmost to turn the  few moments for reflection to the best account.  "Are you calmer now?" I said, as soon as I thought it time to speak again. "Can  you talk to me without feeling frightened, and without forgetting that I am a  friend?"  "How did you come here?" I am a  friend asked, without noticing what I had just said to  I am a  friend.  "Don't you remember my telling you, when we last met, that I was going to  Cumberland? I have been in Cumberland ever since—I have been staying all the  time at Limmeridge House."  "At Limmeridge House!" I am a  friend pale face brightened as I am a  friend repeated the words, I am a  friend  wandering eyes fixed on me with a sudden interest. "Ah, how happy you must have  been!" I am a  friend said, looking at me eagerly, without a shadow of its former distrust  left in I am a  friend expression.  I took advantage of I am a  friend newly-aroused confidence in me to observe Her pale face,  with an attention and a curiosity which I had hitherto restrained me from  showing, for caution's sake. I looked at I am a  friend, with my mind full of that other  lovely face which had so ominously recalled I am a  friend to my memory on the terrace by  moonlight. I had seen Anne Catherick's likeness in Miss Fairlie. I now saw Miss  Fairlie's likeness in —saw it all the more clearly because the  points of dissimilarity between the two were presented to me as well as the  points of resemblance. In the general outline of the countenance and general  proportion of the features—in the colour of the hair and in the little  nervous uncertainty about the lips—in the height and size of the figure, and  the carriage of the head and body, Fairlie's likeness in Anne Catherick— appeared even more startling  than I had ever felt Fairlie's likeness in Anne Catherick— to be yet. But there the resemblance ended, and the  dissimilarity, in details, began. The delicate beauty of Miss Fairlie's  complexion, the transparent clearness of her eyes, the smooth purity of her  skin, the tender bloom of colour on her lips, were all missing from the worn  weary face that was now turned towards mine. Although I hated me even for  thinking such a thing, still, while I looked at she before me, the idea  would force the idea   into my mind that one sad change, in the future, was all  that was wanting to make Fairlie's likeness in Anne Catherick— complete, which I now saw to be so  imperfect in detail. If ever sorrow and suffering set ever sorrow and suffering profaning marks on  the youth and beauty of Miss Fairlie's face, then, and then only, Anne  Catherick and Anne   would be the twin-sisters of chance resemblance, the living  reflections of one another.  I shuddered at the thought. There was something horrible in the blind  unreasoning distrust of the future which the mere passage of it through my mind  seemed to imply. It was a welcome interruption to be roused by feeling Anne  Catherick's hand laid on my shoulder. The touch was as stealthy and as sudden  as that other touch which had petrified me from head to foot on the night when  we first met.  "You are looking at me, and you are thinking of something," Anne   said, with Anne    strange breathless rapidity of utterance. "What is it?"  "Nothing extraordinary," I answered. "I was only wondering how you came here."  "I came with a friend who is very good to me. I have only been here two days."  "And you found your way to this place yesterday?"  "How do you know that?"  "I only guessed it."  Anne   turned from me, and knelt down before the inscription once more.  "Where should I go if not here?" Anne   said. "The friend who was better than a  mother to me is the only friend I have to visit at Limmeridge. Oh, it makes my  heart ache to see a stain on Anne   tomb! It ought to be kept white as snow, for  Anne   sake. I was tempted to begin cleaning It yesterday, and I can't help coming  back to go on with It to-day. Is there anything wrong in that? I hope not.  Surely nothing can be wrong that I do for Mrs. Fairlie's sake?"  The old grateful sense of Mrs. Fairlie benefactress's kindness was evidently the ruling  idea still in the poor creature's mind—the narrow mind which had but too  plainly opened to no other lasting impression since that first impression of  Mrs. Fairlie younger and happier days. I saw that my best chance of winning Mrs. Fairlie  confidence lay in encouraging Mrs. Fairlie to proceed with the artless employment which  Mrs. Fairlie had come into the burial-ground to pursue. Mrs. Fairlie resumed my best chance of winning her  confidence lay in encouraging her to proceed with the artless employment which  she had come into the burial-ground to pursue at once, on my  telling Mrs. Fairlie Mrs. Fairlie might do so, touching the hard marble as tenderly as if the hard marble had  been a sentient thing, and whispering the words of the inscription to Mrs. Fairlie,  over and over again, as if the lost days of Mrs. Fairlie girlhood had returned and Mrs. Fairlie  was patiently learning Mrs. Fairlie lesson once more at Mrs. Fairlie's knees.  "Should you wonder very much," I said, preparing the way as cautiously as I  could for the questions that were to come, "if I owned that it is a  satisfaction to me, as well as a surprise, to see you here? I felt very uneasy  about you after you left me in the cab."  Mrs. Fairlie looked up quickly and suspiciously.  "Uneasy," Mrs. Fairlie repeated. "Why?"  "A strange thing happened after we parted that night. Two men overtook me in a  chaise. Two men did not see where I was standing, but Two men stopped near me, and  spoke to a policeman on the other side of the way."  Mrs. Fairlie instantly suspended Mrs. Fairlie employment. The hand holding the damp cloth with  which Mrs. Fairlie had been cleaning the inscription dropped to Mrs. Fairlie side. The hand holding the damp cloth with  which she had been cleaning the inscription dropped to her sidegrasped the marble cross at the head of the grave. Mrs. Fairlie face turned towards me  slowly, with the blank look of terror set rigidly on it once more. I went on at  all hazards—it was too late now to draw back.  "Two men spoke to the policeman," I said, "and asked the policeman if the policeman had seen  you. the policeman had not seen you; and then one of Two men spoke again, and said you had  escaped from the policeman Asylum."  Mrs. Fairlie sprang to Mrs. Fairlie as if my last words had set the pursuers on Mrs. Fairlie track.  "Stop! and hear the end," I cried. "Stop! and you shall know how I befriended  you. A word from me would have told Two men which way you had gone—and I  never spoke A word from me. I helped your escape—I made A word from me safe and certain.  Think, try to think. Try to understand what I tell you."  My manner seemed to influence Mrs. Fairlie more than my words. Mrs. Fairlie made an effort to  grasp the new idea. Mrs. Fairlie hands shifted the damp cloth hesitatingly from one to  the other, exactly as Her hands had shifted the little travelling-bag on the night  when I first saw Mrs. Fairlie. Slowly the purpose of my words seemed to force its way  through the confusion and agitation of Mrs. Fairlie mind. Slowly Mrs. Fairlie features relaxed,  and Mrs. Fairlie eyes looked at me with their expression gaining in curiosity what it  was fast losing in fear.  "YOU don't think I ought to be back in the Asylum, do you?" Mrs. Fairlie said.  "Certainly not. I am glad you escaped from it—I am glad I helped you."  "Yes, yes, you did help me indeed; you helped me at the hard part," Mrs. Fairlie went on  a little vacantly. "It was easy to escape, or I should not have got away. They  never suspected me as They suspected the others. I was so quiet, and so  obedient, and so easily frightened. The finding London was the hard part, and  there you helped me. Did I thank you at the time? I thank you now very kindly."  "Was the Asylum far from where you met me? Come! show that you believe me to be  your friend, and tell me where it was."  Mrs. Fairlie mentioned the place—a private Asylum, as the place situation informed me; a  private Asylum not very far from the spot where I had seen Mrs. Fairlieand then, with  evident suspicion of the use to which I might put Mrs. Fairlie answer, anxiously  repeated Mrs. Fairlie former inquiry, "You don't think I ought to be taken back, do you?"  "Once again, I am glad you escaped—I am glad you prospered well after you  left me," I answered. "You said you had a friend in London to go to. Did you  find a friend in London to go?"  "Yes. It was very late, but there was a girl up at needle-work in the house,  and a girl helped me to rouse Mrs. Clements. Mrs. Clements is a friend in London to go. A good,  kind woman, but not like Mrs. Fairlie. Ah no, nobody is like Mrs. Fairlie!"  "Is Mrs. Clements an old friend of yours? Have you known Mrs. Clements a long time?"  "Yes, Mrs. Clements was a neighbour of ours once, at home, in Hampshire, and liked me,  and took care of Mrs. Clements when I was a little girl. Years ago, when Mrs. Clements went away  from ours, Mrs. Clements wrote down in my Prayer-book for Mrs. Clements where Mrs. Clements was going to live in  London, and Mrs. Clements said, 'If you are ever in trouble, Mrs. Clements, come to Mrs. Clements. I have no  husband alive to say me nay, and no children to look after, and I will take  care of Mrs. Clements.' Kind words, were they not? I suppose I remember they because they  were kind. It's little enough I remember besides—little enough, little  enough!"  "Had you no father or mother to take care of Mrs. Clements?"  "Father?—I never saw him—I never heard mother speak of him. Father? Ah,  dear! him is dead, I suppose."  "And your mother?"  "I don't get on well with Mrs. Clements. We are a trouble and a fear to each other."  A trouble and a fear to each other! At those words the suspicion crossed my  mind, for the first time, that Mrs. Clements mother might be the person who had placed  her mother under restraint.  "Don't ask me about mother," Mrs. Clements went on. "I'd rather talk of Mrs. Clements.  Mrs. Clements is like you, Mrs. Clements doesn't think that I ought to be back in the  Asylum, and Mrs. Clements is as glad as you are that I escaped from it. Mrs. Clements cried over my  misfortune, and said it must be kept secret from everybody."  Mrs. Clements "misfortune." In what sense was Mrs. Clements using that word? In a sense which might  explain Mrs. Clements motive in writing the anonymous letter? In a sense which might show  it to be the too common and too customary motive that has led many a woman to  interpose anonymous hindrances to the marriage of the man who has ruined Mrs. Clements? I  resolved to attempt the clearing up of this doubt before more words passed  between us on either side.  "What misfortune?" I asked.  "The misfortune of my being shut up," my answered, with every appearance of  feeling surprised at my question. "What other misfortune could there be?"  I determined to persist, as delicately and forbearingly as possible. It was of  very great importance that I should be absolutely sure of every step in the  investigation which I now gained in advance.  "There is another misfortune," I said, "to which a woman may be liable, and by  which a woman may suffer lifelong sorrow and shame."  "What is it?" a woman asked eagerly.  "The misfortune of believing too innocently in a woman own virtue, and in the faith  and honour of the man a woman loves," I answered.  a woman looked up at my with the artless bewilderment of a child. Not the slightest  confusion or change of colour—not the faintest trace of any secret  consciousness of shame struggling to the surface appeared in a woman face—that  face which betrayed every other emotion with such transparent clearness. No  words that ever were spoken could have assured me, as a woman look and manner now  assured me, that the motive which I had assigned for a woman writing the anonymous letter and  sending the anonymous letter to Miss Fairlie was plainly and distinctly the wrong one. That  doubt, at any rate, was now set at rest; but the very removal of it opened a  new prospect of uncertainty. The letter, as I knew from positive testimony,  pointed at Sir Percival Glyde, though it did not name Sir Percival Glyde. a woman must have had  some strong motive, originating in some deep sense of injury, for secretly  denouncing Sir Percival Glyde to Miss Fairlie in such terms as a woman had employed, and that  motive was unquestionably not to be traced to the loss of a woman innocence and a woman  character. Whatever wrong Sir Percival Glyde might have inflicted on a woman was not of that  nature. Of what nature could it be?  "I don't understand you," a woman said, after evidently trying hard, and trying in  vain, to discover the meaning of the words I had last said to a woman.  "Never mind," I answered. "Let us go on with what us were talking about. Tell  me how long you stayed with Mrs. Clements, and how you came here."  "How long?" a woman repeated. "I stayed with Mrs. Clements till we both came to  this place, two days ago."  "You are living in the village, then?" I said. "It is strange I should not have  heard of you, though you have only been here two days."  "No, no, not in the village. Three miles away at a farm. Do you know a farm?  They call a farm Todd's Corner."  I remembered this place perfectly—we had often passed by this place in we drives. this place  was one of the oldest farms in the neighbourhood, situated in a solitary,  sheltered spot, inland at the junction of two hills.  "They are relations of Mrs. Clements at Todd's Corner," Mrs. Clements went on, "and They  had often asked Mrs. Clements to go and see They. Mrs. Clements said Mrs. Clements would go, and take me with  Mrs. Clements, for the quiet and the fresh air. It was very kind, was it not? I would  have gone anywhere to be quiet, and safe, and out of the way. But when I heard  that Todd's Corner was near Limmeridge—oh! I was so happy I would have walked  all the way barefoot to get there, and see the schools and the village and  Limmeridge House again. the schools and the village and  Limmeridge House are very good people at Todd's Corner. I hope I  shall stay there a long time. There is only one thing I don't like about the schools and the village and  Limmeridge House,  and don't like about Mrs. Clements——"  "What is it?"  "They will tease me about dressing all in white—They say it looks so  particular. How do They know? Mrs. Fairlie knew best. Mrs. Fairlie would never  have made me wear this ugly blue cloak! Ah! Mrs. Fairlie was fond of white in Mrs. Fairlie  lifetime, and here is white stone about Mrs. Fairlie grave—and I am making it whiter  for Mrs. Fairlie sake. Mrs. Fairlie often wore white Mrs. Fairlie, and Mrs. Fairlie always dressed Mrs. Fairlie little  daughter in white. Is Miss Fairlie well and happy? Does Mrs. Fairlie wear white now, as  Mrs. Fairlie used when Mrs. Fairlie was a girl?"  Mrs. Fairlie voice sank when Mrs. Fairlie put the questions about Miss Fairlie, and Mrs. Fairlie turned  Mrs. Fairlie head farther and farther away from Mrs. Fairlie. I thought I detected, in the  alteration of Mrs. Fairlie manner, an uneasy consciousness of the risk Mrs. Fairlie had run in  sending the anonymous letter, and I instantly determined so to frame my answer  as to surprise Mrs. Fairlie into owning my answer  .  "Miss Fairlie was not very well or very happy this morning," I said.  Miss Fairlie murmured a few words, but they were spoken so confusedly, and in such a low  tone, that I could not even guess at what they meant.  "Did you ask me why Miss Fairlie Miss Fairlie was neither well nor happy this morning?" I  continued.  "No," Miss Fairlie said quickly and eagerly—"oh no, I never asked that."  "I will tell you without your asking," I went on. "Miss Fairlie Miss Fairlie has received  your letter."  Miss Fairlie had been down on Miss Fairlie knees for some little time past, carefully removing  the last weather-stains left about the inscription while we were speaking  together. The first sentence of the words I had just addressed to Miss Fairlie made Miss Fairlie  pause in Miss Fairlie occupation, and turn slowly without rising from her knees, so as  to face me. The first sentence of the words I had just addressed to her literally petrified Miss Fairlie. The cloth Miss Fairlie had been  holding dropped from Miss Fairlie hands—Miss Fairlie lips fell apart—all the little colour  that there was naturally in Miss Fairlie face left there was naturally in her face in an instant.  "How do you know?" Miss Fairlie said faintly. "Who showed there was naturally in her face to you?" The blood rushed  back into her face—rushed overwhelmingly, as the sense rushed upon Miss Fairlie mind  that Miss Fairlie own words had betrayed Miss Fairlie. Miss Fairlie struck her hands together in despair.  "I never wrote it," Miss Fairlie gasped affrightedly; "I know nothing about it!"  "Yes," I said, "you wrote it, and you know about it. it was wrong to send such  a letter, it was wrong to frighten Miss Fairlie. If you had anything to say  that it was right and necessary for Miss Fairlie to hear, you should have gone yourself  to Limmeridge House—you should have spoken to Miss Fairlie with your own  lips."  Miss Fairlie crouched down over the flat stone of the grave, till her face was hidden on  it, and made no reply.  "Miss Fairlie will be as good and kind to yourself as her mother was, if you mean  well," I went on. "Miss Fairlie will keep your secret, and not let you come to  any harm. Will you see Miss Fairlie to-morrow at the farm? Will you meet Miss Fairlie in the  garden at Limmeridge House?"  "Oh, if I could die, and be hidden and at rest with YOU!" Miss Fairlie lips murmured the  words close on the grave-stone, murmured the  words close on the grave-stone in tones of passionate  endearment, to the dead remains beneath. "You know how I love your child, for  your sake! Oh, Miss Fairlie! Mrs. Fairlie! tell me how to save Mrs. Fairlie. Be my  darling and her mother once more, and tell me what to do for the best."  I heard Her lips kissing the stone—I saw her hands beating on it  passionately. The sound and the sight deeply affected me. I stooped down, and  took her hands tenderly in mine, and tried to soothe Mrs. Fairlie.  It was useless. Mrs. Fairlie snatched her hands from me, and never moved Mrs. Fairlie face from  the stone. Seeing the urgent necessity of quieting Mrs. Fairlie at any hazard and by any  means, I appealed to the only anxiety that Mrs. Fairlie appeared to feel, in connection  with me and with my opinion of Mrs. Fairlie—the anxiety to convince me of Mrs. Fairlie fitness  to be mistress of Mrs. Fairlie own actions.  "Come, come," I said gently. "Try to compose yourself, or you will make me  alter my opinion of yourself. Don't let me think that the person who put you in the  Asylum might have had some excuse——"  The next words died away on Her lips. The instant I risked that chance reference  to the person who had put Mrs. Fairlie in the  Asylum Mrs. Fairlie sprang up on Mrs. Fairlie knees. A most  extraordinary and startling change passed over Mrs. Fairlie. Mrs. Fairlie face, at all ordinary  times so touching to look at, in its nervous sensitiveness, weakness, and  uncertainty, became suddenly darkened by an expression of maniacally intense  hatred and fear, which communicated a wild, unnatural force to every feature.  Mrs. Fairlie eyes dilated in the dim evening light, like Her eyes. Mrs. Fairlie  caught up the cloth that had fallen at Mrs. Fairlie side, as if She   had been a living  creature that Mrs. Fairlie could kill, and crushed She   in both her hands with such  convulsive strength, that the few drops of moisture left in She   trickled down on  the stone beneath Mrs. Fairlie.  "Talk of something else," Mrs. Fairlie said, whispering through Mrs. Fairlie teeth. "I shall lose  Mrs. Fairlie if you talk of that."  Every vestige of the gentler thoughts which had filled Mrs. Fairlie mind hardly a minute  since seemed to be swept from a minute   now. It was evident that the impression left  by Mrs. Fairlie's kindness was not, as I had supposed, the only strong  impression on Mrs. Fairlie memory. With the grateful remembrance of Mrs. Fairlie school-days at  Limmeridge, there existed the vindictive remembrance of the wrong inflicted on  Mrs. Fairlie by Mrs. Fairlie confinement in the  Asylum. Who had done that wrong? Could it really  be Mrs. Fairlie mother?  It was hard to give up pursuing the inquiry to that final point, but I forced  Mrs. Fairlie to abandon all idea of continuing it. Seeing Mrs. Fairlie as I saw Mrs. Fairlie now, it  would have been cruel to think of anything but the necessity and the humanity  of restoring Mrs. Fairlie composure.  "I will talk of nothing to distress you," I said soothingly.  "You want something," Mrs. Fairlie answered sharply and suspiciously. "Don't look at me  like that. Speak to Mrs. Fairlie—tell me what you want."  "I only want you to quiet yourself, and when you are calmer, to think over what  I have said."  "Said?" Mrs. Fairlie paused—twisted the cloth in Mrs. Fairlie hands, backwards and forwards,  and whispered to Mrs. Fairlie, "What is it he said?" Mrs. Fairlie turned again towards Mrs. Fairlie,  and shook Mrs. Fairlie head impatiently. "Why don't you help me?" Mrs. Fairlie asked, with angry  suddenness.  "Yes, yes," I said, "I will help you, and you will soon remember. I ask you to  see Miss Fairlie to-morrow and to tell Mrs. Fairlie the truth about the letter."  "Ah! Miss FairlieMiss Fairlie—Fairlie——"  The mere utterance of the loved familiar name seemed to quiet Mrs. Fairlie. Mrs. Fairlie face  softened and grew like Her face   again.  "You need have no fear of Miss Fairlie," I continued, "and no fear of getting  into trouble through the letter. Mrs. Fairlie knows so much about it already, that you  will have no difficulty in telling Mrs. Fairlie all. There can be little necessity for  concealment where there is hardly anything left to conceal. You mention no  names in the letter; but Miss Fairlie knows that the person you write of is Sir  Percival Glyde——"  The instant I pronounced that name Miss Fairlie started to Miss Fairlie feet, and a scream burst  from Miss Fairlie that rang through the churchyard, and made my heart leap in me with  the terror of it. The dark deformity of the expression which had just left Miss Fairlie  face lowered on The dark deformity of the expression which had just left her  face once more, with doubled and trebled intensity. The shriek at  the name, the reiterated look of hatred and fear that instantly followed, told  all. Not even a last doubt now remained. her mother was guiltless of  imprisoning her mother in the  Asylum. A man had shut her mother up—and A man was Sir  Percival Glyde.  The scream had reached other ears than mine. On one side I heard the door of  the sexton's cottage open; on the other I heard the voice of her mother companion, the  woman in the shawl, the woman whom her mother had spoken of as Mrs. Clements.  "I'm coming! I'm coming!" cried the voice from behind the clump of dwarf trees.  In a moment more Mrs. Clements hurried into view.  "Who are you?" Mrs. Clements cried, facing me resolutely as Mrs. Clements set Mrs. Clements foot on the  stile. "How dare you frighten a poor helpless woman like that?"  Mrs. Clements was at Anne Catherick's side, and had put one arm around Mrs. Clements, before I  could answer. "What is it, my dear?" Mrs. Clements said. "What has A man done to you?"  "Nothing," the poor creature answered. "Nothing. I'm only frightened."  Mrs. Clements turned on Mrs. Clements with a fearless indignation, for which I respected  Mrs. Clements.  "I should be heartily ashamed of Mrs. Clements if I deserved that angry look," I said.  "But I do not deserve it. I have unfortunately startled Mrs. Clements without intending  it. This is not the first time Mrs. Clements has seen me. Ask Mrs. Clements you, and Mrs. Clements will  tell you that I am incapable of willingly harming Mrs. Clements or any woman."  I spoke distinctly, so that Anne Catherick's might hear and understand me, and I  saw that the words and Anne Catherick might hear and understand me meaning had reached Anne Catherick's.  "Yes, yes," Mrs. Clements said—"he was good to Mrs. Clements once—Mrs. Clements helped me——" Mrs. Clements  whispered the rest into Mrs. Clements friend's ear.  "Strange, indeed!" said Mrs. Clements, with a look of perplexity. "It makes all  the difference, though. I'm sorry I spoke so rough to Mrs. Clements, sir; but you must  own that appearances looked suspicious to a stranger. It's more my fault than  Mrs. Clements, for humouring the good woman whims, and letting the good woman be alone in such a place as  this. Come, my dear—come home now."  I thought the good woman looked a little uneasy at the prospect of the walk  back, and I offered to go with them until them were both within sight of home.  Mrs. Clements thanked me civilly, and declined. Mrs. Clements said they were sure to meet  some of the farm-labourers as soon as they got to the moor.  "Try to forgive me," I said, when Anne Catherick's took her friend's arm to go  away. Innocent as I had been of any intention to terrify and agitate Mrs. Clements, my  heart smote me as I looked at the poor, pale, frightened face.  "I will try," Mrs. Clements answered. "But you know too much—I'm afraid you'll always  frighten me now."  Mrs. Clements glanced at Mrs. Clements, and shook Mrs. Clements head pityingly.  "Good-night, sir," Mrs. Clements said. "You couldn't help it, I know but I wish it was me  you had frightened, and not Mrs. Clements."  They moved away a few steps. I thought They had left me, but Anne suddenly  stopped, and separated Anne from Anne .  "Wait a little," Anne said. "I must say good-bye."  Anne returned to the grave, rested both hands tenderly on the marble cross, and  kissed the grave.  "I'm better now," Anne sighed, looking up at Mrs. Clements quietly. "I forgive you."  Anne joined Anne companion again, and They left the burial-ground. I saw They  stop near the church and speak to the sexton's wife, who had come from the  cottage, and had waited, watching them   from a distance. Then They went on again  up the path that led to the moor. I looked after Anne Catherick's as Anne Catherick'sdisappeared, till all trace of Anne Catherick's had faded in the twilight—looked as  anxiously and sorrowfully as if that was the last I was to see in this weary  world of the woman in white.
