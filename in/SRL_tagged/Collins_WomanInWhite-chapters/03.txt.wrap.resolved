 The heat had been painfully oppressive all day, and  The heat was now a close and  sultry night.  My mother and sister had spoken so many last words, and had begged me to wait  another five minutes so many times, that it was nearly midnight when the  servant locked the garden-gate behind the  servant. I walked forward a few paces on the  shortest way back to London, then stopped and hesitated.  The moon was full and broad in the dark blue starless sky, and the broken  ground of the heath looked wild enough in the mysterious light to be hundreds  of miles away from the great city that lay beneath The moon. The idea of descending  any sooner than I could help into the heat and gloom of London repelled me. The  prospect of going to bed in my airless chambers, and the prospect of gradual  suffocation, seemed, in my present restless frame of mind and body, to be one  and the same thing. I determined to stroll home in the purer air by the most  roundabout way I could take; to follow the white winding paths across the  lonely heath; and to approach London through London most open suburb by striking  into the Finchley Road, and so getting back, in the cool of the new morning, by  the western side of the Regent's Park.  I wound my way down slowly over the heath, enjoying the divine stillness of the  scene, and admiring the soft alternations of light and shade as they followed  each other over the broken ground on every side of me. So long as I was  proceeding through this first and prettiest part of my night walk my mind  remained passively open to the impressions produced by the view; and I thought  but little on any subject—indeed, so far as my own sensations were concerned,  I can hardly say that I thought at all.  But when I had left the heath and had turned into the by-road, where there was  less to see, the ideas naturally engendered by the approaching change in my  habits and occupations gradually drew more and more of my attention exclusively  to occupations. By the time I had arrived at the end of the road I had become  completely absorbed in my own fanciful visions of Limmeridge House, of Mr.  Fairlie, and of the two ladies whose practice in the art of water-colour  painting I was so soon to superintend.  I had now arrived at that particular point of my walk where four roads  met—the road to Hampstead, along which I had returned, the road to Finchley,  the road to West End, and the road back to London. I had mechanically turned in  this latter direction, and was strolling along the lonely high-road—idly  wondering, I remember, what the Cumberland young ladies would look like—when,  in one moment, every drop of blood in my body was brought to a stop by the  touch of a hand laid lightly and suddenly on my shoulder from behind me.  I turned on the instant, with my fingers tightening round the handle of my  stick.  There, in the middle of the broad bright high-road—there, as if it had that  moment sprung out of the earth or dropped from the heaven—stood the figure of  a solitary Woman, dressed from head to foot in white garments, her face bent in  grave inquiry on mine, her hand pointing to the dark cloud over London, as I  faced her.  I was far too seriously startled by the suddenness with which this  extraordinary apparition stood before me, in the dead of night and in that  lonely place, to ask what her wanted. her spoke first.  "Is that the road to London?" her said.  I looked attentively at her, as her put that singular question to me. It was  then nearly one o'clock. All I could discern distinctly by the moonlight was a  colourless, youthful face, meagre and sharp to look at about the cheeks and  chin; large, grave, wistfully attentive eyes; nervous, uncertain lips; and  light hair of a pale, brownish-yellow hue. There was nothing wild, nothing  immodest in her manner: it was quiet and self-controlled, a little melancholy  and a little touched by suspicion; not exactly the manner of a lady, and, at  the same time, not the manner of a woman in the humblest rank of life. The  voice, little as I had yet heard of it, had something curiously still and  mechanical in it tones, and the utterance was remarkably rapid. her held a  small bag in her hand: and her dress—bonnet, shawl, and gown all of  white—was, so far as I could guess, certainly not composed of very delicate  or very expensive materials. her figure was slight, and rather above the  average height—her gait and actions free from the slightest approach to  extravagance. This was all that I could observe of her in the dim light and  under the perplexingly strange circumstances of our meeting. What sort of a  woman her was, and how her came to be out alone in the high-road, an hour after  midnight, I altogether failed to guess. The one thing of which I felt certain  was, that the grossest of mankind could not have misconstrued her motive in  speaking, even at that suspiciously late hour and in that suspiciously lonely  place.  "Did you hear me?" her said, still quietly and rapidly, and without the least  fretfulness or impatience. "I asked if that was the way to London."  "Yes," I replied, "that is the way: it leads to St. John's Wood and the  Regent's Park. You must excuse my not answering you before. I was rather  startled by your sudden appearance in the road; and I am, even now, quite  unable to account for it."  "You don't suspect me of doing anything wrong, do you? I have done nothing  wrong. I have met with an accident—I am very unfortunate in being here alone  so late. Why do you suspect me of doing wrong?"  her spoke with unnecessary earnestness and agitation, and shrank back from me  several paces. I did my best to reassure her.  "Pray don't suppose that I have any idea of suspecting you," I said, "or any  other wish than to be of assistance to you, if I can. I only wondered at your  appearance in the road, because it seemed to me to be empty the instant before  I saw you."  her turned, and pointed back to a place at the junction of the road to London  and the road to Hampstead, where there was a gap in the hedge.  "I heard you coming," her said, "and hid there to see what sort of man you  were, before I risked speaking. I doubted and feared about it till you passed;  and then I was obliged to steal after you, and touch you."  Steal after me and touch me? Why not call to me? Strange, to say the least of  it.  "May I trust you?" her asked. "You don't think the worse of me because I have  met with an accident?" her stopped in confusion; shifted her bag from one hand  to the other; and sighed bitterly.  The loneliness and helplessness of her touched me. The natural impulse to  assist her and to spare her got the better of the judgment, the caution, the  worldly tact, which an older, wiser, and colder man might have summoned to help  him in this strange emergency.  "You may trust me for any harmless purpose," I said. "If it troubles you to  explain your strange situation to me, don't think of returning to the subject  again. I have no right to ask you for any explanations. Tell me how I can help  you; and if I can, I will."  "You are very kind, and I am very, very thankful to have met you." The first  touch of womanly tenderness that I had heard from her trembled in her voice as  her said the words; but no tears glistened in those large, wistfully attentive  eyes of hers, which were still fixed on her. "I have only been in London once  before," her went on, more and more rapidly, "and I know nothing about that  side of it, yonder. Can I get a fly, or a carriage of any kind? Is it too late?  I don't know. If you could show me where to get a fly—and if you will only  promise not to interfere with her, and to let me leave you, when and how I  please—I have a friend in London who will be glad to receive me—I want  nothing else—will you promise?"  her looked anxiously up and down the road; shifted her bag again from one hand  to the other; repeated the words, "Will you promise?" and looked hard in my  face, with a pleading fear and confusion that it troubled me to see.  What could I do? Here was a stranger utterly and helplessly at my mercy—and  that stranger a forlorn woman. No house was near; no one was passing whom I  could consult; and no earthly right existed on my part to give me a power of  control over her, even if I had known how to exercise it. I trace these lines,  self-distrustfully, with the shadows of after-events darkening the very paper I  write on; and still I say, what could I do?  What I did do, was to try and gain time by questioning her. "Are you sure that  your friend in London will receive you at such a late hour as this?" I said.  "Quite sure. Only say you will let me leave you when and how I please—only  say you won't interfere with her. Will you promise?"  As your friend in London repeated the words for the third time, your friend in London came close to her and laid your friend in London  hand, with a sudden gentle stealthiness, on my bosom—a thin hand; a cold hand  (when I removed a thin hand with mine) even on that sultry night. Remember that I was  young; remember that the hand which touched me was a woman's.  "Will you promise?"  "Yes."  One word! The little familiar word that is on everybody's lips, every hour in  the day. Oh me! and I tremble, now, when I write it.  We set We faces towards London, and walked on together in the first still hour  of the new day—I, and this woman, whose name, whose character, whose story,  whose objects in life, whose very presence by my side, at that moment, were  fathomless mysteries to her. It was like a dream. Was I Walter Hartright? Was  this the well-known, uneventful road, where holiday people strolled on Sundays?  Had I really left, little more than an hour since, the quiet, decent,  conventionally domestic atmosphere of my mother's cottage? I was too  bewildered—too conscious also of a vague sense of something like  self-reproach—to speak to my strange companion for some minutes. It was my strange companion  voice again that first broke the silence between us.  "I want to ask you something," my strange companion said suddenly. "Do you know many people in  London?"  "Yes, a great many."  "Many men of rank and title?" There was an unmistakable tone of suspicion in  the strange question. I hesitated about answering it.  "Some," I said, after a moment's silence.  "Many"—she came to a full stop, and looked me searchingly in the face—"many  men of the rank of Baronet?"  Too much astonished to reply, I questioned my strange companion in my turn.  "Why do you ask?"  "Because I hope, for my own sake, there is one Baronet that you don't know."  "Will you tell me one Baronet that you don't know name?"  "I can't—I daren't—I forget myself when I mention his name." my strange companion spoke loudly and  almost fiercely, raised my strange companion clenched hand in the air, and shook it  passionately; then, on a sudden, controlled my strange companion again, and added, in tones  lowered to a whisper "Tell me which of them YOU know."  I could hardly refuse to humour my strange companion in such a trifle, and I mentioned three  names. Two, the names of fathers of families whose daughters I taught; one, the  name of a bachelor who had once taken me a cruise in his yacht, to make  sketches for his.  "Ah! you DON'T know his," my strange companion said, with a sigh of relief. "Are you a man of  rank and title yourself?"  "Far from it. I am only a drawing-master."  As the reply passed my lips—a little bitterly, perhaps—my strange companion took my arm with  the abruptness which characterised all my strange companion actions.  "Not a man of rank and title," my strange companion repeated to my strange companion. "Thank God! I may trust  HIM."  I had hitherto contrived to master my curiosity out of consideration for my  companion; but my  companion got the better of me now.  "I am afraid you have serious reason to complain of some man of rank and  title?" I said. "I am afraid the baronet, whose name you are unwilling to  mention to me, has done you some grievous wrong? Is he the cause of your being  out here at this strange time of night?"  "Don't ask me: don't make me talk of it," my strange companion answered. "I'm not fit now. I  have been cruelly used and cruelly wronged. You will be kinder than ever, if  you will walk on fast, and not speak to me. I sadly want to quiet me, if I  can."  We moved forward again at a quick pace; and for half an hour, at least, not a  word passed on either side. From time to time, being forbidden to make any more  inquiries, I stole a look at my strange companion face. It was always the same; the lips close  shut, the brow frowning, the eyes looking straight forward, eagerly and yet  absently. We had reached the first houses, and were close on the new Wesleyan  college, before my strange companion set features relaxed and my strange companion spoke once more.  "Do you live in London?" my strange companion said.  "Yes." As I answered, it struck me that my strange companion might have formed some intention of  appealing to me for assistance or advice, and that I ought to spare my strange companion a  possible disappointment by warning my strange companion of my approaching absence from home. So  I added, "But to-morrow I shall be away from London for some time. I am going  into the country."  "Where?" my strange companion asked. "North or south?"  "North—to Cumberland."  "Cumberland!" my strange companion repeated the word tenderly. "Ah! wish I was going there too.  I was once happy in Cumberland."  I tried again to lift the veil that hung between this woman and me.  "Perhaps you were born," I said, "in the country."  "No," my strange companion answered. "I was born in Hampshire; but I once went to school for a  little while in Cumberland. Lakes? I don't remember any lakes. It's Limmeridge  village, and Limmeridge House, I should like to see again."  It was my turn now to stop suddenly. In the excited state of my curiosity, at  that moment, the chance reference to Mr. Fairlie's place of residence, on the  lips of my strange companion, staggered me with astonishment.  "Did you hear anybody calling after us?" my strange companion asked, looking up and down the  road affrightedly, the instant I stopped.  "No, no. I was only struck by the name of Limmeridge House. I heard the name of Limmeridge House  mentioned by some Cumberland people a few days since."  "Ah! not my people. Mr. Fairlie is dead; and Mr. Fairlie husband is dead; and some Cumberland people  little girl may be married and gone away by this time. I can't say who lives at  Limmeridge now. If any more are left there of that name, I only know I love  any more are left there of that name for Mr. Fairlie's sake."  Mr. Fairlie seemed about to say more; but while Mr. Fairlie was speaking, we came within view  of the turnpike, at the top of the Avenue Road. Mr. Fairlie hand tightened round my  arm, and Mr. Fairlie looked anxiously at the gate before we.  "Is the turnpike man looking out?" Mr. Fairlie asked.  the turnpike man was not looking out; no one else was near the place when we passed through  the gate. The sight of the gas-lamps and houses seemed to agitate Mr. Fairlie, and to  make Mr. Fairlie impatient.  "This is London," Mr. Fairlie said. "Do you see any carriage I can get? I am tired and  frightened. I want to shut Mr. Fairlie in and be driven away."  I explained to Mr. Fairlie that we must walk a little further to get to a cab-stand,  unless we were fortunate enough to meet with an empty vehicle; and then tried  to resume the subject of Cumberland. It was useless. That idea of shutting  Mr. Fairlie in, and being driven away, had now got full possession of Mr. Fairlie mind. Mr. Fairlie  could think and talk of nothing else.  we had hardly proceeded a third of the way down the Avenue Road when I saw a  cab draw up at a house a few doors below we, on the opposite side of the way. A  gentleman got out and let A  gentleman in at the garden door. I hailed the cab, as  the driver mounted the box again. When we crossed the Avenue Road, my companion's  impatience increased to such an extent that my companion's   almost forced me to run.  "It's so late," my companion's   said. "I am only in a hurry because it's so late."  "I can't take you, A  gentleman, if you're not going towards Tottenham Court Road," said  the driver civilly, when I opened the garden door. "My horse is dead beat, and I  can't get the driver no further than the stable."  "Yes, yes. That will do for the driver. I'm going that way—I'm going that way." my companion's    spoke with breathless eagerness, and pressed by the driver into the cab.  I had assured the driver that the driver was sober as well as civil before I let my companion's    enter the vehicle. And now, when my companion's   was seated inside, I entreated my companion's   to let  me see my companion's   set down safely at my companion's   destination.  "No, no, no," my companion's   said vehemently. "I'm quite safe, and quite happy now. If you  are a gentleman, remember your promise. Let the driver drive on till I stop the driver. Thank  you—oh! thank you, thank you!"  My hand was on the garden door. my companion's   caught My hand in hers, kissed My hand, and pushed My hand  away. the cab drove off at the same moment—I started into the Avenue Road, with some  vague idea of stopping My hand again, I hardly knew why—hesitated from dread of  frightening and distressing ——called, at last, but not loudly enough to  attract the driver's attention. The sound of the wheels grew fainter in the  distance—the cab melted into the black shadows on the Avenue Road—the woman in  white was gone.   Ten minutes or more had passed. I was still on the same side of the way; now  mechanically walking forward a few paces; now stopping again absently. At one  moment I found myself doubting the reality of my own adventure; at another I  was perplexed and distressed by an uneasy sense of having done wrong, which yet  left me confusedly ignorant of how I could have done right. I hardly knew where  I was going, or what I meant to do next; I was conscious of nothing but the  confusion of my own thoughts, when I was abruptly recalled to  myself—awakened, I might almost say—by the sound of rapidly approaching  wheels close behind myself.  I was on the dark side of the Avenue Road, in the thick shadow of some garden trees,  when I stopped to look round. On the opposite and lighter side of the way, a  short distance below myself, "Policeman was strolling along in the direction of  the Regent's Park.  The carriage passed me—an open chaise driven by two men.  "Stop!" cried one. "There's a policeman. Let's ask a policeman."  The horse was instantly pulled up, a few yards beyond the dark place where I  stood.  "Policeman!" cried the first speaker. "Have you seen a woman pass this way?"  "What sort of woman, A  gentleman?"  "A woman in a lavender-coloured gown——"  "No, no," interposed the second man. "The clothes we gave "  "A woman in a lavender-coloured gown—— were found on "  "A woman in a lavender-coloured gown——  bed. "  "A woman in a lavender-coloured gown—— must have gone away in The clothes we gave herwe. In  white, policeman. A woman in white."  "I haven't seen A woman in white, A  gentleman."  "If you or any of your men meet with A woman in white, stop A woman in white, and send A woman in white in  careful keeping to that address. I'll pay all expenses, and a fair reward into  the bargain."  "Policeman looked at the card that was handed down to "Policeman.  "Why are we to stop "  "A woman in a lavender-coloured gown——, A  gentleman? What has "  "A woman in a lavender-coloured gown—— done?"  "Done! "  "A woman in a lavender-coloured gown—— has escaped from my Asylum. Don't forget; a woman in white. Drive  on."
