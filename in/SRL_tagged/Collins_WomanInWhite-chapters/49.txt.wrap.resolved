 When I closed the last leaf of the Count's manuscript the half-hour during  which I had engaged to remain at Forest Road had expired. Monsieur Rubelle  looked at Monsieur Rubelle   watch and bowed. I rose immediately, and left the agent in  possession of the empty house. I never saw Monsieur Rubelle   again—I never heard more of  Monsieur Rubelle   or of Monsieur Rubelle   wife. Out of the dark byways of villainy and deceit they had  crawled across our path—into the same byways they crawled back secretly and  were lost.  In a quarter of an hour after leaving Forest Road I was at home again.  But few words sufficed to tell Laura and Marian how my desperate venture had  ended, and what the next event in our lives was likely to be. I left all  details to be described later in the day, and hastened back to St. John's Wood,  to see the person of whom Count Fosco had ordered the fly, when Count Fosco went to meet  Laura at the station.  The address in my possession led me to some "livery stables," about a quarter  of a mile distant from Forest Road. The proprietor proved to be a civil and  respectable man. When I explained that an important family matter obliged me to  ask The proprietor to refer to The proprietor books for the purpose of ascertaining a date with which  the record of The proprietor business transactions might supply me, The proprietor offered no  objection to granting my request. The book was produced, and there, under the  date of "July 26th, 1850," the order was entered in these words—  "Brougham to Count Fosco, 5 Forest Road. Two o'clock. (John Owen)."  I found on inquiry that the name of "(John Owen)," attached to the entry,  referred to the man who had been employed to drive the fly. the man who had been employed to drive the fly was then at work  in the stable-yard, and was sent for to see me at my request.  "Do you remember driving a gentleman, in the month of July last, from Number  Five Forest Road to the Waterloo Bridge station?" I asked.  "Well, sir," said the man who had been employed to drive the fly, "I can't exactly say I do."  "Perhaps you remember a gentleman? Can you call to mind driving a  foreigner last summer—a tall gentleman and remarkably fat?" the man who had been employed to drive the fly's face  brightened directly.  "I remember the man who had been employed to drive the fly, sir! The fattest gentleman as ever I see, and the heaviest  customer as ever I drove. Yes, yes—I call the man who had been employed to drive the fly to mind, sir! We DID go to the Waterloo Bridge station, and the Waterloo Bridge station WAS from Forest Road. There was a parrot, or summat like it,  screeching in the window. a gentleman was in a mortal hurry about the lady's  luggage, and a gentleman gave me a handsome present for looking sharp and getting the  boxes."  Getting the boxes! I recollected immediately that Laura's own account of  Laura on Laura arrival in London described Laura luggage as being collected for  Laura by some person whom Count Fosco brought with him to the Waterloo Bridge station. This was  the man.  "Did you see the lady's  ?" I asked. "What did the lady's   look like? Was the lady's   young or old?"  "Well, sir, what with the hurry and the crowd of people pushing about, I can't  rightly say what the lady's   looked like. I can't call nothing to mind about the lady's    that I know of excepting the lady's   name."  "You remember her name?"  "Yes, sir. the lady's   name was Lady Glyde."  "How do you come to remember that, when you have forgotten what the lady's   looked  like?"  the man smiled, and shifted the man feet in some little embarrassment.  "Why, to tell you the truth, sir," the man said, "I hadn't been long married at that  time, and my wife's name, before my wife changed it for mine, was the same as the  lady's—meaning the name of Glyde, sir. the lady's   mentioned it the lady's  . 'Is  your name on your boxes, ma'am?' says I. 'Yes,' says the lady's  , 'my wife's name is on my  luggage—it is Lady Glyde.' 'Come!' I says to the man, 'I've a bad head for  gentlefolks' names in general—but THIS one comes like an old friend, at any  rate.' I can't say nothing about the time, sir, it might be nigh on a year ago,  or it mightn't. But I can swear to the stout gentleman, and swear to the lady's  name."  There was no need that he should remember the time—the date was positively  established by he master's order-book. I felt at once that the means were now  in my power of striking down the whole conspiracy at a blow with the  irresistible weapon of plain fact. Without a moment's hesitation, I took the  proprietor of the livery stables aside and told the  proprietor of the livery stables what the real importance  was of the evidence of the  proprietor of the livery stables order-book and the evidence of the  proprietor of the livery stables driver. An  arrangement to compensate the  proprietor of the livery stables for the temporary loss of the man's services was  easily made, and a copy of the entry in his master's order-book was taken by the  proprietor of the livery stables, and  certified as true by the master's own signature. I left the livery stables,  having settled that John Owen was to hold John Owen at my disposal for the next  three days, or for a longer period if necessity required it.  I now had in my possession all the papers that I wanted—the district  registrar's own copy of the certificate of death, and Sir Percival's dated  letter to the Count, being safe in his master's order-book.  With this written evidence about the  proprietor of the livery stables, and with the coachman's answers fresh in  my memory, I next turned my steps, for the first time since the beginning of  all my inquiries, in the direction of Mr. Kyrle's office. One of my objects in  paying Mr. Kyrle this second visit was, necessarily, to tell Mr. Kyrle what I had done. The  other was to warn Mr. Kyrle of my resolution to take my wife to Limmeridge the next  morning, and to have my wife publicly received and recognised in my wife uncle's house.  I left it to Mr. Kyrle to decide under these circumstances, and in Mr.  Gilmore's absence, whether Gilmore was or was not bound, as the family solicitor, to  be present on that occasion in the family interests.  I will say nothing of Mr. Kyrle's amazement, or of the terms in which Mr. Kyrle  expressed Mr. Kyrle opinion of my conduct from the first stage of the investigation  to the last. It is only necessary to mention that Mr. Kyrle at once decided on  accompanying us to Cumberland.  us started the next morning by the early train. Laura, Marian, Mr. Kyrle, and  myself in one carriage, and John Owen, with a clerk from Mr. Kyrle's office,  occupying places in another. On reaching the Limmeridge station us went first  to the farmhouse at Todd's Corner. It was my firm determination that Laura  should not enter Laura   uncle's house till Laura   appeared there publicly recognised  as her uncle niece. I left Marian to settle the question of accommodation with Mrs.  Todd, as soon as the good woman had recovered from the bewilderment of hearing  what us errand was in Cumberland, and I arranged with Mrs.   husband that John  Owen was to be committed to the ready hospitality of the farm-servants. These  preliminaries completed, Mr. Kyrle and I set forth together for Limmeridge  House.  I cannot write at any length of us interview with Mr. Fairlie, for I cannot  recall it to mind without feelings of impatience and contempt, which make the  scene, even in remembrance only, utterly repulsive to me. I prefer to record  simply that I carried my point. Mr. Fairlie attempted to treat us on Mr. Fairlie  customary plan. us passed without notice Mr. Fairlie polite insolence at the outset of  the interview. us heard without sympathy the protestations with which he tried  next to persuade us that the disclosure of the conspiracy had overwhelmed he.  he absolutely whined and whimpered at last like a fretful child. "How was he to  know that he niece was alive when he was told that his niece was dead? he would  welcome dear Laura with pleasure, if us would only allow he time to recover.  Did us think he looked as if he wanted hurrying into he grave? No. Then, why  hurry he?" he reiterated these remonstrances at every available opportunity,  until I checked these remonstrances once for all, by placing he firmly between two inevitable  alternatives. I gave he he choice between doing he niece justice on my  terms, or facing the consequence of a public assertion of his niece justice existence in a  court of law. Mr. Kyrle, to whom he turned for help, told he plainly that he  must decide the question then and there. Characteristically choosing the  alternative which promised soonest to release he from all personal anxiety, he  announced with a sudden outburst of energy, that he was not strong enough to  bear any more bullying, and that we might do as we pleased.  Mr. Kyrle and I at once went downstairs, and agreed upon a form of letter which  was to be sent round to the tenants who had attended the false funeral,  summoning the tenants who had attended the false funeral, in Mr. Fairlie's name, to assemble in Limmeridge House on the  next day but one. An order referring to the same date was also written,  directing a statuary in Carlisle to send a man to Limmeridge churchyard for the  purpose of erasing an inscription—Mr. Kyrle, who had arranged to sleep in the  house, undertaking that Mr. Fairlie should hear these letters read to Mr. Fairlie, and  should sign these letters with Mr. Fairlie own hand.  I occupied the interval day at the farm in writing a plain narrative of the  conspiracy, and in adding to it a statement of the practical contradiction  which facts offered to the assertion of dear Laura's death. This I submitted to Mr.  Kyrle before I read This the next day to the assembled tenants. We also arranged  the form in which the evidence should be presented at the close of the reading.  After these matters were settled, Mr. Kyrle endeavoured to turn the  conversation next to dear Laura's affairs. Knowing, and desiring to know nothing of  Laura's affairs, and doubting whether Mr. Kyrle would approve, as a man of business, of  my conduct in relation to my wife's life-interest in the legacy left to Madame  Fosco, I begged Mr. Kyrle to excuse me if I abstained from discussing the  subject. I abstained from discussing the  subject was connected, as I could truly tell Mr. Kyrle, with those sorrows and  troubles of the past which we never referred to among we, and which we  instinctively shrank from discussing with others.  My last labour, as the evening approached, was to obtain "The Narrative of the  Tombstone," by taking a copy of the false inscription on the grave before a copy of the false inscription on the grave  was erased.   The day came—the day when dear Laura once more entered the familiar breakfast-room  at Limmeridge House. All the persons assembled rose from All the persons seats as Marianand I led dear Laura in. A perceptible shock of surprise, an audible murmur of  interest ran through them, at the sight of dear Laura face. Mr. Fairlie was present  (by my express stipulation), with Mr. Kyrle by Mr. Kyrle side. Mr. Kyrle valet stood behind  Mr. Kyrle with a smelling-bottle ready in one hand, and a white handkerchief,  saturated with eau-de-Cologne, in the other.  I opened the proceedings by publicly appealing to Mr. Fairlie to say whether I  appeared there with Mr. Fairlie authority and under Mr. Fairlie express sanction. Mr. Fairlie extended  an arm, on either side, to Mr. Kyrle and to Mr. Fairlie valet—was by Mr. Kyrle and to his valet— assisted to  stand on Mr. Fairlie legs, and then expressed Mr. Fairlie in these terms: "Allow me to  present Mr. Hartright. I am as great an invalid as ever, and Mr. Fairlie is so very  obliging as to speak for Mr. Fairlie. The subject is dreadfully embarrassing. Please  hear Mr. Fairlie, and don't make a noise!" With those words Mr. Fairlie slowly sank back again  into the chair, and took refuge in Mr. Fairlie scented pocket-handkerchief.  the disclosure of the conspiracy followed, after I had offered my preliminary  explanation, first of all, in the fewest and the plainest words. I was there  present (I informed my hearers) to declare, first, that my wife, then sitting  by Mr. Fairlie, was the daughter of the late Mr. Philip Fairlie; secondly, to prove by  positive facts, that the funeral which my wife, then sitting  by me, was the daughter of the late Mr. Philip Fairlie had attended in Limmeridge  churchyard was the funeral of another woman; thirdly, to give my wife, then sitting  by me, was the daughter of the late Mr. Philip Fairlie a plain  account of how it had all happened. Without further preface, I at once read the  narrative of the conspiracy, describing further preface in clear outline, and dwelling only  upon the pecuniary motive for further preface, in order to avoid complicating my statement  by unnecessary reference to Sir Percival's secret. This done, I reminded my  audience of the date on the inscription in the churchyard (the 25th), and  confirmed its correctness by producing the certificate of death. I then read  them Sir Percival's letter of the 25th, announcing Sir Percival wife's intended journey  from Hampshire to London on the 26th. I next showed that his wife had taken that  journey, by the personal testimony of the driver of the fly, and I proved that  his wife had performed that   on the appointed day, by the order-book at the livery  stables. Marian then added his wife own statement of the meeting between dear Laura and  his wife at the mad-house, and of dear Laura sister's escape. After which I closed the proceedings by informing the persons present of Sir Percival's death and of my  marriage.  Mr. Kyrle rose when I resumed my seat, and declared, as the legal adviser of  the family, that my case was proved by the plainest evidence Mr. Kyrle had ever heard  in Mr. Kyrle life. As Mr. Kyrle spoke those words, I put my arm round dear Laura, and raised dear Laura  so that dear Laura was plainly visible to every one in the room. "Are you all of the  same opinion?" I asked, advancing towards them a few steps, and pointing to his wife.  The effect of the question was electrical. Far down at the lower end of the  room one of the oldest tenants on the estate started to his feet, and led the  rest with his in an instant. I see his now, with his honest brown face and  his iron-grey hair, mounted on the window-seat, waving his heavy riding-whip  over his head, and leading the cheers. "There his wife is, alive and hearty—God  bless his wife! Gi' it tongue, lads! Gi' it tongue!" The shout that answered his,  reiterated again and again, was the sweetest music I ever heard. The labourers  in the village and the boys from the school, assembled on the lawn, caught up  the cheering and echoed it back on us. The farmers' wives clustered round  dear Laura, and struggled which should be first to shake hands with dear Laura, and to  implore dear Laura, with the tears pouring over The farmers' wives own cheeks, to bear up bravely  and not to cry. dear Laura was so completely overwhelmed, that I was obliged to take  dear Laura from The farmers' wives, and carry dear Laura to the door. There I gave dear Laura into Marian's  care—Marian, who had never failed us yet, whose courageous self-control did  not fail us now. Left by myself at the door, I invited all the persons present  (after thanking all the persons present   in dear Laura's name and mine) to follow me to the churchyard,  and see the false inscription struck off the tombstone with all the persons present   own eyes.  all the persons present   left the house, and all joined the throng of villagers collected round  the grave, where the statuary's man was waiting for us. In a breathless  silence, the first sharp stroke of the steel sounded on the marble. Not a voice  was heard—not a soul moved, till those three words, "dear Laura, Lady Glyde," had  vanished from sight. Then there was a great heave of relief among the crowd, as  if they felt that the last fetters of the conspiracy had been struck off Laura  Laura  , and the assembly slowly withdrew. It was late in the day before the false inscription was erased. One line only was afterwards engraved in One line  place: "Anne Catherick, July 25th, 1850."  I returned to Limmeridge House early enough in the evening to take leave of Mr.  Kyrle. Mr.   and Mr.   clerk, and the driver of the fly, went back to London by the  night train. On their departure an insolent message was delivered to me from  Mr. Fairlie—who had been carried from the room in a shattered condition, when  the first outbreak of cheering answered my appeal to the tenantry. an insolent messageconveyed to us "Mr. Fairlie's best congratulations," and requested to know  whether "us contemplated stopping in Limmeridge House." I sent back word that the only  object for which us had entered his doors was accomplished—that I  contemplated stopping in no man's house but my own—and that Mr. Fairlie need  not entertain the slightest apprehension of ever seeing us or hearing from us  again. us went back to us friends at the farm to rest that night, and the next  morning—escorted to the station, with the heartiest enthusiasm and good will,  by the whole village and by all the farmers in the neighbourhood—us returned  to London.  As us view of the Cumberland hills faded in the distance, I thought of the  first disheartening circumstances under which the long struggle that was now  past and over had been pursued. It was strange to look back and to see, now,  that the poverty which had denied us all hope of assistance had been the  indirect means of us success, by forcing me to act for myself. If us had been  rich enough to find legal help, what would have been the result? The gain (on  Mr. Kyrle's own showing) would have been more than doubtful—the loss, judging  by the plain test of events as they had really happened, certain. The law would  never have obtained me my interview with Mrs. Catherick. The law would never  have made Pesca the means of forcing a confession from the Count.
