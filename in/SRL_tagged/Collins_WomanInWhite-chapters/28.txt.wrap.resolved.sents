 June 19th.—Once safely shut into my own room, I opened these pages, and  prepared to go on with that part of the day's record which was still left to  write.
For ten minutes or more I sat idle, with the pen in my hand, thinking over the  events of the last twelve hours.
When I at last addressed myself to my task, I  found a difficulty in proceeding with my task which I had never experienced before.
In spite of my efforts to fix my thoughts on the matter in hand, they wandered  away with the strangest persistency in the one direction of Sir Percival and  the Count, and all the interest which I tried to concentrate on my journal  centred instead in that private interview between they which had been put off  all through the day, and which was now to take place in the silence and  solitude of the night.
In this perverse state of my mind, the recollection of what had passed since  the morning would not come back to myself, and there was no resource but to close  my journal   and to get away from my journal   for a little while.
I opened the door which led from my bedroom into my sitting-room, and having  passed through, pulled the door which led from my bedroom into my sitting-room to again, to prevent any accident in case of draught  with the candle left on the dressing-table.
My sitting-room window was wide  open, and I leaned out listlessly to look at the night.
My sitting-room window was dark and quiet.
Neither moon nor stars were visible.
There was a smell  like rain in the still, heavy air, and I put my hand out of window.
No.
The  rain was only threatening, The  rain had not come yet.
I remained leaning on the window-sill for nearly a quarter of an hour, looking  out absently into the black darkness, and hearing nothing, except now and then  the voices of the servants, or the distant sound of a closing door, in the  lower part of the house.
Just as I was turning away wearily from the window to go back to the bedroom  and make a second attempt to complete the unfinished entry in my journal  , I  smelt the odour of tobacco-smoke stealing towards me on the heavy night air.
The next moment I saw a tiny red spark advancing from the farther end of the  house in the pitch darkness.
I heard no footsteps, and I could see nothing but  a tiny red spark advancing from the farther end of the  house in the pitch darkness.
no footsteps travelled along in the night, passed the window at which I was  standing, and stopped opposite my bedroom window, inside which I had left the  light burning on the dressing-table.
a tiny red spark advancing from the farther end of the  house in the pitch darkness remained stationary for a moment, then moved back again in the  direction from which a tiny red spark advancing from the farther end of the  house in the pitch darkness had advanced.
As I followed a tiny red spark advancing from the farther end of the  house in the pitch darkness progress I saw a second  red spark, larger than the first, approaching from the distance.
The two met  together in the darkness.
Remembering who smoked cigarettes and who smoked  cigars, I inferred immediately that the Count had come out first to look and  listen under my window, and that Sir Percival had afterwards joined Sir Percival.
the Count had come out first to look and  listen under my window, and that Sir Percival had afterwards joined him  must both have been walking on the lawn—or I should certainly have heard Sir  Percival's heavy footfall, though the Count's soft step might have escaped me,  even on the gravel walk.
I waited quietly at my window, certain that they could neither of they see me  in the darkness of the room.
"What's the matter?"
I heard Sir Percival say in a low voice.
"Why don't you  come in and sit down?"
"I want to see the light out of my window," replied the Count softly.
"What harm does the light do?"
"It shows she is not in bed yet.
she is sharp enough to suspect something, and  bold enough to come downstairs and listen, if she can get the chance.
Patience,  Percival—patience."
"Humbug!
You're always talking of patience."
"I shall talk of something else presently.
My good friend, you are on the edge  of your domestic precipice, and if I let you give the women one other chance,  on my sacred word of honour the women will push you over my sacred word of honour!"
"What the devil do you mean?"
"We will come to We explanations, Sir Percival, when the light is out of that  window, and when I have had one little look at the rooms on each side of the  library, and a peep at the staircase as well."
the women slowly moved away, and the rest of the conversation between the women (which  had been conducted throughout in the same low tones) ceased to be audible.
It  was no matter.
I had heard enough to determine me on justifying the Count's  opinion of my sharpness and my courage.
Before the red sparks were out of sight  in the darkness I had made up my mind that there should be a listener when  those two men sat down to those two men talk—and that the listener, in spite of all  the Count's precautions to the contrary, should be myself.
I wanted but one  motive to sanction the act to my own conscience, and to give me courage enough  for performing it—and that motive I had.
Laura's honour, Laura's  happiness—Laura's life itself—might depend on my quick ears and my faithful  memory to-night.
I had heard the Count say that the Count meant to examine the rooms on each side of  the library, and the staircase as well, before the Count entered on any explanation  with Sir Percival.
This expression of the Count intentions was necessarily sufficient  to inform me that the library was the room in which the Count proposed that the  conversation should take place.
The one moment of time which was long enough to  bring me to that conclusion was also the moment which showed me a means of  baffling the Count precautions—or, in other words, of hearing what the Count and Sir  Percival said to each other, without the risk of descending at all into the  lower regions of the house.
In speaking of the rooms on the ground floor I have mentioned incidentally the  verandah outside them, on which they all opened by means of French windows,  extending from the cornice to the ground floor.
The top of this verandah was flat, the  rain-water being carried off from the  rain-water by pipes into tanks which helped to supply  the house.
On the narrow leaden roof, which ran along past the bedrooms, and  which was rather less, I should think, than three feet below the sills of the  window, a row of flower-pots was ranged, with wide intervals between each  pot—the whole being protected from falling in high winds by an ornamental  iron railing along the edge of the roof.
The plan which had now occurred to me was to get out at my sitting-room window  on to the roof, to creep along noiselessly till I reached that part of the roof  which was immediately over the library window, and to crouch down between the  flower-pots, with my ear against the outer railing.
If Sir Percival and the  Count sat and smoked to-night, as I had seen Sir Percival and the  Count sitting and smoking many  nights before, with Sir Percival and the  Count chairs close at the open window, and Sir Percival and the  Count feet  stretched on the zinc garden seats which were placed under the verandah, every  word Sir Percival and the  Count said to each other above a whisper (and no long conversation, as Sir Percival and the  Count  all know by experience, can be carried on IN a whisper) must inevitably reach  my ears.
If, on the other hand, Sir Percival and the  Count chose to-night to sit far back inside the  room, then the chances were that I should hear little or nothing—and in that  case, I must run the far more serious risk of trying to outwit them downstairs.
Strongly as I was fortified in my resolution by the desperate nature of our  situation, I hoped most fervently that I might escape this last emergency.
My  courage was only a woman's courage after all, and it was very near to failing  me when I thought of trusting myself on the ground floor, at the dead of night,  within reach of Sir Percival and the Count.
I went softly back to my bedroom to try the safer experiment of the verandah  roof first.
A complete change in my dress was imperatively necessary for many reasons.
I  took off my silk gown to begin with, because the slightest noise from my silk on  that still night might have betrayed me.
I next removed the white and  cumbersome parts of my underclothing, and replaced parts of my underclothing by a petticoat of dark  flannel.
Over this I put my black travelling cloak, and pulled the hood on to  my head.
In my ordinary evening costume I took up the room of three men at  least.
In my dress, when it was held close about myself, no man could have  passed through the narrowest spaces more easily than I.
The little breadth left  on the roof of the verandah, between the flower-pots on one side and the wall  and the windows of the house on the other, made this a serious consideration.
If I knocked anything down, if I made the least noise, who could say what the  consequences might be?
I only waited to put the matches near the candle before I extinguished the candle, and  groped my way back into the sitting-room, I locked that door, as I had locked  my bedroom door—then quietly got out of the window, and cautiously set my  feet on the leaden roof of the verandah.
My two rooms were at the inner extremity of the new wing of the house in which  we all lived, and I had five windows to pass before I could reach the position  it was necessary to take up immediately over the library.
the windowbelonged to a spare room which was empty.
The second and third windows belonged  to Laura's room.
the window belonged to a spare room which was empty.
The fifth  belonged to a spare room which was empty.
The others, by which it was not necessary for  me to pass, were the windows of the Count's dressing-room, of the bathroom, and  of the second empty spare room.
No sound reached my ears—the black blinding darkness of the night was all  round me when I first stood on the verandah, except at that part of all   which  Madame Fosco's window overlooked.
There, at the very place above the library to  which my course was directed—there I saw a gleam of light!
the Countess was  not yet in bed.
It was too late to draw back—it was no time to wait.
I determined to go on at  all hazards, and trust for security to my own caution and to the darkness of  the night.
"For Laura's sake!"
I thought to myself, as I took the first step  forward on the roof, with one hand holding my cloak close round myself, and the  other groping against the wall of the house.
It was better to brush close by  the wall of the house than to risk striking my feet against the flower-pots within a few  inches of myself, on the other side.
I passed the dark window of the spare room, trying the roof at each step  with my foot before I risked resting my weight on the dark window of the spare room.
I passed the dark windows  of Laura's room ("God bless Laura and keep Laura to-night!").
I passed the dark window of the spare room.
Then I waited a moment, knelt down with my hands  to support me, and so crept to my position, under the protection of the low  wall between the bottom of the lighted window and the verandah roof.
When I ventured to look up at the dark window of the spare room I found that the top of the dark window of the spare room only  was open, and that the blind inside was drawn down.
While I was looking I saw  the shadow of Madame Fosco pass across the white field of the blind—then pass  slowly back again.
Thus far Madame Fosco could not have heard me, or the shadow of Madame Fosco would  surely have stopped at the blind, even if Madame Fosco had wanted courage enough to open  the dark window of the spare room and look out?
I placed myself sideways against the railing of the verandah—first  ascertaining, by touching them, the position of the flower-pots on either side  of myself.
There was room enough for me to sit between them and no more.
The  sweet-scented leaves of the flower on my left hand just brushed my cheek as I  lightly rested my head against the railing.
The first sounds that reached me from below were caused by the opening or  closing (most probably the latter) of three doors in succession—the doors, no  doubt, leading into the hall and into the rooms on each side of the library,  which the Count had pledged the Count to examine.
The first object that I saw was  the red spark again travelling out into the night from under the verandah,  moving away towards the dark window of the spare room, waiting a moment, and then returning to the  place from which it had set out.
"The devil take your restlessness!
When do you mean to sit down?"
growled Sir  Sir Percival's voice beneath Sir  .
"Ouf!
how hot it is!"
said the Count, sighing and puffing wearily.
the Count exclamation was followed by the scraping of the garden chairs on the tiled  pavement under the verandah—the welcome sound which told me they were going  to sit close at the window as usual.
So far the chance was mine.
The clock in  the turret struck the quarter to twelve as they settled they in they  chairs.
I heard Madame Fosco through the open window yawning, and saw Madame Foscoshadow pass once more across the white field of the blind.
Meanwhile, Sir Percival and the Count began talking together below, now and  then dropping Sir Percival and the Count voices a little lower than usual, but never sinking their voices to  a whisper.
The strangeness and peril of my situation, the dread, which I could  not master, of Madame Fosco lighted window, made it difficult, almost  impossible, for me, at first, to keep my presence of mind, and to fix my  attention solely on the conversation beneath.
For some minutes I could only  succeed in gathering the general substance of it.
I understood the Count to say  that the one window alight was the Count wife's, that the ground floor of the house  was quite clear, and that the Count might now speak to each other without fear of  accidents.
Sir Percival merely answered by upbraiding Sir Percival friend with having  unjustifiably slighted Sir Percival wishes and neglected Sir Percival interests all through the  day.
the Count thereupon defended the Count by declaring that the Count had been beset  by certain troubles and anxieties which had absorbed all the Count attention, and  that the only safe time to come to an explanation was a time when they could  feel certain of being neither interrupted nor overheard.
"We are at a serious  crisis in We affairs, Sir Percival," the Count said, "and if We are to decide on the  future at all, We must decide secretly to-night."
That sentence of the Count's was the first which my attention was ready enough  to master exactly as it was spoken.
From this point, with certain breaks and  interruptions, my whole interest fixed breathlessly on the conversation, and I  followed it word for word.
"Crisis?"
repeated Sir Percival.
"It's a worse crisis than you think for, I can  tell you."
"So I should suppose, from your behaviour for the last day or two," returned  the other coolly.
"But wait a little.
Before We advance to what I do NOT know,  let We be quite certain of what I DO know.
Let We first see if I am right about  the time that is past, before I make any proposal to you for the time that is  to come."
"Stop till I get the brandy and water.
Have some you."
"Thank you, Sir Percival.
The cold water with pleasure, a spoon, and the basin of  sugar.
Eau sucree, my friend—nothing more."
"Sugar-and-water for a man of your age!—There!
mix your sickly mess.
You  foreigners are all alike."
"Now listen, Sir Percival.
I will put We position plainly before you, as I  understand our position, and you shall say if I am right or wrong.
You and I both came  back to this house from the Continent with We affairs very seriously  embarrassed—"  "Cut it short!
I wanted some thousands and you some hundreds, and without the  money We were some thousands and you some hundreds in a fair way to go to the dogs together.
There's the  situation.
Make what you can of the  situation.
Go on."
"Well, Sir Percival, in your own solid English words, you wanted some thousands and  I wanted some hundreds, and the only way of getting some hundreds was for you to raise  the money for your own necessity (with a small margin beyond for my poor little  hundreds) by the help of your wife.
What did I tell you about your wife on We  way to England?—and what did I tell you again when We had come here, and when  I had seen for myself the sort of woman Miss Halcombe was?"
"How should I know?
You talked nineteen to the dozen, I suppose, just as usual."
"I said this: Human ingenuity, my friend, has hitherto only discovered two ways  in which a man can manage a woman.
One way is to knock a woman down—a method  largely adopted by the brutal lower orders of the people, but utterly abhorrent  to the refined and educated classes above the people.
The other way (much longer,  much more difficult, but in the end not less certain) is never to accept a  provocation at a woman's hands.
It holds with animals, It holds with children,  and It holds with women, who are nothing but children grown up.
Quiet  resolution is the one quality the animals, the children, and the women all fail  in.
If the children, and the women all can once shake this superior quality in the children, and the women all master, the children, and the women all get the  better of HIM.
If the children, and the women all can never succeed in disturbing it, HIM gets the better  of THEM.
I said to you, Remember that plain truth when you want your wife to  help you to the money.
I said, Remember it doubly and trebly in the presence of  your wife's sister, Miss Halcombe.
Have you remembered it?
Not once in all the  implications that have twisted themselves about us in this house.
Every  provocation that your wife and your wife sister could offer to you, you instantly  accepted from themselves.
Your mad temper lost the signature to the deed, lost the  ready money, set Miss Halcombe writing to the lawyer for the first time."
"First time!
Has Miss Halcombe written again?"
"Yes, Miss Halcombe has written again to-day."
A chair fell on the pavement of the verandah—fell with a crash, as if A chair had  been kicked down.
It was well for me that the Count's revelation roused Sir Percival's anger as  the Count's revelation did.
On hearing that I had been once more discovered I started so that the  railing against which I leaned cracked again.
Had Sir Percival followed me to the inn?
Did Sir Percival infer that I must have given my letters to Fanny when I told Sir Percival I had  none for the post-bag.
Even if it was so, how could Sir Percival have examined my letters when my letters had gone straight from my hand to the bosom of the girl's  dress?
"Thank your lucky star," I heard the Count say next, "that you have me in this house to undo the harm as fast as you do the harm.
Thank your lucky star that I said  No when you were mad enough to talk of turning the key to-day on Miss Halcombe,  as you turned it in your mischievous folly on your wife.
Where are your eyes?
Can you look at Miss Halcombe and not see that Miss Halcombe has the foresight and the  resolution of a man?
With that woman for my friend I would snap these fingers  of mine at the world.
With that woman for my enemy, I, with all my brains and  experience—I, Fosco, cunning as the devil himself, as you have told me a  hundred times—I walk, in your English phrase, upon egg-shells!
And this grand  creature—I drink my friend health in my sugar-and-water—this grand creature, who  stands in the strength of my friend love and my friend courage, firm as a rock, between us  two and that poor, flimsy, pretty blonde wife of yours—this magnificent  woman, whom I admire with all my soul, though I oppose my friend in your interests  and in mine, you drive to extremities as if my friend was no sharper and no bolder  than the rest of my friend sex.
Sir Percival!
Sir Percival!
you deserve to fail, and you HAVE  failed."
There was a pause.
I write the villain's words about myself because I mean to  remember the villain's words about myself—because I hope yet for the day when I may speak out once for  all in his presence, and cast the villain's words about myself back one by one in his teeth.
Sir Percival was the first to break the silence again.
"Yes, yes, bully and bluster as much as you like," Sir Percival said sulkily; "the  difficulty about the money is not the only difficulty.
You would be for taking  strong measures with the women yourself—if you knew as much as I do."
"We will come to that second difficulty all in good time," rejoined the Count.
"You may confuse yourself, Sir Percival, as much as you please, but you shall not  confuse me.
Let the question of the money be settled first.
Have I convinced  your obstinacy?
have I shown you that your temper will not let you help  yourself?—Or must I go back, and (as you put it in your dear straightforward  English) bully and bluster a little more?"
"Pooh!
It's easy enough to grumble at ME.
Say what is to be done—that's a  little harder."
"Is it?
Bah!
This is what is to be done: You give up all direction in the  business from to-night—you leave it for the future in my hands only.
I am  talking to a Practical British man—ha?
Well, Practical, will that do for you?"
"What do you propose if I leave it all to you?"
"Answer me first.
Is it to be in my hands or not?"
"Say it is in your hands—what then?"
"A few questions, Sir Percival, to begin with.
I must wait a little yet, to let  circumstances guide me, and I must know, in every possible way, what those  circumstances are likely to be.
There is no time to lose.
I have told you  already that Miss Halcombe has written to the lawyer to-day for the second  time."
"How did you find it out?
What did Miss Halcombe say?"
"If I told you, Sir Percival, we should only come back at the end to where we are  now.
Enough that I have found it out—and the finding has caused that trouble  and anxiety which made me so inaccessible to you all through to-day.
Now, to  refresh my memory about your affairs—it is some time since I talked them over  with you.
The money has been raised, in the absence of your wife's signature,  by means of bills at three months—raised at a cost that makes my  poverty-stricken foreign hair stand on end to think of my  poverty-stricken foreign hair!
When the bills are  due, is there really and truly no earthly way of paying the bills but by the help of  your wife?"
"None."
"What!
You have no money at the bankers?"
"A few hundreds, when I want as many thousands."
"Have you no other security to borrow upon?"
"Not a shred."
"What have you actually got with your wife at the present moment?"
"Nothing but the interest of your wife twenty thousand pounds—barely enough to pay  our daily expenses."
"What do you expect from your wife?"
"Three thousand a year when your wife uncle dies."
"A fine fortune, Sir Percival.
What sort of a man is her uncle?
Old?"
"No—neither old nor young."
"A good-tempered, freely-living man?
Married?
No—I think your wife told me, not  married."
"Of course not.
If her uncle was married, and had a son, Lady Glyde would not be next  heir to the property.
I'll tell you what her uncle is.
her uncle's a maudlin, twaddling,  selfish fool, and bores everybody who comes near her uncle about the state of her uncle  health."
"Men of that sort, Sir Percival, live long, and marry malevolently when you least  expect it.
I don't give you much, my friend, for your chance of the three  thousand a year.
Is there nothing more that comes to my friend from your wife?"
"Nothing."
"Absolutely nothing?"
"Absolutely nothing—except in case of your wife death."
"Aha!
in the case of her death."
There was another pause.
the Count moved from the verandah to the gravel walk  outside.
I knew that the Count had moved by the Count voice.
"The rain has come at last," I  heard the Count say.
It had come.
the state of his  health showed that It had been  falling thickly for some little time.
the Count went back under the verandah—I heard the chair creak beneath the Count  weight as the Count sat down in his  weight again.
"Well, Percival," the Count said, "and in the case of Lady Glyde death, what do you  get then?"
"If Lady Glyde leaves no children——"  "Which Lady Glyde is likely to do?"
"Which Lady Glyde is not in the least likely to do——"  "Yes?"
"Why, then I get Lady Glyde twenty thousand pounds."
"Paid down?"
"Paid down."
They were silent once more.
As They voices ceased Madame Fosco's shadow  darkened the blind again.
Instead of passing this time, it remained, for a  moment, quite still.
I saw Lady Glyde fingers steal round the corner of the blind, and  draw her fingers on one side.
The dim white outline of Lady Glyde face, looking out straight  over me, appeared behind the window.
I kept still, shrouded from head to foot  in my cloak.
The rain, which was fast wetting me, dripped over the glass,  blurred the glass, and prevented Lady Glyde from seeing anything.
"More rain!"
I heard Lady Glyde  say to Lady Glyde.
Lady Glyde dropped the blind, and I breathed again freely.
The talk went on below me, the Count resuming it this time.
"Sir Percival!
do you care about your wife?"
"Fosco!
that's rather a downright question."
"I am a downright man, and I repeat it."
"Why the devil do you look at me in that way?"
"You won't answer me?
Well, then, let us say your wife dies before the summer  is out——"  "Drop it, Fosco!"
"Let us say your wife dies——"  "Drop it, I tell you!"
"In that case, you would gain twenty thousand pounds, and you would lose——"  "I should lose the chance of three thousand a year."
"The REMOTE chance, Percival—the remote chance only.
And you want money, at  once.
In your position the gain is certain—the loss doubtful."
"Speak for yourself as well as for me.
Some of the money I want has been  borrowed for yourself.
And if you come to gain, your wife's death would be ten  thousand pounds in your wife's pocket.
Sharp as you are, you seem to have  conveniently forgotten Madame Fosco's legacy.
Don't look at me in that way!
I  won't have it!
What with your looks and your questions, upon my soul, you make  my flesh creep!"
"Your flesh?
Does flesh mean conscience in English?
I speak of your wifedeath as I speak of a possibility.
Why not?
The respectable lawyers who  scribble-scrabble your deeds and your wills look the deaths of living people in  the face.
Do lawyers make your flesh creep?
Why should I?
It is my business  to-night to clear up your position beyond the possibility of mistake, and I  have now done your position.
Here is your position.
If your wife lives, you pay those  bills with your wife signature to the parchment.
If your wife lives, you pay them with  your wife lives death."
As he spoke the light in Madame Foscoroom was extinguished, and the whole  second floor of the house was now sunk in darkness.
"Talk!
talk!"
grumbled Sir Percival.
"One would think, to hear you, that your wife's signature to the deed was got already."
"You have left the matter in my hands," retorted the Count, "and I have more  than two months before me to turn round in.
Say no more about it, if you  please, for the present.
When those  bills are due, you will see for yourself if  my 'talk!
talk!'
is worth something, or if it is not.
And now, Sir Percival, having  done with the money matters for to-night, I can place my attention at your  disposal, if you wish to consult me on that second difficulty which has mixed  itself up with our little embarrassments, and which has so altered you for the  worse, that I hardly know you again.
Speak, my friend—and pardon me if I  shock your fiery national tastes by mixing myself a second glass of  sugar-and-water."
"It's very well to say speak," replied Sir Percival, in a far more quiet and  more polite tone than Sir Percival had yet adopted, "but it's not so easy to know how to  begin."
"Shall I help you?"
suggested the Count.
"Shall I give this private difficulty  of Speak a name?
What if I call it—Anne Catherick?"
"Look here, Madame Fosco's, you and I have known each other for a long time, and if you  have helped me out of one or two scrapes before this, I have done the best I  could to help you in return, as far as money would go.
our have made as many  friendly sacrifices, on both sides, as men could, but our have had our secrets  from each other, of course—haven't our?"
"You have had a secret from me, Sir Percival.
There is a skeleton in your cupboard  here at Blackwater Park that has peeped out in these last few days at other  people besides yourself."
"Well, suppose it has.
If it doesn't concern you, you needn't be curious about  it, need you?"
"Do I look curious about it?"
"Yes, you do."
"So!
so!
my face speaks the truth, then?
What an immense foundation of good  there must be in the nature of a man who arrives at my age, and whose face has  not yet lost the habit of speaking the truth!—Come, Glyde!
let our be candid  one with the other.
the Secret has sought me: I have not sought the Secret.
Let our say I am curious—do you ask me, as your old friend, to respect your  secret, and to leave the Secret, once for all, in your own keeping?"
"Yes—that's just what I do ask."
"Then my curiosity is at an end.
my curiosity dies in me from this moment."
"Do you really mean that?"
"What makes you doubt me?"
"I have had some experience, Madame Fosco's, of your roundabout ways, and I am not so  sure that you won't worm my curiosity out of me after all."
The chair below suddenly creaked again—I felt the trellis-work pillar under  me shake from top to bottom.
the Count had started to the Count feet, and had struck  his feet with the Count hand in indignation.
"Percival!
Sir Percival!"
the Count cried passionately, "do you know me no better than  that?
Has all your experience shown you nothing of my character yet?
I am a man  of the antique type!
I am capable of the most exalted acts of virtue—when I  have the chance of performing them.
It has been the misfortune of my life that  I have had few chances.
My conception of friendship is sublime!
Is My conception of friendship my fault  that your skeleton has peeped out at me?
Why do I confess my curiosity?
You  poor superficial Englishman, it is to magnify my own self-control.
I could draw  your secret out of you, if I liked, as I draw this finger out of the palm of my  hand—you know I could!
But you have appealed to my friendship, and the duties  of friendship are sacred to me.
See!
I trample my base curiosity under his feet.
My exalted sentiments lift me above his feet.
Recognise My exalted sentiments, Sir Percival!
imitate My exalted sentiments,  Sir Percival!
Shake hands—I forgive you."
Sir Percival voice faltered over the last words—faltered, as if Sir Percival were actually  shedding tears!
Sir Percival confusedly attempted to excuse Sir Percival, but the Count was too  magnanimous to listen to Sir Percival.
"No!"
Sir Percival said.
"When my friend has wounded me, I can pardon my friend without  apologies.
Tell me, in plain words, do you want my help?"
"Yes, badly enough."
"And you can ask for it without compromising yourself?"
"I can try, at any rate."
"Try, then."
"Well, this is how it stands:—I told you to-day that I had done my best to  find Anne Catherick, and failed."
"Yes, you did."
"Fosco!
I'm a lost man if I DON'T find Anne Catherick."
"Ha!
Is it so serious as that?"
A little stream of light travelled out under the verandah, and fell over the  gravel-walk.
the Count had taken the lamp from the inner part of the room to  see my friend clearly by the light of the lamp.
"Yes!"
the Count said.
"Your face speaks the truth this time.
Serious, indeed—as  serious as the money matters the money."
"More serious.
As true as I sit here, more serious!"
the light of it disappeared again and the talk went on.
"I showed you the letter to your wife that Anne Catherick hid in the sand," Sir  Percival continued.
"There's no boasting in the letter to my wife that Anne Catherick hid in the sand, Fosco—Fosco— DOES know  the Secret."
"Say as little as possible, " Sir  Percival, in my presence, of the Secret.
Does Fosco—  know it from you?"
"No, from Fosco— mother."
"Two women in possession of your private mind—bad, bad, bad, my friend!
One  question here, before we go any farther.
The motive of your shutting up the  daughter in the asylum is now plain enough to me, but the manner of the  daughter escape  is not quite so clear.
Do you suspect the people in charge of the  daughter of closing  their eyes purposely, at the instance of some enemy who could afford to make it  worth their while?"
"No, the  daughter was the best-behaved patient they had—and, like fools, they trusted  the  daughter.
the  daughter's just mad enough to be shut up, and just sane enough to ruin me when  the  daughter's at large—if you understand that?"
"I do understand it.
Now, Sir Percival, come at once to the point, and then I shall  know what to do.
Where is the danger of your position at the present moment?"
"Anne Catherick is in this neighbourhood, and in communication with Lady  Glyde—there's the danger, plain enough.
Who can read the letter Anne Catherick hid in  the sand, and not see that your wife is in possession of the Secret, deny my wife is in possession of the Secret as  your wife may?"
"One moment, Percival.
If Lady Glyde does know the Secret, Lady Glyde must know also  that it is a compromising secret for you.
As your wife, surely it is Lady Glyde  interest to keep it?"
"Is it?
I'm coming to that.
It might be Lady Glyde interest if Lady Glyde cared two straws  about me.
But I happen to be an encumbrance in the way of another man.
Lady Glyde was  in love with another man before Lady Glyde married me—Lady Glyde's in love with him now—an  infernal vagabond of a drawing-master, named Hartright."
"My dear friend!
what is there extraordinary in that?
They are all in love with  some other man.
Who gets the first of a woman's heart?
In all my experience I  have never yet met with the man who was Number One.
Number Two, sometimes.
Number Three, Four, Five, often.
Number One, never!
the man who was Number One exists, of course—but  I have not met with the man who was Number One."
"Wait!
I haven't done yet.
Who do you think helped Anne Catherick to get the  start, when the people from the mad-house were after Anne Catherick?
Hartright.
Who do you  think saw Anne Catherick again in Cumberland?
Hartright.
Both times he spoke to Anne Catherick alone.
Stop!
don't interrupt me.
The scoundrel's as sweet on your wife as your wife is on the man who was Number One.
The scoundrel knows the Secret, and Anne Catherick knows the Secret.
Once let them both get together  again, and it's Anne Catherick interest and The scoundrel interest to turn them information against  me."
"Gently, Sir Percival—gently!
Are you insensible to the virtue of Lady Glyde?"
"That for the virtue of Lady Glyde!
I believe in nothing about Anne Catherick but Anne Catherick  money.
Don't you see how the case stands?
Anne Catherick might be harmless enough by  Anne Catherick; but if Anne Catherick and that vagabond Hartright——"  "Yes, yes, I see.
Where is Hartright?"
"Out of the country.
If he means to keep a whole skin on he bones, I recommend  he not to come back in a hurry."
"Are you sure he is out of the country?"
"Certain.
I had he watched from the time he left Cumberland to the time he  sailed.
Oh, I've been careful, I can tell you!
Anne Catherick lived with some  people at a farmhouse near Limmeridge.
I went there Anne Catherick, after Anne Catherick had given  me the slip, and made sure that they knew nothing.
I gave her mother a form of  letter to write to Miss Halcombe, exonerating me from any bad motive in putting  Anne Catherick under restraint.
I've spent, I'm afraid to say how much, in trying to trace  Anne Catherick, and in spite of it all, Anne Catherick turns up here and escapes me on my own  property!
How do I know who else may see Anne Catherick, who else may speak to Anne Catherick?
That  prying scoundrel, Hartright, may come back without my knowing it, and may make  use of Anne Catherick to-morrow——"  "Not he, Sir Percival!
While I am on the spot, and while Anne Catherick is in the  neighbourhood, I will answer for our laying hands on Anne Catherick before Mr.  Hartright—even if Mr.   does come back.
I see!
yes, yes, I see!
The finding of  Anne Catherick is the first necessity—make your mind easy about the rest.
your wife is here, under your thumb—Miss Halcombe is inseparable from your wife,  and is, therefore, under your thumb also—and Hartright is out of the country.
This invisible Anne Catherick yours is all we have to think of for the  present.
You have made your inquiries?"
"Yes.
I have been to her mother, I have ransacked the village—and all to no  purpose."
"Is her mother to be depended on?"
"Yes."
"Anne Catherick has told your secret once."
"Anne Catherick won't tell it again."
"Why not?
Are Anne Catherick own interests concerned in keeping it, as well as yours?"
"Yes—deeply concerned."
"I am glad to hear it, Sir Percival, for your sake.
Don't be discouraged, my friend.
our money matters, as I told you, leave me plenty of time to turn round  in, and I may search for Anne Catherick to-morrow to better purpose than you.
One last question before our go to bed."
"What is it?"
"it is this.
When I went to the boat-house to tell Lady Glyde that the little  difficulty of Lady Glyde signature was put off, accident took me there in time to see  a strange woman parting in a very suspicious manner from your wife.
But  accident did not bring me near enough to see this same woman's face plainly.
I  must know how to recognise our invisible Anne Catherick.
What is our invisible Anne like?"
"Like?
Come!
I'll tell you in two words.
our invisible Anne's a sickly likeness of your wife."
The chair creaked, and the pillar shook once more.
the Count was on the Count feet  again—this time in astonishment.
"What!!!"
the Count exclaimed eagerly.
"Fancy my wife, after a bad illness, with a touch of something wrong in our invisible Anne  head—and there is Anne Catherick for you," answered Sir Percival.
"Are they related to each other?"
"Not a bit of it."
"And yet so like?"
"Yes, so like.
What are you laughing about?"
There was no answer, and no sound of any kind.
the Count was laughing in the Count  smooth silent internal way.
"What are you laughing about?"
reiterated Sir Percival.
"Perhaps at my own fancies, my good friend.
Allow me my Italian humour—do I  not come of the illustrious nation which invented the exhibition of Punch?
Well, well, well, I shall know Anne Catherick when I see Anne Catherick—and so enough  for to-night.
Make your mind easy, Sir Percival.
Sleep, my son, the sleep of the  just, and see what I will do for you when daylight comes to help us both.
I  have my projects and my plans here in my big head.
You shall pay those bills  and find Anne Catherick—my sacred word of honour on Anne Catherick, but you shall!
Am I a  friend to be treasured in the best corner of your heart, or am I not?
Am I  worth those loans of money which you so delicately reminded me of a little  while since?
Whatever you do, never wound me in my sentiments any more.
Recognise my sentiments, Sir Percival!
imitate my sentiments, Sir Percival!
I forgive you again—I shake  hands again.
Good-night!"
Not another word was spoken.
I heard the Count close the library door.
I heard  Sir Percival barring up the window-shutters.
It had been raining, raining all  the time.
I was cramped by my position and chilled to the bones.
When I first  tried to move, the effort was so painful to me that I was obliged to desist.
I  tried a second time, and succeeded in rising to my knees on the wet roof.
As I crept to the wall, and raised me against the wall, I looked back, and saw  the window of the Count's dressing-room gleam into light.
My sinking courage  flickered up in me again, and kept my eyes fixed on My sinking courage   , as I stole my  way back, step by step, past the wall of the house.
The clock struck the quarter after one, when I laid my hands on the window-sill  of my own room.
I had seen nothing and heard nothing which could lead me to  suppose that my retreat had been discovered.
