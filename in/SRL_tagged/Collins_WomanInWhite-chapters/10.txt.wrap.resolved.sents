 Not a word more was said, on either side, as we walked back to the house.
Miss  Halcombe hastened immediately to Halcombe sister's room, and I withdrew to my studio  to set in order all of Mr. Fairlie's drawings that I had not yet mounted and  restored before I resigned all of Mr. Fairlie's drawings that I had not yet mounted and  restored to the care of other hands.
Thoughts that I had  hitherto restrained, thoughts that made my position harder than ever to endure,  crowded on me now that I was alone.
She was engaged to be married, and She future husband was Sir Percival Glyde.
A  man of the rank of Baronet, and the owner of property in Hampshire.
There were hundreds of baronets in England, and dozens of landowners in HampshireHampshire.
Judging by the ordinary rules of evidence, I had not the shadow of a  reason, thus far, for connecting Sir Percival Glyde with the suspicious words  of inquiry that had been spoken to me by the woman in white.
And yet, I did  connect Sir Percival Glyde with them.
Was it because Sir Percival Glyde had now become associated in my mind  with Miss Fairlie, Miss Fairlie being, in her turn, associated with Anne  Catherick, since the night when I had discovered the ominous likeness between  them?
Had the events of the morning so unnerved me already that I was at the  mercy of any delusion which common chances and common coincidences might  suggest to my imagination?
Impossible to say.
I could only feel that what had  passed between Miss Halcombe and me, on our way from the summer-house, had  affected me very strangely.
The foreboding of some undiscoverable danger lying  hid from us all in the darkness of the future was strong on me.
The doubt  whether I was not linked already to a chain of events which even my approaching  departure from Cumberland would be powerless to snap asunder—the doubt  whether we any of we saw the end as the end would really be—gathered more and  more darkly over my mind.
Poignant as it was, the sense of suffering caused by  the miserable end of my brief, presumptuous love seemed to be blunted and  deadened by the still stronger sense of something obscurely impending,  something invisibly threatening, that Time was holding over our heads.
I had been engaged with the drawings little more than half an hour, when there  was a knock at the door.
the door opened, on my answering; and, to my surprise, Miss  Halcombe entered the room.
Miss  Halcombe manner was angry and agitated.
Miss  Halcombe caught up a chair for Miss  Halcombe before I  could give Miss  Halcombe one, and sat down in her one, close at my side.
"Mr. Hartright," Miss  Halcombe said, "I had hoped that all painful subjects of  conversation were exhausted between us, for to-day at least.
But it is not to  be so.
There is some underhand villainy at work to frighten Miss  Halcombe about Miss  Halcombe  approaching marriage.
You saw me send the gardener on to the house, with a  letter addressed, in a strange handwriting, to Miss Fairlie?"
"Certainly."
"a  letter addressed, in a strange handwriting, to Miss Fairlie is an anonymous letter—a vile attempt to injure Sir Percival  Glyde in Miss  Halcombe's estimation.
a  letter addressed, in a strange handwriting, to Miss Fairlie has so agitated and alarmed Miss  Halcombe that I have  had the greatest possible difficulty in composing Miss  Halcombe spirits sufficiently to  allow me to leave Miss  Halcombe room and come here.
I know this is a family matter on  which I ought not to consult you, and in which you can feel no concern or  interest——"  "I beg your pardon, Miss Halcombe.
I feel the strongest possible concern and  interest in anything that affects Miss Fairlie's happiness or yours."
"I am glad to hear you say so.
You are the only person in the house, or out of  it, who can advise me.
Miss Fairlie, in Miss Fairlie state of health and with Miss Fairlie horror  of difficulties and mysteries of all kinds, is not to be thought of.
The  clergyman is a good, weak man, who knows nothing out of the routine of The  clergyman  duties; and our neighbours are just the sort of comfortable, jog-trot  acquaintances whom one cannot disturb in times of trouble and danger.
What I  want to know is this: ought I at once to take such steps as I can to discover  the writer of the letter?
or ought I to wait, and apply to Miss Fairlie's legal  adviser to-morrow?
It is a question—perhaps a very important one—of gaining  or losing a day.
Tell me what you think, Mr. Hartright.
If necessity had not  already obliged me to take you into my confidence under very delicate  circumstances, even my helpless situation would, perhaps, be no excuse for me.
But as things are I cannot surely be wrong, after all that has passed between  us, in forgetting that you are a friend of only three months' standing."
She gave me the letter.
the letter began abruptly, without any preliminary form of  address, as follows—   "Do you believe in dreams?
I hope, for your own sake, that you do.
See what  Scripture says about dreams and Scripture fulfilment (Genesis xl.
8, xli.
25;  Daniel iv.
18-25), and take the warning I send you before it is too late.
"Last night I dreamed about you, Miss Fairlie.
I dreamed that I was standing  inside the communion rails of a church—I on one side of the altar-table, and  the clergyman, with his surplice and his prayer-book, on the other.
"After a time there walked towards us, down the aisle of the church, a man and  a woman, coming to be married.
You were a woman.
You looked so pretty and  innocent in your beautiful white silk dress, and your long white lace veil,  that my heart felt for you, and the tears came into my eyes.
"They were tears of pity, young lady, that heaven blesses and instead of  falling from my eyes like the everyday tears that we all of us shed, They  turned into two rays of light which slanted nearer and nearer to the man  standing at the altar with you, till They touched the man   breast.
The two rays  sprang ill arches like two rainbows between me and the man  .
I looked along The two rays  ,  and I saw down into the man   inmost heart.
"The outside of the man   was fair enough to see.
the man   was  neither tall nor short—the man   was a little below the middle size.
A light,  active, high-spirited man—about five-and-forty years old, to look at.
the man   had  a pale face, and was bald over the forehead, but had dark hair on the rest of  the man   head.
the man   beard was shaven on the man   chin, but was let to grow, of a fine rich  brown, on the man   cheeks and the man   upper lip.
the man   eyes were brown too, and very  bright; the man   nose straight and handsome and delicate enough to have done for a  woman's.
the man   hands the same.
the man   was troubled from time to time with a dry  hacking cough, and when the man   put up the man   white right hand to the man   mouth, the man   showed  the red scar of an old wound across the back of it.
Have I dreamt of the right  man?
You know best, Miss Fairlie and you can say if I was deceived or not.
Read  next, what I saw beneath the outside—I entreat you, read, and profit.
"I looked along the two rays of light, and I saw down into the man   inmost heart.
It  was black as night, and on It   were written, in the red flaming letters which  are the handwriting of the fallen angel, 'Without pity and without remorse.
He  has strewn with misery the paths of others, and He will live to strew with  misery the path of this woman by He side.'
I read that, and then the rays of  light shifted and pointed over He shoulder; and there, behind He, stood a  fiend laughing.
And the rays of light shifted once more, and pointed over your  shoulder; and there behind you, stood an angel weeping.
And the rays of light  shifted for the third time, and pointed straight between you and that man.
They  widened and widened, thrusting you both asunder, one from the other.
And the  clergyman looked for the marriage-service in vain: it was gone out of the book,  and the  clergyman shut up the leaves, and put the leaves from the  clergyman in despair.
And I woke with my  eyes full of tears and my heart beating—for I believe in dreams.
"Believe too, Miss Fairlie—I beg of you, for your own sake, believe as I do.
Joseph and Daniel, and others in Scripture, believed in dreams.
Inquire into  the past life of that man with the scar on that man hand, before you say the words  that make you that man miserable wife.
I don't give you this warning on my account,  but on you.
I have an interest in your well-being that will live as long as I  draw breath.
Your mother's daughter has a tender place in my heart—for your  mother was my first, my best, my only friend."
There the extraordinary letter ended, without signature of any sort.
The handwriting afforded no prospect of a clue.
The handwriting was traced on ruled lines,  in the cramped, conventional, copy-book character technically termed "small  hand."
It was feeble and faint, and defaced by blots, but had otherwise nothing  to distinguish nothing  .
"That is not an illiterate letter," said Halcombe, "and at the same time,  it is surely too incoherent to be the letter of an educated person in the  higher ranks of life.
The reference to the bridal dress and veil, and other  little expressions, seem to point to it as the production of some woman.
What  do you think, Mr.
Hartright?"
"I think so too.
It seems to me to be not only the letter of a woman, but of a  woman whose mind must be——"  "Deranged?"
suggested Halcombe.
"It struck me in that light too."
I did not answer.
While I was speaking, my eyes rested on the last sentence of  the letter: Your mother's daughter has a tender place in my heart—for your  mother was my first, my best, my only friend."
Those words and the doubt which  had just escaped me as to the sanity of the writer of the letter, acting  together on my mind, suggested an idea, which I was literally afraid to express  openly, or even to encourage secretly.
I began to doubt whether my own  faculties were not in danger of losing my own  faculties balance.
It seemed almost like a  monomania to be tracing back everything strange that happened, everything  unexpected that was said, always to the same hidden source and the same  sinister influence.
I resolved, this time, in defence of my own courage and my  own sense, to come to no decision that plain fact did not warrant, and to turn  my back resolutely on everything that tempted me in the shape of surmise.
"If we have any chance of tracing the person who has written this," I said,  returning the letter to Halcombe, "there can be no harm in seizing we  opportunity the moment it offers.
I think we ought to speak to the gardener  again about the elderly woman who gave the gardener   the letter, and then to continue we  inquiries in the village.
But first let me ask a question.
You mentioned just  now the alternative of consulting Mr. Fairlie's legal adviser to-morrow.
Is  there no possibility of communicating with the gardener   earlier?
Why not to-day?"
"I can only explain," replied Halcombe, "by entering into certain  particulars, connected with Miss  Halcombe's marriage-engagement, which I did not  think it necessary or desirable to mention to you this morning.
One of Sir  Percival Glyde's objects in coming here on Monday, is to fix the period of Sir    marriage, which has hitherto been left quite unsettled.
Sir   is anxious that the  event should take place before the end of the year."
"Does Miss Fairlie know of that wish?"
I asked eagerly.
"Miss Fairlie has no suspicion of it, and after what has happened, I shall not take the  responsibility upon myself of enlightening Miss Fairlie.
Sir Percival has only mentioned  Sir Percival views to Mr. Fairlie, who has told me Sir Percival that Sir Percival is ready and anxious,  as Laura's guardian, to forward he is ready and anxious.
Sir Percival has written to London, to the family  solicitor, Mr. Gilmore.
Mr. Gilmore happens to be away in Glasgow on business,  and Mr. Gilmore has replied by proposing to stop at Limmeridge House on Mr. Gilmore way back to  town.
Mr. Gilmore will arrive to-morrow, and will stay with us a few days, so as to  allow Sir Percival time to plead Mr. Gilmore own cause.
If Mr. Gilmore succeeds, Mr. Gilmorewill then return to London, taking with Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore instructions for my sister's  marriage-settlement.
You understand now, Mr. Hartright, why I speak of waiting  to take legal advice until to-morrow?
Mr. Gilmore is the old and tried friend  of two generations of Fairlies, and we can trust Mr. Gilmore, as we could trust no one  else."
The marriage-settlement!
The mere hearing of those two words stung me with a  jealous despair that was poison to my higher and better instincts.
I began to  think—it is hard to confess this, but I must suppress nothing from beginning  to end of the terrible story that I now stand committed to reveal—I began to  think, with a hateful eagerness of hope, of the vague charges against Sir  Percival Glyde which the anonymous letter contained.
What if those wild  accusations rested on a foundation of truth?
What if those wild  accusations truth could be  proved before the fatal words of consent were spoken, and the  marriage-settlement was drawn?
I have tried to think since, that the feeling  which then animated me began and ended in pure devotion to Miss Fairlie's  interests, but I have never succeeded in deceiving myself into believing it,  and I must not now attempt to deceive others.
The feeling began and ended in  reckless, vindictive, hopeless hatred of the man who was to marry her.
"If we are to find out anything," I said, speaking under the new influence  which was now directing me, "we had better not let another minute slip by we  unemployed.
I can only suggest, once more, the propriety of questioning the  gardener a second time, and of inquiring in the village immediately afterwards."
"I think I may be of help to you in both cases," said Halcombe, rising.
"Let us go, Mr. Hartright, at once, and do the best us can together."
I had the door in my hand to open it for her—but I stopped, on a sudden, to  ask an important question before we set forth.
"One of the paragraphs of the anonymous letter," I said, "contains some  sentences of minute personal description.
Sir Percival Glyde's name is not  mentioned, I know—but does that description at all resemble —?"
"Accurately—even in stating — age to be forty-five——"  Forty-five; and she was not yet twenty-one!
Men of — age married wives of she  age every day—and experience had shown those marriages to be often the  happiest ones.
I knew that—and yet even the mention of — age, when I  contrasted it with hers, added to my blind hatred and distrust of —.
"Accurately," Halcombe continued, "even to the scar on — right hand,  which is the scar of a wound that — received years since when — was  travelling in Italy.
There can be no doubt that every peculiarity of —  personal appearance is thoroughly well known to the writer of the letter."
"Even a cough that — is troubled with is mentioned, if I remember right?"
"Yes, and mentioned correctly.
— treats it lightly —, though it  sometimes makes — friends anxious about —."
"I suppose no whispers have ever been heard against — character?"
"Mr. Hartright!
I hope you are not unjust enough to let that infamous letter  influence you?"
I felt the blood rush into my cheeks, for I knew that the blood rush into my cheeks HAD influenced me.
"I hope not," I answered confusedly.
"Perhaps I had no right to ask the  question."
"I am not sorry you asked no right to ask the  question," she said, "for no right to ask the  question enables me to do justice to  Sir Percival's reputation.
Not a whisper, Mr. Hartright, has ever reached me,  or my family, against  Sir Percival's reputation.
Sir Percival's reputation has fought successfully two contested elections,  and has come out of the ordeal unscathed.
A man who can do that, in England, is  a man whose character is established."
I opened the door for she in silence, and followed she out.
she had not  convinced me.
If the recording angel had come down from heaven to confirm she,  and had opened the recording angel book to my mortal eyes, the recording angel would not have  convinced me.
We found the gardener at work as usual.
No amount of questioning could extract  a single answer of any importance from the lad's impenetrable stupidity.
The  woman who had given him that infamous letter   was an elderly woman; an elderly woman had not spoken a  word to him, and an elderly woman had gone away towards the south in a great hurry.
That was  all the gardener could tell We.
the village lay southward of Limmeridge House.
So to the village We went next.
