 There was no lamp in the hall, but by the dim light of the kitchen candle,  which the girl had brought upstairs with her, I saw an elderly lady steal  noiselessly out of a back room on the ground floor. She cast one viperish look  at me as I entered the hall, but said nothing, and went slowly upstairs without  returning my bow. My familiarity with Marian's journal sufficiently assured me  that the elderly lady was Madame Fosco.  The servant led me to the room which the Countess had just left. I entered it,  and found myself face to face with the Count.  He was still in his evening dress, except his coat, which he had thrown across  a chair. His shirt-sleeves were turned up at the wrists, but no higher. A  carpet-bag was on one side of him, and a box on the other. Books, papers, and  articles of wearing apparel were scattered about the room. On a table, at one  side of the door, stood the cage, so well known to me by description, which  contained his white mice. The canaries and the cockatoo were probably in some  other room. He was seated before the box, packing it, when I went in, and rose  with some papers in his hand to receive me. His face still betrayed plain  traces of the shock that had overwhelmed him at the Opera. His fat cheeks hung  loose, his cold grey eyes were furtively vigilant, his voice, look, and manner  were all sharply suspicious alike, as he advanced a step to meet me, and  requested, with distant civility, that I would take a chair.  "You come here on business, sir?" he said. "I am at a loss to know what that  business can possibly be."  The unconcealed curiosity, with which he looked hard in my face while he spoke,  convinced me that I had passed unnoticed by him at the Opera. He had seen Pesca  first, and from that moment till he left the theatre he had evidently seen  nothing else. My name would necessarily suggest to him that I had not come into  his house with other than a hostile purpose towards himself, but he appeared to  be utterly ignorant thus far of the real nature of my errand.  "I am fortunate in finding you here to-night," I said. "You seem to be on the  point of taking a journey?"  "Is your business connected with my journey?"  "In some degree."  "In what degree? Do you know where I am going to?"  "No. I only know why you are leaving London."  He slipped by me with the quickness of thought, locked the door, and put the  key in his pocket.  "You and I, Mr. Hartright, are excellently well acquainted with one another by  reputation," he said. "Did it, by any chance, occur to you when you came to  this house that I was not the sort of man you could trifle with?"  "It did occur to me," I replied. "And I have not come to trifle with you. I am  here on a matter of life and death, and if that door which you have locked was  open at this moment, nothing you could say or do would induce me to pass  through it."  I walked farther into the room, and stood opposite to him on the rug before the  fireplace. He drew a chair in front of the door, and sat down on it, with his  left arm resting on the table. The cage with the white mice was close to him,  and the little creatures scampered out of their sleeping-place as his heavy arm  shook the table, and peered at him through the gaps in the smartly painted  wires.  "On a matter of life and death," he repeated to himself. "Those words are more  serious, perhaps, than you think. What do you mean?"  "What I say."  The perspiration broke out thickly on his broad forehead. His left hand stole  over the edge of the table. There was a drawer in it, with a lock, and the key  was in the lock. His finger and thumb closed over the key, but did not turn it.  "So you know why I am leaving London?" he went on. "Tell me the reason, if you  please." He turned the key, and unlocked the drawer as he spoke.  "I can do better than that," I replied. "I can SHOW you the reason, if you  like."  "How can you show it?"  "You have got your coat off," I said. "Roll up the shirt-sleeve on your left  arm, and you will see it there."  The same livid leaden change passed over his face which I had seen pass over it  at the theatre. The deadly glitter in his eyes shone steady and straight into  mine. He said nothing. But his left hand slowly opened the table-drawer, and  softly slipped into it. The harsh grating noise of something heavy that he was  moving unseen to me sounded for a moment, then ceased. The silence that  followed was so intense that the faint ticking nibble of the white mice at  their wires was distinctly audible where I stood.  My life hung by a thread, and I knew it. At that final moment I thought with  HIS mind, I felt with HIS fingers—I was as certain as if I had seen it of  what he kept hidden from me in the drawer.  "Wait a little," I said. "You have got the door locked—you see I don't  move—you see my hands are empty. Wait a little. I have something more to say."  "You have said enough," he replied, with a sudden composure so unnatural and so  ghastly that it tried my nerves as no outbreak of violence could have tried  them. "I want one moment for my own thoughts, if you please. Do you guess what  I am thinking about?"  "Perhaps I do."  "I am thinking," he remarked quietly, "whether I shall add to the disorder in  this room by scattering your brains about the fireplace."  If I had moved at that moment, I saw in his face that he would have done it.  "I advise you to read two lines of writing which I have about me," I rejoined,  "before you finally decide that question."  The proposal appeared to excite his curiosity. He nodded his head. I took  Pesca's acknowledgment of the receipt of my letter out of my pocket-book,  handed it to him at arm's length, and returned to my former position in front  of the fireplace.  He read the lines aloud: "Your letter is received. If I don't hear from you  before the time you mention, I will break the seal when the clock strikes."  Another man in his position would have needed some explanation of those  words—the Count felt no such necessity. One reading of the note showed him  the precaution that I had taken as plainly as if he had been present at the  time when I adopted it. The expression of his face changed on the instant, and  his hand came out of the drawer empty.  "I don't lock up my drawer, Mr. Hartright," he said, "and I don't say that I  may not scatter your brains about the fireplace yet. But I am a just man even  to my enemy, and I will acknowledge beforehand that they are cleverer brains  than I thought them. Come to the point, sir! You want something of me?"  "I do, and I mean to have it."  "On conditions?"  "On no conditions."  His hand dropped into the drawer again.  "Bah! we are travelling in a circle," he said, "and those clever brains of  yours are in danger again. Your tone is deplorably imprudent, sir—moderate it  on the spot! The risk of shooting you on the place where you stand is less to  me than the risk of letting you out of this house, except on conditions that I  dictate and approve. You have not got my lamented friend to deal with now—you  are face to face with Fosco! If the lives of twenty Mr. Hartrights were the  stepping-stones to my safety, over all those stones I would go, sustained by my  sublime indifference, self-balanced by my impenetrable calm. Respect me, if you  love your own life! I summon you to answer three questions before you open your  lips again. Hear them—they are necessary to this interview. Answer  them—they are necessary to ME." He held up one finger of his right hand.  "First question!" he said. "You come here possessed of information which may be  true or may be false—where did you get it?"  "I decline to tell you."  "No matter—I shall find out. If that information is true—mind I say, with  the whole force of my resolution, if—you are making your market of it here by  treachery of your own or by treachery of some other man. I note that  circumstance for future use in my memory, which forgets nothing, and proceed."  He held up another finger. "Second question! Those lines you invited me to read  are without signature. Who wrote them?"  "A man whom I have every reason to depend on, and whom you have every reason to  fear."  My answer reached him to some purpose. His left hand trembled audibly in the  drawer.  "How long do you give me," he asked, putting his third question in a quieter  tone, "before the clock strikes and the seal is broken?"  "Time enough for you to come to my terms," I replied.  "Give me a plainer answer, Mr. Hartright. What hour is the clock to strike?"  "Nine, to-morrow morning."  "Nine, to-morrow morning? Yes, yes—your trap is laid for me before I can get  my passport regulated and leave London. It is not earlier, I suppose? We will  see about that presently—I can keep you hostage here, and bargain with you to  send for your letter before I let you go. In the meantime, be so good next as  to mention your terms."  "You shall hear them. They are simple, and soon stated. You know whose  interests I represent in coming here?"  He smiled with the most supreme composure, and carelessly waved his right hand.  "I consent to hazard a guess," he said jeeringly. "A lady's interests, of  course!"  "My Wife's interests."  He looked at me with the first honest expression that had crossed his face in  my presence—an expression of blank amazement. I could see that I sank in his  estimation as a dangerous man from that moment. He shut up the drawer at once,  folded his arms over his breast, and listened to me with a smile of satirical  attention.  "You are well enough aware," I went on, "of the course which my inquiries have  taken for many months past, to know that any attempted denial of plain facts  will be quite useless in my presence. You are guilty of an infamous conspiracy!  And the gain of a fortune of ten thousand pounds was your motive for it."  He said nothing. But his face became overclouded suddenly by a lowering anxiety.  "Keep your gain," I said. (His face lightened again immediately, and his eyes  opened on me in wider and wider astonishment.) "I am not here to disgrace  myself by bargaining for money which has passed through your hands, and which  has been the price of a vile crime.  "Gently, Mr. Hartright. Your moral clap-traps have an excellent effect in  England—keep them for yourself and your own countrymen, if you please. The  ten thousand pounds was a legacy left to my excellent wife by the late Mr.  Fairlie. Place the affair on those grounds, and I will discuss it if you like.  To a man of my sentiments, however, the subject is deplorably sordid. I prefer  to pass it over. I invite you to resume the discussion of your terms. What do  you demand?"  "In the first place, I demand a full confession of the conspiracy, written and  signed in my presence by yourself."  He raised his finger again. "One!" he said, checking me off with the steady  attention of a practical man.  "In the second place, I demand a plain proof, which does not depend on your  personal asseveration, of the date at which my wife left Blackwater Park and  travelled to London."  "So! so! you can lay your finger, I see, on the weak place," he remarked  composedly. "Any more?"  "At present, no more."  "Good! you have mentioned your terms, now listen to mine. The responsibility to  myself of admitting what you are pleased to call the 'conspiracy' is less,  perhaps, upon the whole, than the responsibility of laying you dead on that  hearthrug. Let us say that I meet your proposal—on my own conditions. The  statement you demand of me shall be written, and the plain proof shall be  produced. You call a letter from my late lamented friend informing me of the  day and hour of his wife's arrival in London, written, signed, and dated by  himself, a proof, I suppose? I can give you this. I can also send you to the  man of whom I hired the carriage to fetch my visitor from the railway, on the  day when she arrived—his order-book may help you to your date, even if his  coachman who drove me proves to be of no use. These things I can do, and will  do, on conditions. I recite them. First condition! Madame Fosco and I leave  this house when and how we please, without interference of any kind on your  part. Second condition! You wait here, in company with me, to see my agent, who  is coming at seven o'clock in the morning to regulate my affairs. You give my  agent a written order to the man who has got your sealed letter to resign his  possession of it. You wait here till my agent places that letter unopened in my  hands, and you then allow me one clear half-hour to leave the house—after  which you resume your own freedom of action and go where you please. Third  condition! You give me the satisfaction of a gentleman for your intrusion into  my private affairs, and for the language you have allowed yourself to use to me  at this conference. The time and place, abroad, to be fixed in a letter from my  hand when I am safe on the Continent, and that letter to contain a strip of  paper measuring accurately the length of my sword. Those are my terms. Inform  me if you accept them—Yes or No."   The extraordinary mixture of prompt decision, far-sighted cunning, and  mountebank bravado in this speech, staggered me for a moment—and only for a  moment. The one question to consider was, whether I was justified or not in  possessing myself of the means of establishing Laura's identity at the cost of  allowing the scoundrel who had robbed her of it to escape me with impunity. I  knew that the motive of securing the just recognition of my wife in the  birthplace from which she had been driven out as an impostor, and of publicly  erasing the lie that still profaned her mother's tombstone, was far purer, in  its freedom from all taint of evil passion, than the vindictive motive which  had mingled itself with my purpose from the first. And yet I cannot honestly  say that my own moral convictions were strong enough to decide the struggle in  me by themselves. They were helped by my remembrance of Sir Percival's death.  How awfully, at the last moment, had the working of the retribution THERE been  snatched from my feeble hands! What right had I to decide, in my poor mortal  ignorance of the future, that this man, too, must escape with impunity because  he escaped ME? I thought of these things—perhaps with the superstition  inherent in my nature, perhaps with a sense worthier of me than superstition.  It was hard, when I had fastened my hold on him at last, to loosen it again of  my own accord—but I forced myself to make the sacrifice. In plainer words, I  determined to be guided by the one higher motive of which I was certain, the  motive of serving the cause of Laura and the cause of Truth.   "I accept your conditions," I said. "With one reservation on my part."  "What reservation may that be?" he asked.  "It refers to the sealed letter," I answered. "I require you to destroy it  unopened in my presence as soon as it is placed in your hands."  My object in making this stipulation was simply to prevent him from carrying  away written evidence of the nature of my communication with Pesca. The fact of  my communication he would necessarily discover, when I gave the address to his  agent in the morning. But he could make no use of it on his own unsupported  testimony—even if he really ventured to try the experiment—which need  excite in me the slightest apprehension on Pesca's account.  "I grant your reservation," he replied, after considering the question gravely  for a minute or two. "It is not worth dispute—the letter shall be destroyed  when it comes into my hands."  He rose, as he spoke, from the chair in which he had been sitting opposite to  me up to this time. With one effort he appeared to free his mind from the whole  pressure on it of the interview between us thus far. "Ouf!" he cried,  stretching his arms luxuriously, "the skirmish was hot while it lasted. Take a  seat, Mr. Hartright. We meet as mortal enemies hereafter—let us, like gallant  gentlemen, exchange polite attentions in the meantime. Permit me to take the  liberty of calling for my wife."  He unlocked and opened the door. "Eleanor!" he called out in his deep voice.  The lady of the viperish face came in "Madame Fosco—Mr. Hartright," said the  Count, introducing us with easy dignity. "My angel," he went on, addressing his  wife, "will your labours of packing up allow you time to make me some nice  strong coffee? I have writing business to transact with Mr. Hartright—and I  require the full possession of my intelligence to do justice to myself."  Madame Fosco bowed her head twice—once sternly to me, once submissively to  her husband, and glided out of the room.  The Count walked to a writing-table near the window, opened his desk, and took  from it several quires of paper and a bundle of quill pens. He scattered the  pens about the table, so that they might lie ready in all directions to be  taken up when wanted, and then cut the paper into a heap of narrow slips, of  the form used by professional writers for the press. "I shall make this a  remarkable document," he said, looking at me over his shoulder. "Habits of  literary composition are perfectly familiar to me. One of the rarest of all the  intellectual accomplishments that a man can possess is the grand faculty of  arranging his ideas. Immense privilege! I possess it. Do you?"  He marched backwards and forwards in the room, until the coffee appeared,  humming to himself, and marking the places at which obstacles occurred in the  arrangement of his ideas, by striking his forehead from time to time with the  palm of his hand. The enormous audacity with which he seized on the situation  in which I placed him, and made it the pedestal on which his vanity mounted for  the one cherished purpose of self-display, mastered my astonishment by main  force. Sincerely as I loathed the man, the prodigious strength of his  character, even in its most trivial aspects, impressed me in spite of myself.  The coffee was brought in by Madame Fosco. He kissed her hand in grateful  acknowledgment, and escorted her to the door; returned, poured out a cup of  coffee for himself, and took it to the writing-table.  "May I offer you some coffee, Mr. Hartright?" he said, before he sat down.  I declined.  "What! you think I shall poison you?" he said gaily. "The English intellect is  sound, so far as it goes," he continued, seating himself at the table; "but it  has one grave defect—it is always cautious in the wrong place."  He dipped his pen in the ink, placed the first slip of paper before him with a  thump of his hand on the desk, cleared his throat, and began. He wrote with  great noise and rapidity, in so large and bold a hand, and with such wide  spaces between the lines, that he reached the bottom of the slip in not more  than two minutes certainly from the time when he started at the top. Each slip  as he finished it was paged, and tossed over his shoulder out of his way on the  floor. When his first pen was worn out, THAT went over his shoulder too, and he  pounced on a second from the supply scattered about the table. Slip after slip,  by dozens, by fifties, by hundreds, flew over his shoulders on either side of  him till he had snowed himself up in paper all round his chair. Hour after hour  passed—and there I sat watching, there he sat writing. He never stopped,  except to sip his coffee, and when that was exhausted, to smack his forehead  from time to time. One o'clock struck, two, three, four—and still the slips  flew about all round him; still the untiring pen scraped its way ceaselessly  from top to bottom of the page, still the white chaos of paper rose higher and  higher all round his chair. At four o'clock I heard a sudden splutter of the  pen, indicative of the flourish with which he signed his name. "Bravo!" he  cried, springing to his feet with the activity of a young man, and looking me  straight in the face with a smile of superb triumph.  "Done, Mr. Hartright!" he announced with a self-renovating thump of his fist on  his broad breast. "Done, to my own profound satisfaction—to YOUR profound  astonishment, when you read what I have written. The subject is exhausted: the  man—Fosco—is not. I proceed to the arrangement of my slips—to the  revision of my slips—to the reading of my slips—addressed emphatically to  your private ear. Four o'clock has just struck. Good! Arrangement, revision,  reading, from four to five. Short snooze of restoration for myself from five to  six. Final preparations from six to seven. Affair of agent and sealed letter  from seven to eight. At eight, en route. Behold the programme!"  He sat down cross-legged on the floor among his papers, strung them together  with a bodkin and a piece of string—revised them, wrote all the titles and  honours by which he was personally distinguished at the head of the first page,  and then read the manuscript to me with loud theatrical emphasis and profuse  theatrical gesticulation. The reader will have an opportunity, ere long, of  forming his own opinion of the document. It will be sufficient to mention here  that it answered my purpose.  He next wrote me the address of the person from whom he had hired the fly, and  handed me Sir Percival's letter. It was dated from Hampshire on the 25th of  July, and it announced the journey of "Lady Glyde" to London on the 26th. Thus,  on the very day (the 25th) when the doctor's certificate declared that she had  died in St. John's Wood, she was alive, by Sir Percival's own showing, at  Blackwater—and, on the day after, she was to take a journey! When the proof  of that journey was obtained from the flyman, the evidence would be complete.  "A quarter-past five," said the Count, looking at his watch. "Time for my  restorative snooze. I personally resemble Napoleon the Great, as you may have  remarked, Mr. Hartright—I also resemble that immortal man in my power of  commanding sleep at will. Excuse me one moment. I will summon Madame Fosco, to  keep you from feeling dull."  Knowing as well as he did, that he was summoning Madame Fosco to ensure my not  leaving the house while he was asleep, I made no reply, and occupied myself in  tying up the papers which he had placed in my possession.  The lady came in, cool, pale, and venomous as ever. "Amuse Mr. Hartright, my  angel," said the Count. He placed a chair for her, kissed her hand for the  second time, withdrew to a sofa, and, in three minutes, was as peacefully and  happily asleep as the most virtuous man in existence.  Madame Fosco took a book from the table, sat down, and looked at me, with the  steady vindictive malice of a woman who never forgot and never forgave.  "I have been listening to your conversation with my husband," she said. "If I  had been in HIS place—I would have laid you dead on the hearthrug."  With those words she opened her book, and never looked at me or spoke to me  from that time till the time when her husband woke.  He opened his eyes and rose from the sofa, accurately to an hour from the time  when he had gone to sleep.  "I feel infinitely refreshed," he remarked. "Eleanor, my good wife, are you all  ready upstairs? That is well. My little packing here can be completed in ten  minutes—my travelling-dress assumed in ten minutes more. What remains before  the agent comes?" He looked about the room, and noticed the cage with his white  mice in it. "Ah!" he cried piteously, "a last laceration of my sympathies still  remains. My innocent pets! my little cherished children! what am I to do with  them? For the present we are settled nowhere; for the present we travel  incessantly—the less baggage we carry the better for ourselves. My cockatoo,  my canaries, and my little mice—who will cherish them when their good Papa is  gone?"  He walked about the room deep in thought. He had not been at all troubled about  writing his confession, but he was visibly perplexed and distressed about the  far more important question of the disposal of his pets. After long  consideration he suddenly sat down again at the writing-table.  "An idea!" he exclaimed. "I will offer my canaries and my cockatoo to this vast  Metropolis—my agent shall present them in my name to the Zoological Gardens  of London. The Document that describes them shall be drawn out on the spot."  He began to write, repeating the words as they flowed from his pen.  "Number one. Cockatoo of transcendent plumage: attraction, of himself, to all  visitors of taste. Number two. Canaries of unrivalled vivacity and  intelligence: worthy of the garden of Eden, worthy also of the garden in the  Regent's Park. Homage to British Zoology. Offered by Fosco."  The pen spluttered again, and the flourish was attached to his signature.  "Count! you have not included the mice," said Madame Fosco  He left the table, took her hand, and placed it on his heart.  "All human resolution, Eleanor," he said solemnly, "has its limits. MY limits  are inscribed on that Document. I cannot part with my white mice. Bear with me,  my angel, and remove them to their travelling cage upstairs."  "Admirable tenderness!" said Madame Fosco, admiring her husband, with a last  viperish look in my direction. She took up the cage carefully, and left the  room.  The Count looked at his watch. In spite of his resolute assumption of  composure, he was getting anxious for the agent's arrival. The candles had long  since been extinguished, and the sunlight of the new morning poured into the  room. It was not till five minutes past seven that the gate bell rang, and the  agent made his appearance. He was a foreigner with a dark beard.  "Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle," said the Count, introducing us. He took the  agent (a foreign spy, in every line of his face, if ever there was one yet)  into a corner of the room, whispered some directions to him, and then left us  together. "Monsieur Rubelle," as soon as we were alone, suggested with great  politeness that I should favour him with his instructions. I wrote two lines to  Pesca, authorising him to deliver my sealed letter "to the bearer," directed  the note, and handed it to Monsieur Rubelle.  The agent waited with me till his employer returned, equipped in travelling  costume. The Count examined the address of my letter before he dismissed the  agent. "I thought so!" he said, turning on me with a dark look, and altering  again in his manner from that moment.  He completed his packing, and then sat consulting a travelling map, making  entries in his pocket-book, and looking every now and then impatiently at his  watch. Not another word, addressed to myself, passed his lips. The near  approach of the hour for his departure, and the proof he had seen of the  communication established between Pesca and myself, had plainly recalled his  whole attention to the measures that were necessary for securing his escape.  A little before eight o'clock, Monsieur Rubelle came back with my unopened  letter in his hand. The Count looked carefully at the superscription and the  seal, lit a candle, and burnt the letter. "I perform my promise," he said, "but  this matter, Mr. Hartright, shall not end here."  The agent had kept at the door the cab in which he had returned. He and the  maid-servant now busied themselves in removing the luggage. Madame Fosco came  downstairs, thickly veiled, with the travelling cage of the white mice in her  hand. She neither spoke to me nor looked towards me. Her husband escorted her  to the cab. "Follow me as far as the passage," he whispered in my ear; "I may  want to speak to you at the last moment."  I went out to the door, the agent standing below me in the front garden. The  Count came back alone, and drew me a few steps inside the passage.  "Remember the Third condition!" he whispered. "You shall hear from me, Mr.  Hartright—I may claim from you the satisfaction of a gentleman sooner than  you think for." He caught my hand before I was aware of him, and wrung it  hard—then turned to the door, stopped, and came back to me again.  "One word more," he said confidentially. "When I last saw Miss Halcombe, she  looked thin and ill. I am anxious about that admirable woman. Take care of her,  sir! With my hand on my heart, I solemnly implore you, take care of Miss  Halcombe!"  Those were the last words he said to me before he squeezed his huge body into  the cab and drove off.  The agent and I waited at the door a few moments looking after him. While we  were standing together, a second cab appeared from a turning a little way down  the road. It followed the direction previously taken by the Count's cab, and as  it passed the house and the open garden gate, a person inside looked at us out  of the window. The stranger at the Opera again!—the foreigner with a scar on  his left cheek.   "You wait here with me, sir, for half an hour more!" said Monsieur Rubelle.  "I do."  We returned to the sitting-room. I was in no humour to speak to the agent, or  to allow him to speak to me. I took out the papers which the Count had placed  in my hands, and read the terrible story of the conspiracy told by the man who  had planned and perpetrated it.     THE STORY CONTINUED BY ISIDOR, OTTAVIO, BALDASSARE FOSCO  (Count of the Holy Roman Empire, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Brazen  Crown, Perpetual Arch-Master of the Rosicrucian Masons of Mesopotamia; Attached  (in Honorary Capacities) to Societies Musical, Societies Medical, Societies  Philosophical, and Societies General Benevolent, throughout Europe; etc. etc.  etc.)   THE COUNT'S NARRATIVE  In the summer of eighteen hundred and fifty I arrived in England, charged with  a delicate political mission from abroad. Confidential persons were  semi-officially connected with me, whose exertions I was authorised to direct,  Monsieur and Madame Rubelle being among the number. Some weeks of spare time  were at my disposal, before I entered on my functions by establishing myself in  the suburbs of London. Curiosity may stop here to ask for some explanation of  those functions on my part. I entirely sympathise with the request. I also  regret that diplomatic reserve forbids me to comply with it.  I arranged to pass the preliminary period of repose, to which I have just  referred, in the superb mansion of my late lamented friend, Sir Percival Glyde.  HE arrived from the Continent with his wife. I arrived from the Continent with  MINE. England is the land of domestic happiness—how appropriately we entered  it under these domestic circumstances!  The bond of friendship which united Percival and myself was strengthened, on  this occasion, by a touching similarity in the pecuniary position on his side  and on mine. We both wanted money. Immense necessity! Universal want! Is there  a civilised human being who does not feel for us? How insensible must that man  be! Or how rich!  I enter into no sordid particulars, in discussing this part of the subject. My  mind recoils from them. With a Roman austerity, I show my empty purse and  Percival's to the shrinking public gaze. Let us allow the deplorable fact to  assert itself, once for all, in that manner, and pass on.  We were received at the mansion by the magnificent creature who is inscribed on  my heart as "Marian," who is known in the colder atmosphere of society as "Miss  Halcombe."  Just Heaven! with what inconceivable rapidity I learnt to adore that woman. At  sixty, I worshipped her with the volcanic ardour of eighteen. All the gold of  my rich nature was poured hopelessly at her feet. My wife—poor angel!—my  wife, who adores me, got nothing but the shillings and the pennies. Such is the  World, such Man, such Love. What are we (I ask) but puppets in a show-box? Oh,  omnipotent Destiny, pull our strings gently! Dance us mercifully off our  miserable little stage!  The preceding lines, rightly understood, express an entire system of  philosophy. It is mine.  I resume.   The domestic position at the commencement of our residence at Blackwater Park  has been drawn with amazing accuracy, with profound mental insight, by the hand  of Marian herself. (Pass me the intoxicating familiarity of mentioning this  sublime creature by her Christian name.) Accurate knowledge of the contents of  her journal—to which I obtained access by clandestine means, unspeakably  precious to me in the remembrance—warns my eager pen from topics which this  essentially exhaustive woman has already made her own.  The interests—interests, breathless and immense!—with which I am here  concerned, begin with the deplorable calamity of Marian's illness.  The situation at this period was emphatically a serious one. Large sums of  money, due at a certain time, were wanted by Percival (I say nothing of the  modicum equally necessary to myself), and the one source to look to for  supplying them was the fortune of his wife, of which not one farthing was at  his disposal until her death. Bad so far, and worse still farther on. My  lamented friend had private troubles of his own, into which the delicacy of my  disinterested attachment to him forbade me from inquiring too curiously. I knew  nothing but that a woman, named Anne Catherick, was hidden in the  neighbourhood, that she was in communication with Lady Glyde, and that the  disclosure of a secret, which would be the certain ruin of Percival, might be  the result. He had told me himself that he was a lost man, unless his wife was  silenced, and unless Anne Catherick was found. If he was a lost man, what would  become of our pecuniary interests? Courageous as I am by nature, I absolutely  trembled at the idea!  The whole force of my intelligence was now directed to the finding of Anne  Catherick. Our money affairs, important as they were, admitted of delay—but  the necessity of discovering the woman admitted of none. I only knew her by  description, as presenting an extraordinary personal resemblance to Lady Glyde.  The statement of this curious fact—intended merely to assist me in  identifying the person of whom we were in search—when coupled with the  additional information that Anne Catherick had escaped from a mad-house,  started the first immense conception in my mind, which subsequently led to such  amazing results. That conception involved nothing less than the complete  transformation of two separate identities. Lady Glyde and Anne Catherick were  to change names, places, and destinies, the one with the other—the prodigious  consequences contemplated by the change being the gain of thirty thousand  pounds, and the eternal preservation of Sir Percival's secret.  My instincts (which seldom err) suggested to me, on reviewing the  circumstances, that our invisible Anne would, sooner or later, return to the  boat-house at the Blackwater lake. There I posted myself, previously mentioning  to Mrs. Michelson, the housekeeper, that I might be found when wanted, immersed  in study, in that solitary place. It is my rule never to make unnecessary  mysteries, and never to set people suspecting me for want of a little  seasonable candour on my part. Mrs. Michelson believed in me from first to  last. This ladylike person (widow of a Protestant priest) overflowed with  faith. Touched by such superfluity of simple confidence in a woman of her  mature years, I opened the ample reservoirs of my nature and absorbed it all.  I was rewarded for posting myself sentinel at the lake by the appearance—not  of Anne Catherick herself, but of the person in charge of her. This individual  also overflowed with simple faith, which I absorbed in myself, as in the case  already mentioned. I leave her to describe the circumstances (if she has not  done so already) under which she introduced me to the object of her maternal  care. When I first saw Anne Catherick she was asleep. I was electrified by the  likeness between this unhappy woman and Lady Glyde. The details of the grand  scheme which had suggested themselves in outline only, up to that period,  occurred to me, in all their masterly combination, at the sight of the sleeping  face. At the same time, my heart, always accessible to tender influences,  dissolved in tears at the spectacle of suffering before me. I instantly set  myself to impart relief. In other words, I provided the necessary stimulant for  strengthening Anne Catherick to perform the journey to London.   The best years of my life have been passed in the ardent study of medical and  chemical science. Chemistry especially has always had irresistible attractions  for me from the enormous, the illimitable power which the knowledge of it  confers. Chemists—I assert it emphatically—might sway, if they pleased, the  destinies of humanity. Let me explain this before I go further.  Mind, they say, rules the world. But what rules the mind? The body (follow me  closely here) lies at the mercy of the most omnipotent of all potentates—the  Chemist. Give me—Fosco—chemistry; and when Shakespeare has conceived  Hamlet, and sits down to execute the conception—with a few grains of powder  dropped into his daily food, I will reduce his mind, by the action of his body,  till his pen pours out the most abject drivel that has ever degraded paper.  Under similar circumstances, revive me the illustrious Newton. I guarantee that  when he sees the apple fall he shall EAT IT, instead of discovering the  principle of gravitation. Nero's dinner shall transform Nero into the mildest  of men before he has done digesting it, and the morning draught of Alexander  the Great shall make Alexander run for his life at the first sight of the enemy  the same afternoon. On my sacred word of honour it is lucky for Society that  modern chemists are, by incomprehensible good fortune, the most harmless of  mankind. The mass are worthy fathers of families, who keep shops. The few are  philosophers besotted with admiration for the sound of their own lecturing  voices, visionaries who waste their lives on fantastic impossibilities, or  quacks whose ambition soars no higher than our corns. Thus Society escapes, and  the illimitable power of Chemistry remains the slave of the most superficial  and the most insignificant ends.  Why this outburst? Why this withering eloquence?  Because my conduct has been misrepresented, because my motives have been  misunderstood. It has been assumed that I used my vast chemical resources  against Anne Catherick, and that I would have used them if I could against the  magnificent Marian herself. Odious insinuations both! All my interests were  concerned (as will be seen presently) in the preservation of Anne Catherick's  life. All my anxieties were concentrated on Marian's rescue from the hands of  the licensed imbecile who attended her, and who found my advice confirmed from  first to last by the physician from London. On two occasions only—both  equally harmless to the individual on whom I practised—did I summon to myself  the assistance of chemical knowledge. On the first of the two, after following  Marian to the inn at Blackwater (studying, behind a convenient waggon which hid  me from her, the poetry of motion, as embodied in her walk), I availed myself  of the services of my invaluable wife, to copy one and to intercept the other  of two letters which my adored enemy had entrusted to a discarded maid. In this  case, the letters being in the bosom of the girl's dress, Madame Fosco could  only open them, read them, perform her instructions, seal them, and put them  back again by scientific assistance—which assistance I rendered in a  half-ounce bottle. The second occasion, when the same means were employed, was  the occasion (to which I shall soon refer) of Lady Glyde's arrival in London.  Never at any other time was I indebted to my Art as distinguished from myself.  To all other emergencies and complications my natural capacity for grappling,  single-handed, with circumstances, was invariably equal. I affirm the  all-pervading intelligence of that capacity. At the expense of the Chemist I  vindicate the Man.  Respect this outburst of generous indignation. It has inexpressibly relieved  me. En route! Let us proceed.   Having suggested to Mrs. Clement (or Clements, I am not sure which) that the  best method of keeping Anne out of Percival's reach was to remove her to  London—having found that my proposal was eagerly received, and having  appointed a day to meet the travellers at the station and to see them leave it,  I was at liberty to return to the house and to confront the difficulties which  still remained to be met.  My first proceeding was to avail myself of the sublime devotion of my wife. I  had arranged with Mrs. Clements that she should communicate her London address,  in Anne's interests, to Lady Glyde. But this was not enough. Designing persons  in my absence might shake the simple confidence of Mrs. Clements, and she might  not write after all. Who could I find capable of travelling to London by the  train she travelled by, and of privately seeing her home? I asked myself this  question. The conjugal part of me immediately answered—Madame Fosco.  After deciding on my wife's mission to London, I arranged that the journey  should serve a double purpose. A nurse for the suffering Marian, equally  devoted to the patient and to myself, was a necessity of my position. One of  the most eminently confidential and capable women in existence was by good  fortune at my disposal. I refer to that respectable matron, Madame Rubelle, to  whom I addressed a letter, at her residence in London, by the hands of my wife.  On the appointed day Mrs. Clements and Anne Catherick met me at the station. I  politely saw them off, I politely saw Madame Fosco off by the same train. The  last thing at night my wife returned to Blackwater, having followed her  instructions with the most unimpeachable accuracy. She was accompanied by  Madame Rubelle, and she brought me the London address of Mrs. Clements.  After-events proved this last precaution to have been unnecessary. Mrs.  Clements punctually informed Lady Glyde of her place of abode. With a wary eye  on future emergencies, I kept the letter.  The same day I had a brief interview with the doctor, at which I protested, in  the sacred interests of humanity, against his treatment of Marian's case. He  was insolent, as all ignorant people are. I showed no resentment, I deferred  quarrelling with him till it was necessary to quarrel to some purpose. My next  proceeding was to leave Blackwater myself. I had my London residence to take in  anticipation of coming events. I had also a little business of the domestic  sort to transact with Mr. Frederick Fairlie. I found the house I wanted in St.  John's Wood. I found Mr. Fairlie at Limmeridge, Cumberland.  My own private familiarity with the nature of Marian's correspondence had  previously informed me that she had written to Mr. Fairlie, proposing, as a  relief to Lady Glyde's matrimonial embarrassments, to take her on a visit to  her uncle in Cumberland. This letter I had wisely allowed to reach its  destination, feeling at the time that it could do no harm, and might do good. I  now presented myself before Mr. Fairlie to support Marian's own proposal—with  certain modifications which, happily for the success of my plans, were rendered  really inevitable by her illness. It was necessary that Lady Glyde should leave  Blackwater alone, by her uncle's invitation, and that she should rest a night  on the journey at her aunt's house (the house I had in St. John's Wood) by her  uncle's express advice. To achieve these results, and to secure a note of  invitation which could be shown to Lady Glyde, were the objects of my visit to  Mr. Fairlie. When I have mentioned that this gentleman was equally feeble in  mind and body, and that I let loose the whole force of my character on him, I  have said enough. I came, saw, and conquered Fairlie.  On my return to Blackwater Park (with the letter of invitation) I found that  the doctor's imbecile treatment of Marian's case had led to the most alarming  results. The fever had turned to typhus. Lady Glyde, on the day of my return,  tried to force herself into the room to nurse her sister. She and I had no  affinities of sympathy—she had committed the unpardonable outrage on my  sensibilities of calling me a spy—she was a stumbling-block in my way and in  Percival's—but, for all that, my magnanimity forbade me to put her in danger  of infection with my own hand. At the same time I offered no hindrance to her  putting herself in danger. If she had succeeded in doing so, the intricate knot  which I was slowly and patiently operating on might perhaps have been cut by  circumstances. As it was, the doctor interfered and she was kept out of the  room.  I had myself previously recommended sending for advice to London. This course  had been now taken. The physician, on his arrival, confirmed my view of the  case. The crisis was serious. But we had hope of our charming patient on the  fifth day from the appearance of the typhus. I was only once absent from  Blackwater at this time—when I went to London by the morning train to make  the final arrangements at my house in St. John's Wood, to assure myself by  private inquiry that Mrs. Clements had not moved, and to settle one or two  little preliminary matters with the husband of Madame Rubelle. I returned at  night. Five days afterwards the physician pronounced our interesting Marian to  be out of all danger, and to be in need of nothing but careful nursing. This  was the time I had waited for. Now that medical attendance was no longer  indispensable, I played the first move in the game by asserting myself against  the doctor. He was one among many witnesses in my way whom it was necessary to  remove. A lively altercation between us (in which Percival, previously  instructed by me, refused to interfere) served the purpose in view. I descended  on the miserable man in an irresistible avalanche of indignation, and swept him  from the house.  The servants were the next encumbrances to get rid of. Again I instructed  Percival (whose moral courage required perpetual stimulants), and Mrs.  Michelson was amazed, one day, by hearing from her master that the  establishment was to be broken up. We cleared the house of all the servants but  one, who was kept for domestic purposes, and whose lumpish stupidity we could  trust to make no embarrassing discoveries. When they were gone, nothing  remained but to relieve ourselves of Mrs. Michelson—a result which was easily  achieved by sending this amiable lady to find lodgings for her mistress at the  sea-side.  The circumstances were now exactly what they were required to be. Lady Glyde  was confined to her room by nervous illness, and the lumpish housemaid (I  forget her name) was shut up there at night in attendance on her mistress.  Marian, though fast recovering, still kept her bed, with Mrs. Rubelle for  nurse. No other living creatures but my wife, myself, and Percival were in the  house. With all the chances thus in our favour I confronted the next emergency,  and played the second move in the game.  The object of the second move was to induce Lady Glyde to leave Blackwater  unaccompanied by her sister. Unless we could persuade her that Marian had gone  on to Cumberland first, there was no chance of removing her, of her own free  will, from the house. To produce this necessary operation in her mind, we  concealed our interesting invalid in one of the uninhabited bedrooms at  Blackwater. At the dead of night Madame Fosco, Madame Rubelle, and myself  (Percival not being cool enough to be trusted) accomplished the concealment.  The scene was picturesque, mysterious, dramatic in the highest degree. By my  directions the bed had been made, in the morning, on a strong movable framework  of wood. We had only to lift the framework gently at the head and foot, and to  transport our patient where we pleased, without disturbing herself or her bed.  No chemical assistance was needed or used in this case. Our interesting Marian  lay in the deep repose of convalescence. We placed the candles and opened the  doors beforehand. I, in right of my great personal strength, took the head of  the framework—my wife and Madame Rubelle took the foot. I bore my share of  that inestimably precious burden with a manly tenderness, with a fatherly care.  Where is the modern Rembrandt who could depict our midnight procession? Alas  for the Arts! alas for this most pictorial of subjects! The modern Rembrandt is  nowhere to be found.  The next morning my wife and I started for London, leaving Marian secluded, in  the uninhabited middle of the house, under care of Madame Rubelle, who kindly  consented to imprison herself with her patient for two or three days. Before  taking our departure I gave Percival Mr. Fairlie's letter of invitation to his  niece (instructing her to sleep on the journey to Cumberland at her aunt's  house), with directions to show it to Lady Glyde on hearing from me. I also  obtained from him the address of the Asylum in which Anne Catherick had been  confined, and a letter to the proprietor, announcing to that gentleman the  return of his runaway patient to medical care.  I had arranged, at my last visit to the metropolis, to have our modest domestic  establishment ready to receive us when we arrived in London by the early train.  In consequence of this wise precaution, we were enabled that same day to play  the third move in the game—the getting possession of Anne Catherick.  Dates are of importance here. I combine in myself the opposite characteristics  of a Man of Sentiment and a Man of Business. I have all the dates at my  fingers' ends.  On Wednesday, the 24th of July 1850, I sent my wife in a cab to clear Mrs.  Clements out of the way, in the first place. A supposed message from Lady Glyde  in London was sufficient to obtain this result. Mrs. Clements was taken away in  the cab, and was left in the cab, while my wife (on pretence of purchasing  something at a shop) gave her the slip, and returned to receive her expected  visitor at our house in St. John's Wood. It is hardly necessary to add that the  visitor had been described to the servants as "Lady Glyde."  In the meanwhile I had followed in another cab, with a note for Anne Catherick,  merely mentioning that Lady Glyde intended to keep Mrs. Clements to spend the  day with her, and that she was to join them under care of the good gentleman  waiting outside, who had already saved her from discovery in Hampshire by Sir  Percival. The "good gentleman" sent in this note by a street boy, and paused  for results a door or two farther on. At the moment when Anne appeared at the  house door and closed it this excellent man had the cab door open ready for  her, absorbed her into the vehicle, and drove off.  (Pass me, here, one exclamation in parenthesis. How interesting this is!)  On the way to Forest Road my companion showed no fear. I can be paternal—no  man more so—when I please, and I was intensely paternal on this occasion.  What titles I had to her confidence! I had compounded the medicine which had  done her good—I had warned her of her danger from Sir Percival. Perhaps I  trusted too implicitly to these titles—perhaps I underrated the keenness of  the lower instincts in persons of weak intellect—it is certain that I  neglected to prepare her sufficiently for a disappointment on entering my  house. When I took her into the drawing-room—when she saw no one present but  Madame Fosco, who was a stranger to her—she exhibited the most violent  agitation; if she had scented danger in the air, as a dog scents the presence  of some creature unseen, her alarm could not have displayed itself more  suddenly and more causelessly. I interposed in vain. The fear from which she  was suffering I might have soothed, but the serious heart-disease, under which  she laboured, was beyond the reach of all moral palliatives. To my unspeakable  horror she was seized with convulsions—a shock to the system, in her  condition, which might have laid her dead at any moment at our feet.  The nearest doctor was sent for, and was told that "Lady Glyde" required his  immediate services. To my infinite relief, he was a capable man. I represented  my visitor to him as a person of weak intellect, and subject to delusions, and  I arranged that no nurse but my wife should watch in the sick-room. The unhappy  woman was too ill, however, to cause any anxiety about what she might say. The  one dread which now oppressed me was the dread that the false Lady Glyde might  die before the true Lady Glyde arrived in London.  I had written a note in the morning to Madame Rubelle, telling her to join me  at her husband's house on the evening of Friday the 26th, with another note to  Percival, warning him to show his wife her uncle's letter of invitation, to  assert that Marian had gone on before her, and to despatch her to town by the  midday train, on the 26th, also. On reflection I had felt the necessity, in  Anne Catherick's state of health, of precipitating events, and of having Lady  Glyde at my disposal earlier than I had originally contemplated. What fresh  directions, in the terrible uncertainty of my position, could I now issue? I  could do nothing but trust to chance and the doctor. My emotions expressed  themselves in pathetic apostrophes, which I was just self-possessed enough to  couple, in the hearing of other people, with the name of "Lady Glyde." In all  other respects Fosco, on that memorable day, was Fosco shrouded in total  eclipse.  She passed a bad night, she awoke worn out, but later in the day she revived  amazingly. My elastic spirits revived with her. I could receive no answers from  Percival and Madame Rubelle till the morning of the next day, the 26th. In  anticipation of their following my directions, which, accident apart, I knew  they would do, I went to secure a fly to fetch Lady Glyde from the railway,  directing it to be at my house on the 26th, at two o'clock. After seeing the  order entered in the book, I went on to arrange matters with Monsieur Rubelle.  I also procured the services of two gentlemen who could furnish me with the  necessary certificates of lunacy. One of them I knew personally—the other was  known to Monsieur Rubelle. Both were men whose vigorous minds soared superior  to narrow scruples—both were labouring under temporary embarrassments—both  believed in ME.  It was past five o'clock in the afternoon before I returned from the  performance of these duties. When I got back Anne Catherick was dead. Dead on  the 25th, and Lady Glyde was not to arrive in London till the 26th!  I was stunned. Meditate on that. Fosco stunned!  It was too late to retrace our steps. Before my return the doctor had  officiously undertaken to save me all trouble by registering the death, on the  date when it happened, with his own hand. My grand scheme, unassailable  hitherto, had its weak place now—no efforts on my part could alter the fatal  event of the 25th. I turned manfully to the future. Percival's interests and  mine being still at stake, nothing was left but to play the game through to the  end. I recalled my impenetrable calm—and played it.  On the morning of the 26th Percival's letter reached me, announcing his wife's  arrival by the midday train. Madame Rubelle also wrote to say she would follow  in the evening. I started in the fly, leaving the false Lady Glyde dead in the  house, to receive the true Lady Glyde on her arrival by the railway at three  o'clock. Hidden under the seat of the carriage, I carried with me all the  clothes Anne Catherick had worn on coming into my house—they were destined to  assist the resurrection of the woman who was dead in the person of the woman  who was living. What a situation! I suggest it to the rising romance writers of  England. I offer it, as totally new, to the worn-out dramatists of France.  Lady Glyde was at the station. There was great crowding and confusion, and more  delay than I liked (in case any of her friends had happened to be on the spot),  in reclaiming her luggage. Her first questions, as we drove off, implored me to  tell her news of her sister. I invented news of the most pacifying kind,  assuring her that she was about to see her sister at my house. My house, on  this occasion only, was in the neighbourhood of Leicester Square, and was in  the occupation of Monsieur Rubelle, who received us in the hall.  I took my visitor upstairs into a back room, the two medical gentlemen being  there in waiting on the floor beneath to see the patient, and to give me their  certificates. After quieting Lady Glyde by the necessary assurances about her  sister, I introduced my friends separately to her presence. They performed the  formalities of the occasion briefly, intelligently, conscientiously. I entered  the room again as soon as they had left it, and at once precipitated events by  a reference of the alarming kind to "Miss Halcombe's" state of health.  Results followed as I had anticipated. Lady Glyde became frightened, and turned  faint. For the second time, and the last, I called Science to my assistance. A  medicated glass of water and a medicated bottle of smelling-salts relieved her  of all further embarrassment and alarm. Additional applications later in the  evening procured her the inestimable blessing of a good night's rest. Madame  Rubelle arrived in time to preside at Lady Glyde's toilet. Her own clothes were  taken away from her at night, and Anne Catherick's were put on her in the  morning, with the strictest regard to propriety, by the matronly hands of the  good Rubelle. Throughout the day I kept our patient in a state of  partially-suspended consciousness, until the dexterous assistance of my medical  friends enabled me to procure the necessary order rather earlier than I had  ventured to hope. That evening (the evening of the 27th) Madame Rubelle and I  took our revived "Anne Catherick" to the Asylum. She was received with great  surprise, but without suspicion, thanks to the order and certificates, to  Percival's letter, to the likeness, to the clothes, and to the patient's own  confused mental condition at the time. I returned at once to assist Madame  Fosco in the preparations for the burial of the False "Lady Glyde," having the  clothes and luggage of the true "Lady Glyde" in my possession. They were  afterwards sent to Cumberland by the conveyance which was used for the funeral.  I attended the funeral, with becoming dignity, attired in the deepest mourning.   My narrative of these remarkable events, written under equally remarkable  circumstances, closes here. The minor precautions which I observed in  communicating with Limmeridge House are already known, so is the magnificent  success of my enterprise, so are the solid pecuniary results which followed it.  I have to assert, with the whole force of my conviction, that the one weak  place in my scheme would never have been found out if the one weak place in my  heart had not been discovered first. Nothing but my fatal admiration for Marian  restrained me from stepping in to my own rescue when she effected her sister's  escape. I ran the risk, and trusted in the complete destruction of Lady Glyde's  identity. If either Marian or Mr. Hartright attempted to assert that identity,  they would publicly expose themselves to the imputation of sustaining a rank  deception, they would be distrusted and discredited accordingly, and they would  therefore be powerless to place my interests or Percival's secret in jeopardy.  I committed one error in trusting myself to such a blindfold calculation of  chances as this. I committed another when Percival had paid the penalty of his  own obstinacy and violence, by granting Lady Glyde a second reprieve from the  mad-house, and allowing Mr. Hartright a second chance of escaping me. In brief,  Fosco, at this serious crisis, was untrue to himself. Deplorable and  uncharacteristic fault! Behold the cause, in my heart—behold, in the image of  Marian Halcombe, the first and last weakness of Fosco's life!  At the ripe age of sixty, I make this unparalleled confession. Youths! I invoke  your sympathy. Maidens! I claim your tears.  A word more, and the attention of the reader (concentrated breathlessly on  myself) shall be released.  My own mental insight informs me that three inevitable questions will be asked  here by persons of inquiring minds. They shall be stated—they shall be  answered.  First question. What is the secret of Madame Fosco's unhesitating devotion of  herself to the fulfilment of my boldest wishes, to the furtherance of my  deepest plans? I might answer this by simply referring to my own character, and  by asking, in my turn, Where, in the history of the world, has a man of my  order ever been found without a woman in the background self-immolated on the  altar of his life? But I remember that I am writing in England, I remember that  I was married in England, and I ask if a woman's marriage obligations in this  country provide for her private opinion of her husband's principles? No! They  charge her unreservedly to love, honour, and obey him. That is exactly what my  wife has done. I stand here on a supreme moral elevation, and I loftily assert  her accurate performance of her conjugal duties. Silence, Calumny! Your  sympathy, Wives of England, for Madame Fosco!  Second question. If Anne Catherick had not died when she did, what should I  have done? I should, in that case, have assisted worn-out Nature in finding  permanent repose. I should have opened the doors of the Prison of Life, and  have extended to the captive (incurably afflicted in mind and body both) a  happy release.  Third question. On a calm revision of all the circumstances—Is my conduct  worthy of any serious blame? Most emphatically, No! Have I not carefully  avoided exposing myself to the odium of committing unnecessary crime? With my  vast resources in chemistry, I might have taken Lady Glyde's life. At immense  personal sacrifice I followed the dictates of my own ingenuity, my own  humanity, my own caution, and took her identity instead. Judge me by what I  might have done. How comparatively innocent! how indirectly virtuous I appear  in what I really did!  I announced on beginning it that this narrative would be a remarkable document.  It has entirely answered my expectations. Receive these fervid lines—my last  legacy to the country I leave for ever. They are worthy of the occasion, and  worthy of   FOSCO.    THE STORY CONCLUDED BY WALTER HARTRIGHT
