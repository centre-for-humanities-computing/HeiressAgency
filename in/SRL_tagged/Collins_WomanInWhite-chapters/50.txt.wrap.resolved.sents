 Two more events remain to be added to the chain before the chain reaches fairly from  the outset of the story to the close.
While our new sense of freedom from the long oppression of the past was still  strange to our, I was sent for by the friend who had given me my first  employment in wood engraving, to receive from the friend who had given me my first  employment in wood engraving a fresh testimony of the friend who had given me my first  employment in wood engraving  regard for my welfare.
the friend who had given me my first  employment in wood engraving had been commissioned by the friend who had given me my first  employment in wood engraving employers to go to  Paris, and to examine for his employers a fresh discovery in the practical application  of the friend who had given me my first  employment in wood engraving Art, the merits of which his employers were anxious to ascertain.
the friend who had given me my first  employment in wood engraving own  engagements had not allowed the friend who had given me my first  employment in wood engraving leisure time to undertake the errand, and the friend who had given me my first  employment in wood engraving  had most kindly suggested that it should be transferred to me.
I could have no  hesitation in thankfully accepting the offer, for if I acquitted me of my  commission as I hoped I should, the result would be a permanent engagement on  the illustrated newspaper, to which I was now only occasionally attached.
I received my instructions and packed up for the journey the next day.
On  leaving Laura once more (under what changed circumstances!)
in Laura sister's  care, a serious consideration recurred to me, which had more than once crossed  my wife's mind, as well as my own, already—I mean the consideration of  Marian's future.
Had we any right to let we selfish affection accept the  devotion of all that generous life?
Was it not we duty, we best expression of  gratitude, to forget we, and to think only of HER?
I tried to say this  when we were alone for a moment, before I went away.
HER took my hand, and  silenced me at the first words.
"After all that we three have suffered together," HER said "there can be no  parting between we till the last parting of all.
My heart and my happiness,  Walter, are with Laura and you.
Wait a little till there are children's voices  at your fireside.
I will teach children's voices   to speak for me in children's voices   language, and the  first lesson children's voices   say to children's voices   father and mother shall be—we can't spare we  aunt!"
My journey to Paris was not undertaken alone.
At the eleventh hour Pesca  decided that Pesca   would accompany me.
Pesca   had not recovered Pesca   customary  cheerfulness since the night at the Opera, and Pesca   determined to try what a  week's holiday would do to raise Pesca   spirits.
I performed the errand entrusted to me, and drew out the necessary report, on  the fourth day from we arrival in Paris.
The fifth day I arranged to devote to  sight-seeing and amusements in Pesca's company.
we hotel had been too full to accommodate us both on the same floor.
My room  was on the second story, and Pesca's was above me, on the third.
On the morning  of The fifth day I went upstairs to see if the Professor was ready to go out.
Just before I reached the landing I saw the Professor door opened from the inside—a  long, delicate, nervous hand (not my friend's hand certainly) held his door ajar.
At  the same time I heard Pesca's voice saying eagerly, in low tones, and in the Professor  own language—"I remember the name, but I don't know the man.
You saw at the  Opera the man was so changed that I could not recognise the man.
I will forward the  report—I can do no more."
"No more need be done," answered the second voice.
his door opened wide, and the light-haired man with the scar on the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek cheek—the  man I had seen following Count Fosco's cab a week before—came out.
the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek bowed  as I drew aside to let the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek pass—the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek face was fearfully pale—and the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek held  fast by the banisters as the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek descended the stairs.
I pushed open his door and entered Pesca's room.
the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek was crouched up, in the  strangest manner, in a corner of the sofa.
the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek seemed to shrink from the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek when I  approached the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek.
"Am I disturbing you?"
I asked.
"I did not know you had a friend with you till  I saw the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek come out."
"No friend," said Pesca eagerly.
"I see the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek to-day for the first time and the  last."
"I am afraid the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek has brought you bad news?"
"Horrible news, Walter!
Let us go back to London—I don't want to stop  here—I am sorry I ever came.
The misfortunes of my youth are very hard upon  me," the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek said, turning his face to the wall, "very hard upon the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek in my later  time.
I try to forget them—and them will not forget ME!"
"us can't return, I am afraid, before the afternoon," I replied.
"Would you  like to come out with the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek in the meantime?"
"No, a friend with you, I will wait here.
But let us go back to-day—pray let us go  back."
I left the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek with the assurance that the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek should leave Paris the afternoon.
us had  arranged the evening before to ascend the Cathedral of Notre Dame, with Victor  Hugo's noble romance for us guide.
There was nothing in the French capital  that I was more anxious to see, and I departed by the light-haired man with the scar on his cheek for the church.
Approaching Notre Dame by the river-side, I passed on my way the terrible  dead-house of Paris—the Morgue.
A great crowd clamoured and heaved round the  door.
There was evidently something inside which excited the popular curiosity,  and fed the popular appetite for horror.
I should have walked on to the church if the conversation of two men and a  woman on the outskirts of A great crowd had not caught my ear.
two men and a  woman on the outskirts of the crowd had just come  out from seeing the sight in the Morgue, and the account two men and a  woman on the outskirts of the crowd were giving of  the dead body to two men and a  woman on the outskirts of the crowd neighbours described it as the corpse of a man—a man  of immense size, with a strange mark on a man left arm.
The moment those words reached me I stopped and took my place with the crowd  going in.
Some dim foreshadowing of the truth had crossed my mind when I heard  Pesca's voice through the open door, and when I saw the stranger's face as he  passed me on the stairs of the hotel.
Now the truth was revealed to  me—revealed in the chance words that had just reached my ears.
Other  vengeance than mine had followed that fated man from the theatre to Other  vengeance than mine own  door—from Other  vengeance than mine own door to Other  vengeance than mine refuge in Paris.
Other vengeance than mine had  called Other  vengeance than mine to the day of reckoning, and had exacted from Other  vengeance than mine the penalty of Other  vengeance than mine  life.
The moment when I had pointed Other  vengeance than mine out to Pesca at the theatre in the  hearing of that stranger by our side, who was looking for Other  vengeance than mine too—was the  moment that sealed Other  vengeance than mine doom.
I remembered the struggle in my own heart, when Other  vengeance than mine  and I stood face to face—the struggle before I could let Other  vengeance than mine escape me—and  shuddered as I recalled it.
Slowly, inch by inch, I pressed in with the crowd, moving nearer and nearer to  the great glass screen that parts the dead from the living at the  Morgue—nearer and nearer, till I was close behind the front row of  spectators, and could look in.
There Other  vengeance than mine lay, unowned, unknown, exposed to the flippant curiosity of a French  mob!
There was the dreadful end of that long life of degraded ability and  heartless crime!
Hushed in the sublime repose of death, the broad, firm,  massive face and head fronted us so grandly that the chattering Frenchwomen  about Other  vengeance than mine lifted firm,   hands in admiration, and cried in shrill chorus, "Ah,  what a handsome man!"
The wound that had killed him had been struck with a  knife or dagger exactly over him heart.
No other traces of violence appeared  about the body except on the left arm, and there, exactly in the place where I  had seen the brand on Pesca's arm, were two deep cuts in the shape of the  letter T, which entirely obliterated the mark of the Brotherhood.
His clothes,  hung above His, showed that His had been His conscious of His danger—they  were clothes that had disguised His as a French artisan.
For a few moments, but  not for longer, I forced Other  vengeance than mine to see these things through the glass screen.
I  can write of these things at no greater length, for I saw no more.
The few facts in connection with His death which I subsequently ascertained  (partly from Pesca and partly from other sources), may be stated here before  the subject is dismissed from these pages.
His body was taken out of the Seine in the disguise which I have described,  nothing being found on His which revealed His name, His rank, or His place of  abode.
The hand that struck His was never traced, and the circumstances under  which His was killed were never discovered.
I leave others to draw others own  conclusions in reference to the secret of the assassination as I have drawn  mine.
When I have intimated that the foreigner with the scar was a member of  the Brotherhood (admitted in Italy after Pesca's departure from his native  country), and when I have further added that the two cuts, in the form of a T,  on the left arm of the dead man, signified the Italian word "Traditore," and  showed that justice had been done by the Brotherhood on a traitor, I have  contributed all that I know towards elucidating the mystery of Count Fosco's  death.
His body was identified the day after I had seen His body by means of an anonymous  letter addressed to his wife.
his was buried by Count Fosco's   in the cemetery of  Pere la Chaise.
Fresh funeral wreaths continue to this day to be hung on the  ornamental bronze railings round the tomb by The hand that struck him.
the Countess lives  in the strictest retirement at Versailles.
Not long since the Countess published a  biography of the Countess deceased husband.
The work throws no light whatever on the  name that was really her deceased husband own or on the secret history of her deceased husband life—it is  almost entirely devoted to the praise of her deceased husband domestic virtues, the assertion of  her deceased husband rare abilities, and the enumeration of the honours conferred on her deceased husband.
The  circumstances attending her deceased husband are very briefly noticed, and are summed up  on the last page in this sentence—"His life was one long assertion of the  rights of the aristocracy and the sacred principles of Order, and her deceased husband died a  martyr to her deceased husband cause."
