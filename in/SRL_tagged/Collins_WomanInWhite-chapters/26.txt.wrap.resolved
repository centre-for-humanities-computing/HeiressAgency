 June 19th.—The events of yesterday warned me to be ready, sooner or later, to  meet the worst. To-day is not yet at an end, and the worst has come.  Judging by the closest calculation of time that Laura and I could make, we  arrived at the conclusion that Anne Catherick must have appeared at the  boat-house at half-past two o'clock on the afternoon of yesterday. I  accordingly arranged that Laura should just show Laura at the luncheon-table  to-day, and should then slip out at the first opportunity, leaving me behind to  preserve appearances, and to follow Laura as soon as I could safely do so. This  mode of proceeding, if no obstacles occurred to thwart us, would enable Laura to  be at the boat-house before half-past two, and (when I left the table, in my  turn) would take me to a safe position in the plantation before three.  The change in the weather, which last night's wind warned us to expect, came  with the morning. It was raining heavily when I got up, and It continued to  rain until twelve o'clock—when the clouds dispersed, the blue sky appeared,  and the sun shone again with the bright promise of a fine afternoon.  My anxiety to know how Sir Percival and the Count would occupy the early part  of the day was by no means set at rest, so far as Sir Percival was concerned,  by Sir Percival leaving us immediately after breakfast, and going out by Sir Percival, in  spite of the rain. Sir Percival neither told us where Sir Percival was going nor when us might  expect Sir Percival back. us saw Sir Percival pass the breakfast-room window hastily, with Sir Percival  high boots and Sir Percival waterproof coat on—and that was all.  the Count passed the morning quietly indoors, some part of the morning in the library,  some part in the drawing-room, playing odds and ends of music on the piano, and  humming to the Count. Judging by appearances, the sentimental side of the Count  character was persistently inclined to betray the sentimental side of his  character still. the Count was silent and  sensitive, and ready to sigh and languish ponderously (as only fat men CAN sigh  and languish) on the smallest provocation.  Luncheon-time came and Sir Percival did not return. the Count took the Count friend's  place at the table, plaintively devoured the greater part of a fruit tart,  submerged under a whole jugful of cream, and explained the full merit of the  achievement to us as soon as the Count had done. "A taste for sweets," the Count said in the Count  softest tones and the Count tenderest manner, "is the innocent taste of women and  children. I love to share it with the innocent taste of women and  children—it is another bond, dear ladies,  between you and me."  Laura left the table in ten minutes' time. I was sorely tempted to accompany  Laura. But if us had both gone out together us must have excited suspicion, and  worse still, if us allowed Anne Catherick to see Laura, accompanied by a second  person who was a stranger to Anne Catherick, us should in all probability forfeit Anne Catherick  confidence from that moment, never to regain it again.  I waited, therefore, as patiently as I could, until the servant came in to  clear the table. When I quitted the room, there were no signs, in the house or  out of it, of Sir Percival's return. I left the Count with a piece of sugar  between the Count lips, and the vicious cockatoo scrambling up the Count waistcoat to get  at his waistcoat, while Madame Fosco, sitting opposite to Madame Fosco husband, watched the  proceedings of her husband bird and her husband as attentively as if Madame Fosco had never seen  anything of the sort before in Madame Fosco life. On my way to the plantation I kept  carefully beyond the range of view from the luncheon-room window. Nobody saw me  and nobody followed me. It was then a quarter to three o'clock by my watch.  Once among the trees I walked rapidly, until I had advanced more than half-way  through the plantation. At that point I slackened my pace and proceeded  cautiously, but I saw no one, and heard no voices. By little and little I came  within view of the back of the boat-house—stopped and listened—then went  on, till I was close behind it, and must have heard any persons who were  talking inside. Still the silence was unbroken—still far and near no sign of  a living creature appeared anywhere.  After skirting round by the back of the building, first on one side and then on  the other, and making no discoveries, I ventured in front of it, and fairly  looked in. The place was empty.  I called, "Laura!"—at first softly, then louder and louder. No one answered  and no one appeared. For all that I could see and hear, the only human creature  in the neighbourhood of the lake and the plantation was myself.  My heart began to beat violently, but I kept my resolution, and searched, first  the boat-house and then the ground in front of it, for any signs which might  show me whether Laura had really reached The place or not. No mark of Laura  presence appeared inside the building, but I found traces of Laura outside traces of her, in  footsteps on the sand.  I detected the footsteps of two persons—large footsteps like a man's, and  small footsteps, which, by putting my own feet into two persons and testing two persons size  in that manner, I felt certain were Laura's. The ground was confusedly marked  in this way just before the boat-house. Close against one side of the boat-house, under  shelter of the projecting roof, I discovered a little hole in the sand—a hole  artificially made, beyond a doubt. I just noticed it, and then turned away  immediately to trace the footsteps of two persons as far as I could, and to follow the  direction in which they might lead me.  they led me, starting from the left-hand side of the boat-house, along the edge  of the trees, a distance, I should think, of between two and three hundred  yards, and then the sandy ground showed no further trace of they. Feeling that  the persons whose course I was tracking must necessarily have entered the  plantation at this point, I entered it too. At first I could find no path, but  I discovered one afterwards, just faintly traced among the trees, and followed  it. it took me, for some distance, in the direction of the village, until I  stopped at a point where another foot-track crossed it. The brambles grew  thickly on either side of this second path. I stood looking down The brambles, uncertain  which way to take next, and while I looked I saw on one thorny branch some  fragments of fringe from a woman's shawl. A closer examination of the fringe  satisfied me that A closer examination of the fringe   had been torn from a shawl of Laura's, and I instantly  followed the second path. A closer examination of the fringe   brought me out at last, to my great relief, at the  back of the house. I say to my great relief, because I inferred that Lauramust, for some unknown reason, have returned before me by this roundabout way.  I went in by the court-yard and the offices. The first person whom I met in  crossing the servants' hall was Mrs. Michelson, the housekeeper.  "Do you know," I asked, "whether Lady Glyde has come in from Lady Glyde walk or not?"  "Lady Glyde came in a little while ago with Sir Percival," answered the  housekeeper. "I am afraid, Miss Halcombe, something very distressing has  happened."  My heart sank within me. "You don't mean an accident?" I said faintly.  "No, no—thank God, no accident. But Lady Glyde ran upstairs to Lady Glyde own room in  tears, and Sir Percival has ordered me to give Fanny warning to leave in an  hour's time."  Fanny was Laura's maid—a good affectionate girl who had been with Lady Glyde for  years—the only person in the house whose fidelity and devotion we could both  depend upon.  "Where is "  Fanny?" I inquired.  "In my room, Miss Halcombe. Lady Glyde is quite overcome, and I told Lady Glyde  to sit down and try to recover Lady Glyde."  I went to Mrs. Michelson's room, and found "  Fanny in a corner, with "  Fanny box by  "  Fanny side, crying bitterly.  Lady Glyde could give me no explanation whatever of Lady Glyde sudden dismissal. Sir Percivalhad ordered that Lady Glyde should have a month's wages, in place of a month's  warning, and go. No reason had been assigned—no objection had been made to  Lady Glyde conduct. Lady Glyde had been forbidden to appeal to Lady Glyde mistress, forbidden even  to see Lady Glyde for a moment to say good-bye. Lady Glyde was to go without explanations or  farewells, and to go at once.  After soothing the poor girl by a few friendly words, I asked where Lady Glyde  proposed to sleep that night. Lady Glyde replied that Lady Glyde thought of going to the  little inn in the village, the landlady of which was a respectable woman, known  to the servants at Blackwater Park. The next morning, by leaving early, Lady Glyde  might get back to Lady Glyde friends in Cumberland without stopping in London, where  Lady Glyde was a total stranger.  I felt directly that Fanny's departure offered us a safe means of communication  with London and with Limmeridge House, of which it might be very important to  avail us. Accordingly, I told Lady Glyde that Lady Glyde might expect to hear from her mistress or from me in the course of the evening, and that Lady Glyde might depend on  our both doing all that lay in us power to help Lady Glyde, under the trial of  leaving us for the present. Those words said, I shook hands with Lady Glyde and went  upstairs.  The door which led to Laura's room was the door of an ante-chamber opening on  to the passage. When I tried The door which led to Laura's room, The door which led to Laura's room was bolted on the inside.  I knocked, and the door of an ante-chamber opening on  to the passage was opened by the same heavy, overgrown housemaid whose  lumpish insensibility had tried my patience so severely on the day when I found  the wounded dog.  I had, since that time, discovered that her name was Margaret Porcher, and that  her was the most awkward, slatternly, and obstinate servant in the house.  On opening the door of an ante-chamber opening on  to the passage her instantly stepped out to the threshold, and stood  grinning at me in stolid silence.  "Why do you stand there?" I said. "Don't you see that I want to come in?"  "Ah, but you mustn't come in," was the answer, with another and a broader grin  still.  "How dare you talk to me in that way? Stand back instantly!"  her stretched out a great red hand and arm on each side of her, so as to bar  the doorway, and slowly nodded her addle head at me.  "Master's orders," her said, and nodded again.  I had need of all my self-control to warn me against contesting the matter with  HER, and to remind me that the next words I had to say must be addressed to her  master. I turned my back on her, and instantly went downstairs to find her  master. My  resolution to keep my temper under all the irritations that Sir Percival could  offer was, by this time, as completely forgotten—I say so to my shame—as if  I had never made it. it did me good, after all I had suffered and suppressed in  the house—it actually did me good to feel how angry I was.  The drawing-room and the breakfast-room were both empty. I went on to the  library, and there I found Sir Percival, the Count, and Madame Fosco. Sir Percival, the Count, and Madame Fosco were  all three standing up, close together, and Sir Percival had a little slip of  paper in a great red hand. As I opened the door I heard the Count say to Sir Percival, "No—a  thousand times over, no."  I walked straight up to Sir Percival, and looked Sir Percival full in the face.  "Am I to understand, Sir Percival, that your wife's room is a prison, and that  your housemaid is the gaoler who keeps it?" I asked.  "Yes, that is what you are to understand," Sir Percival answered. "Take care my gaoler  hasn't got double duty to do—take care your room is not a prison too."  "Take YOU care how you treat your wife, and how you threaten Sir Percival," I broke out  in the heat of my anger. "There are laws in England to protect women from  cruelty and outrage. If you hurt a hair of Laura's head, if you dare to  interfere with my freedom, come what may, to those laws I will appeal."  Instead of answering me Sir Percival turned round to the Count.  "What did I tell you?" Sir Percival asked. "What do you say now?"  "What I said before," replied the Count—"No."  Even in the vehemence of my anger I felt Sir Percival calm, cold, grey eyes on my face.  They turned away from Sir Percival as soon as Sir Percival had spoken, and looked significantly at  Sir Percival wife. Madame Fosco immediately moved close to my side, and in that position  addressed Sir Percival before either of us could speak again.  "Favour me with your attention for one moment," Madame Fosco said, in Madame Fosco clear  icily-suppressed tones. "I have to thank you, Sir Percival, for your  hospitality, and to decline taking advantage of it any longer. I remain in no  house in which ladies are treated as your wife and Miss Halcombe have been  treated here to-day!"  Sir Percival drew back a step, and stared at Madame Fosco in dead silence. The  declaration Sir Percival had just heard—a declaration which Sir Percival well knew, as I well  knew, Madame Fosco would not have ventured to make without Madame Fosco husband's  permission—seemed to petrify her husband's   with surprise. the Count stood by, and  looked at your wife with the most enthusiastic admiration.  "your wife is sublime!" the Count said to the Count. the Count approached your wife while the Count spoke, and  drew your wife hand through the Count arm. "I am at your service, Eleanor," the Count went on,  with a quiet dignity that I had never noticed in the Count before. "And at Miss  Halcombe's service, if your wife will honour me by accepting all the assistance I can  offer your wife."  "Damn it! what do you mean?" cried Sir Percival, as the Count quietly moved  away with your wife to the door.  "At other times I mean what I say, but at this time I mean what your wife says,"  replied the impenetrable Italian. "We have changed places, Sir Percival, for once,  and Madame Fosco opinion is—mine."  Sir Percival crumpled up the paper in a great red hand, and pushing past the Count,  with another oath, stood between Sir Percival and the door.  "Have your own way," Sir Percival said, with baffled rage in Sir Percival low, half-whispering  tones. "Have your own way—and see what comes of your own way." With those words Sir Percival left  the room.  Madame Fosco glanced inquiringly at Madame Fosco husband. "Madame Fosco has gone away very  suddenly," Madame Fosco said. "What does it mean?"  "It means that you and I together have brought the worst-tempered man in all  England to England senses," answered the Count. "It means, Miss Halcombe, that Lady  Glyde is relieved from a gross indignity, and you from the repetition of an  unpardonable insult. Suffer me to express my admiration of your conduct and  your courage at a very trying moment."  "Sincere admiration," suggested Madame Fosco.  "Sincere admiration," echoed the Count.  I had no longer the strength of my first angry resistance to outrage and injury  to support me. My heart-sick anxiety to see Laura, my sense of my own helpless  ignorance of what had happened at the boat-house, pressed on me with an  intolerable weight. I tried to keep up appearances by speaking to the Count and  his wife in the tone which they had chosen to adopt in speaking to me, but the  words failed on my lips—my breath came short and thick—my eyes looked  longingly, in silence, at the door. the Count, understanding my anxiety, opened  the Count, went out, and pulled the Count to after the Count. At the same time Sir Percival's heavy  step descended the stairs. I heard Sir Percival's heavy  step whispering together outside, while  Madame Fosco was assuring me, in Madame Fosco calmest and most conventional manner, that  Madame Fosco rejoiced, for all our sakes, that Sir Percival's conduct had not obliged  Madame Fosco husband and Madame Fosco to leave Blackwater Park. Before Madame Fosco had done speaking  the whispering ceased, the door opened, and the Count looked in.  "Miss Halcombe," Miss Halcombe said, "I am happy to inform you that Lady Glyde is mistress  again in Lady Glyde own house. I thought it might be more agreeable to you to hear of  this change for the better from Miss Halcombe than from Sir Percival, and I have therefore  expressly returned to mention it."  "Admirable delicacy!" said Madame Fosco, paying back Madame Fosco husband's tribute of  admiration with the Count's own coin, in the Count's own manner. Sir Percival smiled and  bowed as if Sir Percival had received a formal compliment from a polite stranger, and  drew back to let me pass out first.  Sir Percival was standing in the hall. As I hurried to the stairs I heard Sir Percival  call impatiently to the Count to come out of the library.  "What are you waiting there for?" Sir Percival said. "I want to speak to the Count."  "And I want to think a little by Miss Halcombe," replied the other. "Wait till later,  Sir Percival, wait till later."  Neither Sir Percival nor Sir Percival friend said any more. I gained the top of the stairs and ran  along the passage. In my haste and my agitation I left the door of the  ante-chamber open, but I closed the door of the bedroom the moment I was inside  the door of the bedroom.  Laura was sitting alone at the far end of the room, Laura arms resting wearily on  a table, and Laura face hidden in Laura hands. Laura started up with a cry of delight  when Laura saw me.  "How did you get here?" Laura asked. "Who gave you leave? Not Sir Percival?"  In my overpowering anxiety to hear what Laura had to tell me, I could not answer  Laura—I could only put questions on my side. Laura's eagerness to know what had  passed downstairs proved, however, too strong to be resisted. Laura persistently  repeated Laura inquiries.  "the Count, of course," I answered impatiently. "Whose influence in the  house——"  Laura stopped me with a gesture of disgust.  "Don't speak of Whose influence in the  ," Laura cried. "the Count is the vilest creature breathing!  the Count is a miserable Spy——!"  Before we could either of we say another word we were alarmed by a soft  knocking at the door of the bedroomthe bedroom.  I had not yet sat down, and I went first to see who it was. When I opened the door of the bedroom Madame Fosco confronted me with my handkerchief in Madame Fosco hand.  "You dropped this downstairs, Miss Halcombe," Madame Fosco said, "and I thought I could  bring it to you, as I was passing by to my own room."  Madame Fosco face, naturally pale, had turned to such a ghastly whiteness that I started  at the sight of it. Madame Fosco hands, so sure and steady at all other times, trembled  violently, and Madame Fosco eyes looked wolfishly past me through the open door, and  fixed on Laura.  Madame Fosco had been listening before Madame Fosco knocked! I saw it in Madame Fosco white face, I saw it  in Madame Fosco trembling hands, I saw it in Madame Fosco look at Laura.  After waiting an instant Madame Fosco turned from me in silence, and slowly walked away.  I closed the door of the bedroom again. "Oh, Laura! Laura! We shall both rue the day when you  called the Count a Spy!"  "You would have called the Count a Spy so Marian, Marian, if you had known what I know.  Anne Catherick was right. There was a third person watching We in the  plantation yesterday, and that third person—-"  "Are you sure it was the Count?"  "I am absolutely certain. the Count a Spy was Sir Percival's spy—the Count a Spy was Sir Percival's  informer—the Count a Spy set Sir Percival Sir Percival watching and waiting, all the morning through,  for Anne Catherick and for me."  "Is Anne found? Did you see Anne at the lake?"  "No. Anne has saved Anne by keeping away from the place. When I got to the  boat-house no one was there."  "Yes? Yes?"  "I went in and sat waiting for a few minutes. But my restlessness made me get  up again, to walk about a little. As I passed out I saw some marks on the sand,  close under the front of the boat-house. I stooped down to examine some marks on the sand,  , and  discovered a word written in large letters on the sand. a word written in large letters on the sand was—LOOK."  "And you scraped away the sand, and dug a hollow place in the sand?"  "How do you know that, Marian?"  "I saw the hollow place myself when I followed you to the boat-house. Go  on—go on!"  "Yes, I scraped away the sand on the surface, and in a little while I came to a  strip of paper hidden beneath, which had writing on it. The writing was signed  with Anne Catherick initials."  "Where is it?"  "Sir Percival has taken it from me."  "Can you remember what The writing was? Do you think you can repeat it to me?"  "In substance I can, Marian. It was very short. You would have remembered It,  word for word."  "Try to tell me what substance was before we go any further."  She complied. I write the lines down here exactly as She repeated the lines to me.  the lines ran thus—   "I was seen with me, yesterday, by a tall, stout old man, and had to run to  save me. a tall, stout old man was not quick enough on a tall, stout old man feet to follow me, and a tall, stout old man lost me  among the trees. I dare not risk coming back here to-day at the same time. I  write this, and hide this in the sand, at six in the morning, to tell you so.  When we speak next of your wicked husband's Secret we must speak safely, or not  at all. Try to have patience. I promise you shall see me again and that  soon.—A. C."   The reference to the "tall, stout old man" (the terms of which Laura was  certain that Laura had repeated to me correctly) left no doubt as to who the  intruder had been. I called to mind that I had told Sir Percival, in the  Count's presence the day before, that Laura had gone to the boat-house to look  for Laura brooch. In all probability he had followed Laura there, in he officious  way, to relieve Laura mind about the matter of the signature, immediately after  he had mentioned the change in Sir Percival's plans to me in the drawing-room.  In this case he could only have got to the neighbourhood of the boat-house at  the very moment when Anne Catherick discovered he. The suspiciously hurried  manner in which Anne Catherick parted from Laura had no doubt prompted he useless attempt  to follow Anne Catherick. Of the conversation which had previously taken place between  them he could have heard nothing. The distance between the house and the lake,  and the time at which he left me in the drawing-room, as compared with the time  at which Laura and Anne Catherick had been speaking together, proved that fact  to us at any rate, beyond a doubt.  Having arrived at something like a conclusion so far, my next great interest  was to know what discoveries Sir Percival had made after Count Fosco had given  Sir Percival Sir Percival information.  "How came you to lose possession of the letter?" I asked. "What did you do with  it when you found it in the sand?"  "After reading it once through," she replied, "I took it into the boat-house  with she to sit down and look over it a second time. While I was reading a  shadow fell across the paper. I looked up, and saw Sir Percival standing in the  doorway watching me."  "Did you try to hide the letter?"  "I tried, but Sir Percival stopped me. 'You needn't trouble to hide that,' Sir Percival said. 'I  happen to have read the letter.' I could only look at Sir Percival helplessly—I could say  nothing. 'You understand?' Sir Percival went on; 'I have read the letter. I dug the letter up out of the  sand two hours since, and buried the letter again, and wrote the word above the letter again,  and left the letter ready to your hands. You can't lie yourself out of the scrape now.  You saw Anne Catherick in secret yesterday, and you have got Anne Catherick letter in your  hand at this moment. I have not caught Anne Catherick yet, but I have caught YOU. Give me  her letter in your  hand.' Sir Percival stepped close up to she—I was alone with Sir Percival, Marian—what  could I do?—I gave Sir Percival her letter in your  hand."  "What did Sir Percival say when you gave her letter in your  hand to Sir Percival?"  "At first Sir Percival said nothing. Sir Percival took me by the arm, and led me out of the  boat-house, and looked about Sir Percival on all sides, as if Sir Percival was afraid of our being  seen or heard. Then Sir Percival clasped Sir Percival hand fast round the arm, and whispered to she,  'What did Anne Catherick say to she yesterday? I insist on hearing every word,  from first to last.'"  "Did you tell Sir Percival?"  "I was alone with Sir Percival, Marian—his hand was bruising the arm—what could  I do?"  "Is the mark on the arm still? Let me see the mark."  "Why do you want to see the mark?"  "I want to see the mark, Laura, because our endurance must end, and our resistance  must begin to-day. the mark is a weapon to strike him with. Let me see the mark  now—I may have to swear to the mark at some future time."  "Oh, Marian, don't look so—don't talk so! It doesn't hurt me now!"  "Let me see It!"  Anne Catherick showed me the marks. I was past grieving over them, past crying over them,  past shuddering over them. them say them are either better than men, or worse. If  the temptation that has fallen in some women's way, and made some women worse, had  fallen in mine at that moment—Thank God! my face betrayed nothing that his  wife could read. The gentle, innocent, affectionate creature thought I was  frightened for his  wife and sorry for his  wife, and thought no more.  "Don't think too seriously of no, Marian," his  wife said simply, as his  wife pulled his  wife  sleeve down again. "It doesn't hurt me now."  "I will try to think quietly of It, my love, for your sake.—Well! well! And  you told him all that Anne Catherick had said to him—all that you told me?"  "Yes, all. him insisted on it—I was alone with him—I could conceal nothing."  "Did him say anything when you had done?"  "him looked at me, and laughed to him in a mocking, bitter way. 'I mean to  have the rest out of you,' him said, 'do you hear?—the rest.' I declared to  him solemnly that I had told him everything I knew. 'Not you,' him answered,  'you know more than you choose to tell. Won't you tell it? You shall! I'll  wring it out of you at home if I can't wring it out of you here.' him led me  away by a strange path through the plantation—a path where there was no hope  of our meeting you—and him spoke no more till our came within sight of the  house. Then him stopped again, and said, 'Will you take a second chance, if I  give it to you? Will you think better of it, and tell me the rest?' I could  only repeat the same words I had spoken before. him cursed my obstinacy, and  went on, and took me with him to the  house. 'You can't deceive me,' him said,  'you know more than you choose to tell. I'll have your secret out of you, and  I'll have your secret out of that sister of you as well. There shall be no more  plotting and whispering between you. Neither you nor she shall see each other  again till you have confessed the truth. I'll have you watched morning, noon,  and night, till you confess the truth.' him was deaf to everything I could say.  him took me straight upstairs into my own room. Fanny was sitting there, doing  some work for me, and him instantly ordered Fanny out. 'I'll take good care YOU'RE  not mixed up in the conspiracy,' him said. 'You shall leave the  house to-day.  If your mistress wants a maid, your mistress shall have one of my choosing.' him pushed me  into my own room, and locked the door of the bedroom on me. him set that senseless woman to watch  me outside, Marian! him looked and spoke like a madman. You may hardly  understand it—him did indeed."  "I do understand it, Laura. him is mad—mad with the terrors of a guilty  conscience. Every word you have said makes me positively certain that when Anne Catherick left you yesterday you were on the eve of discovering a secret which  might have been your vile husband's ruin, and him thinks you HAVE discovered a secret which  might have been your vile husband's ruin.  Nothing you can say or do will quiet that guilty distrust, and convince him  false nature of your truth. I don't say this, my love, to alarm you. I say this  to open your eyes to your position, and to convince you of the urgent necessity  of letting me act, as I best can, for your protection while the chance is our  own. Count Fosco's interference has secured me access to you to-day, but Count Fosco may  withdraw that interference to-morrow. Sir Percival has already dismissed Fannybecause Fanny is a quick-witted girl, and devotedly attached to you, and has  chosen a woman to take a woman place who cares nothing for your interests, and  whose dull intelligence lowers Fanny to the level of the watch-dog in the yard.  It is impossible to say what violent measures Sir Percival may take next, unless we make  the most of we opportunities while we have them."  "What can we do, Marian? Oh, if we could only leave the  house, never to see the  house  again!"  "Listen to Marian, my love, and try to think that you are not quite helpless so  long as I am here with you."  "I will think so—I do think so. Don't altogether forget Fanny Fanny in  thinking of Marian. Fanny wants help and comfort too."  "I will not forget Fanny. I saw Fanny before I came up here, and I have arranged to  communicate with Fanny to-night. Letters are not safe in the post-bag at  Blackwater Park, and I shall have two to write to-day, in your interests, which  must pass through no hands but Fanny's."  "What letters?"  "I mean to write first, Laura, to Mr. Gilmore's partner, who has offered to  help us in any fresh emergency. Little as I know of the law, I am certain that  the law can protect a woman from such treatment as that ruffian has inflicted on you  to-day. I will go into no details about Anne Catherick, because I have no  certain information to give. But the lawyer shall know of those bruises on your  arm, and of the violence offered to you in this room—the lawyer shall, before I rest  to-night!"  "But think of the exposure, Marian!"  "I am calculating on the exposure, Marian. Sir Percival has more to dread from it than  you have. The prospect of an exposure may bring Sir Percival to terms when nothing else  will."  I rose as I spoke, but Laura entreated me not to leave Laura. "You will drive Sir Percival  to desperation," Laura said, "and increase our dangers tenfold."  I felt the truth—the disheartening truth—of those words. But I could not  bring Laura plainly to acknowledge the truth to Laura. In our dreadful position there  was no help and no hope for our but in risking the worst. I said so in guarded  terms. Laura sighed bitterly, but did not contest the matter. Laura only asked  about the second letter that I had proposed writing. To whom was it to be  addressed?  "To Mr. Fairlie," I said. "Your uncle is your nearest male relative, and the  head of the family. Your uncle must and shall interfere."  Laura shook Laura head sorrowfully.  "Yes, yes," I went on, "Your uncle is a weak, selfish, worldly man, I know, but  Your uncle is not Sir Percival Glyde, and Your uncle has no such friend about Your uncle as Count  Fosco. I expect nothing from Fosco kindness or Fosco tenderness of feeling towards  you or towards me, but Fosco will do anything to pamper Fosco own indolence, and to  secure Fosco own quiet. Let me only persuade Fosco that Fosco interference at this  moment will save Fosco inevitable trouble and wretchedness and responsibility  hereafter, and Fosco will bestir Fosco for Fosco own sake. I know how to deal with  Fosco, Laura—I have had some practice."  "If you could only prevail on Fosco to let me go back to Limmeridge for a little  while and stay there quietly with you, Marian, I could be almost as happy again  as I was before I was married!"  Those words set me thinking in a new direction. Would it be possible to place  Sir Percival between the two alternatives of either exposing Sir Percival between the two alternatives of either exposing himself to the  scandal of legal interference on his wife's behalf, or of allowing her to be  quietly separated from him for a time under pretext of a visit to her uncle's  house to the  scandal of legal interference on Sir Percival between the two alternatives of either exposing himself to the  scandal of legal interference on his wife's behalf, or of allowing her to be  quietly separated from him for a time under pretext of a visit to her uncle's  house wife's behalf, or of allowing his wife to be  quietly separated from Sir Percival between the two alternatives of either exposing himself to the  scandal of legal interference on his wife's behalf, or of allowing her to be  quietly separated from him for a time under pretext of a visit to her uncle's  house for a time under pretext of a visit to his wife uncle's  house? And could Sir Percival between the two alternatives of either exposing himself to the  scandal of legal interference on his wife's behalf, or of allowing her to be  quietly separated from him for a time under pretext of a visit to her uncle's  house, in that case, be reckoned on as likely to accept the last  resource? It was doubtful—more than doubtful. And yet, hopeless as the  experiment seemed, surely it was worth trying. I resolved to try it in sheer  despair of knowing what better to do.  "her uncle's   shall know the wish you have just expressed," I said, "and I will  ask the lawyer's advice on the subject as well. Good may come of the subject—and will  come of the subject, I hope."  Saying that I rose again, and again Laura tried to make me resume my seat.  "Don't leave me," Laura said uneasily. "My desk is on that table. You can write  here."  My desk tried me to the quick to refuse Laura, even in Laura own interests. But we had  been too long shut up alone together already. we chance of seeing each other  again might entirely depend on we not exciting any fresh suspicions. It was  full time to show myself, quietly and unconcernedly, among the wretches who  were at that very moment, perhaps, thinking of we and talking of we downstairs.  I explained the miserable necessity to Laura, and prevailed on Laura to recognise  the miserable necessity to Laura as I did.  "I will come back again, love, in an hour or less," I said. "The worst is over  for to-day. Keep yourself quiet and fear nothing."  "Is the key in the door, Marian? Can I lock the miserable necessity to Laura on the inside?"  "Yes, here is the key. Lock the door, and open the door to nobody until I come  upstairs again."  I kissed Laura and left Laura. It was a relief to myself as I walked away to hear the  key turned in the lock, and to know that the door was at Laura own command.
