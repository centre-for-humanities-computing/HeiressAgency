 When I reached home again after my interview with Mrs. Clements, I was struck  by the appearance of a change in Laura.  The unvarying gentleness and patience which long misfortune had tried so  cruelly and had never conquered yet, seemed now to have suddenly failed her.  Insensible to all Marian's attempts to soothe and amuse her, she sat, with her  neglected drawing pushed away on the table, her eyes resolutely cast down, her  fingers twining and untwining themselves restlessly in her lap. Marian rose  when I came in, with a silent distress in her face, waited for a moment to see  if Laura would look up at my approach, whispered to me, "Try if you can rouse  her," and left the room.  I sat down in the vacant chair—gently unclasped the poor, worn, restless  fingers, and took both her hands in mine.  "What are you thinking of, Laura? Tell me, my darling—try and tell me what it  is."  She struggled with herself, and raised her eyes to mine. "I can't feel happy,"  she said, "I can't help thinking——" She stopped, bent forward a little, and  laid her head on my shoulder, with a terrible mute helplessness that struck me  to the heart.  "Try to tell me," I repeated gently; "try to tell me why you are not happy."  "I am so useless—I am such a burden on both of you," she answered, with a  weary, hopeless sigh. "You work and get money, Walter, and Marian helps you.  Why is there nothing I can do? You will end in liking Marian better than you  like me—you will, because I am so helpless! Oh, don't, don't, don't treat me  like a child!"  I raised her head, and smoothed away the tangled hair that fell over her face,  and kissed her—my poor, faded flower! my lost, afflicted sister! "You shall  help us, Laura," I said, "you shall begin, my darling, to-day."  She looked at me with a feverish eagerness, with a breathless interest, that  made me tremble for the new life of hope which I had called into being by those  few words.  I rose, and set her drawing materials in order, and placed them near her again.  "You know that I work and get money by drawing," I said. "Now you have taken  such pains, now you are so much improved, you shall begin to work and get money  too. Try to finish this little sketch as nicely and prettily as you can. When  it is done I will take it away with me, and the same person will buy it who  buys all that I do. You shall keep your own earnings in your own purse, and  Marian shall come to you to help us, as often as she comes to me. Think how  useful you are going to make yourself to both of us, and you will soon be as  happy, Laura, as the day is long."  Her face grew eager, and brightened into a smile. In the moment while it  lasted, in the moment when she again took up the pencils that had been laid  aside, she almost looked like the Laura of past days.  I had rightly interpreted the first signs of a new growth and strength in her  mind, unconsciously expressing themselves in the notice she had taken of the  occupations which filled her sister's life and mine. Marian (when I told her  what had passed) saw, as I saw, that she was longing to assume her own little  position of importance, to raise herself in her own estimation and in  ours—and, from that day, we tenderly helped the new ambition which gave  promise of the hopeful, happier future, that might now not be far off. Her  drawings, as she finished them, or tried to finish them, were placed in my  hands. Marian took them from me and hid them carefully, and I set aside a  little weekly tribute from my earnings, to be offered to her as the price paid  by strangers for the poor, faint, valueless sketches, of which I was the only  purchaser. It was hard sometimes to maintain our innocent deception, when she  proudly brought out her purse to contribute her share towards the expenses, and  wondered with serious interest, whether I or she had earned the most that week.  I have all those hidden drawings in my possession still—they are my treasures  beyond price—the dear remembrances that I love to keep alive—the friends in  past adversity that my heart will never part from, my tenderness never forget.  Am I trifling, here, with the necessities of my task? am I looking forward to  the happier time which my narrative has not yet reached? Yes. Back again—back  to the days of doubt and dread, when the spirit within me struggled hard for  its life, in the icy stillness of perpetual suspense. I have paused and rested  for a while on my forward course. It is not, perhaps, time wasted, if the  friends who read these pages have paused and rested too.   I took the first opportunity I could find of speaking to Marian in private, and  of communicating to her the result of the inquiries which I had made that  morning. She seemed to share the opinion on the subject of my proposed journey  to Welmingham, which Mrs. Clements had already expressed to me.  "Surely, Walter," she said, "you hardly know enough yet to give you any hope of  claiming Mrs. Catherick's confidence? Is it wise to proceed to these  extremities, before you have really exhausted all safer and simpler means of  attaining your object? When you told me that Sir Percival and the Count were  the only two people in existence who knew the exact date of Laura's journey,  you forgot, and I forgot, that there was a third person who must surely know  it—I mean Mrs. Rubelle. Would it not be far easier, and far less dangerous,  to insist on a confession from her, than to force it from Sir Percival?"  "It might be easier," I replied, "but we are not aware of the full extent of  Mrs. Rubelle's connivance and interest in the conspiracy, and we are therefore  not certain that the date has been impressed on her mind, as it has been  assuredly impressed on the minds of Sir Percival and the Count. It is too late,  now, to waste the time on Mrs. Rubelle, which may be all-important to the  discovery of the one assailable point in Sir Percival's life. Are you thinking  a little too seriously, Marian, of the risk I may run in returning to  Hampshire? Are you beginning to doubt whether Sir Percival Glyde may not in the  end be more than a match for me?"  "He will not be more than your match," she replied decidedly, "because he will  not be helped in resisting you by the impenetrable wickedness of the Count."  "What has led you to that conclusion?" I replied, in some surprise.  "My own knowledge of Sir Percival's obstinacy and impatience of the Count's  control," she answered. "I believe he will insist on meeting you  single-handed—just as he insisted at first on acting for himself at  Blackwater Park. The time for suspecting the Count's interference will be the  time when you have Sir Percival at your mercy. His own interests will then be  directly threatened, and he will act, Walter, to terrible purpose in his own  defence."  "We may deprive him of his weapons beforehand," I said. "Some of the  particulars I have heard from Mrs. Clements may yet be turned to account  against him, and other means of strengthening the case may be at our disposal.  There are passages in Mrs. Michelson's narrative which show that the Count  found it necessary to place himself in communication with Mr. Fairlie, and  there may be circumstances which compromise him in that proceeding. While I am  away, Marian, write to Mr. Fairlie and say that you want an answer describing  exactly what passed between the Count and himself, and informing you also of  any particulars that may have come to his knowledge at the same time in  connection with his niece. Tell him that the statement you request will, sooner  or later, be insisted on, if he shows any reluctance to furnish you with it of  his own accord."  "The letter shall be written, Walter. But are you really determined to go to  Welmingham?"  "Absolutely determined. I will devote the next two days to earning what we want  for the week to come, and on the third day I go to Hampshire."  When the third day came I was ready for my journey.  As it was possible that I might be absent for some little time, I arranged with  Marian that we were to correspond every day—of course addressing each other  by assumed names, for caution's sake. As long as I heard from her regularly, I  should assume that nothing was wrong. But if the morning came and brought me no  letter, my return to London would take place, as a matter of course, by the  first train. I contrived to reconcile Laura to my departure by telling her that  I was going to the country to find new purchasers for her drawings and for  mine, and I left her occupied and happy. Marian followed me downstairs to the  street door.  "Remember what anxious hearts you leave here," she whispered, as we stood  together in the passage. "Remember all the hopes that hang on your safe return.  If strange things happen to you on this journey—if you and Sir Percival  meet——"  "What makes you think we shall meet?" I asked.  "I don't know—I have fears and fancies that I cannot account for. Laugh at  them, Walter, if you like—but, for God's sake, keep your temper if you come  in contact with that man!"  "Never fear, Marian! I answer for my self-control."  With those words we parted.  I walked briskly to the station. There was a glow of hope in me. There was a  growing conviction in my mind that my journey this time would not be taken in  vain. It was a fine, clear, cold morning. My nerves were firmly strung, and I  felt all the strength of my resolution stirring in me vigorously from head to  foot.  As I crossed the railway platform, and looked right and left among the people  congregated on it, to search for any faces among them that I knew, the doubt  occurred to me whether it might not have been to my advantage if I had adopted  a disguise before setting out for Hampshire. But there was something so  repellent to me in the idea—something so meanly like the common herd of spies  and informers in the mere act of adopting a disguise—that I dismissed the  question from consideration almost as soon as it had risen in my mind. Even as  a mere matter of expediency the proceeding was doubtful in the extreme. If I  tried the experiment at home the landlord of the house would sooner or later  discover me, and would have his suspicions aroused immediately. If I tried it  away from home the same persons might see me, by the commonest accident, with  the disguise and without it, and I should in that way be inviting the notice  and distrust which it was my most pressing interest to avoid. In my own  character I had acted thus far—and in my own character I was resolved to  continue to the end.  The train left me at Welmingham early in the afternoon.   Is there any wilderness of sand in the deserts of Arabia, is there any prospect  of desolation among the ruins of Palestine, which can rival the repelling  effect on the eye, and the depressing influence on the mind, of an English  country town in the first stage of its existence, and in the transition state  of its prosperity? I asked myself that question as I passed through the clean  desolation, the neat ugliness, the prim torpor of the streets of Welmingham.  And the tradesmen who stared after me from their lonely shops—the trees that  drooped helpless in their arid exile of unfinished crescents and squares—the  dead house-carcasses that waited in vain for the vivifying human element to  animate them with the breath of life—every creature that I saw, every object  that I passed, seemed to answer with one accord: The deserts of Arabia are  innocent of our civilised desolation—the ruins of Palestine are incapable of  our modern gloom!  I inquired my way to the quarter of the town in which Mrs. Catherick lived, and  on reaching it found myself in a square of small houses, one story high. There  was a bare little plot of grass in the middle, protected by a cheap wire fence.  An elderly nursemaid and two children were standing in a corner of the  enclosure, looking at a lean goat tethered to the grass. Two foot-passengers  were talking together on one side of the pavement before the houses, and an  idle little boy was leading an idle little dog along by a string on the other.  I heard the dull tinkling of a piano at a distance, accompanied by the  intermittent knocking of a hammer nearer at hand. These were all the sights and  sounds of life that encountered me when I entered the square.  I walked at once to the door of Number Thirteen—the number of Mrs.  Catherick's house—and knocked, without waiting to consider beforehand how I  might best present myself when I got in. The first necessity was to see Mrs.  Catherick. I could then judge, from my own observation, of the safest and  easiest manner of approaching the object of my visit.  The door was opened by a melancholy middle-aged woman servant. I gave her my  card, and asked if I could see Mrs. Catherick. The card was taken into the  front parlour, and the servant returned with a message requesting me to mention  what my business was.  "Say, if you please, that my business relates to Mrs. Catherick's daughter," I  replied. This was the best pretext I could think of, on the spur of the moment,  to account for my visit.  The servant again retired to the parlour, again returned, and this time begged  me, with a look of gloomy amazement, to walk in.  I entered a little room, with a flaring paper of the largest pattern on the  walls. Chairs, tables, cheffonier, and sofa, all gleamed with the glutinous  brightness of cheap upholstery. On the largest table, in the middle of the  room, stood a smart Bible, placed exactly in the centre on a red and yellow  woollen mat and at the side of the table nearest to the window, with a little  knitting-basket on her lap, and a wheezing, blear-eyed old spaniel crouched at  her feet, there sat an elderly woman, wearing a black net cap and a black silk  gown, and having slate-coloured mittens on her hands. Her iron-grey hair hung  in heavy bands on either side of her face—her dark eyes looked straight  forward, with a hard, defiant, implacable stare. She had full square cheeks, a  long, firm chin, and thick, sensual, colourless lips. Her figure was stout and  sturdy, and her manner aggressively self-possessed. This was Mrs. Catherick.  "You have come to speak to me about my daughter," she said, before I could  utter a word on my side. "Be so good as to mention what you have to say."  The tone of her voice was as hard, as defiant, as implacable as the expression  of her eyes. She pointed to a chair, and looked me all over attentively, from  head to foot, as I sat down in it. I saw that my only chance with this woman  was to speak to her in her own tone, and to meet her, at the outset of our  interview, on her own ground.  "You are aware," I said, "that your daughter has been lost?"  "I am perfectly aware of it."  "Have you felt any apprehension that the misfortune of her loss might be  followed by the misfortune of her death?"  "Yes. Have you come here to tell me she is dead?"  "I have."  "Why?"  She put that extraordinary question without the slightest change in her voice,  her face, or her manner. She could not have appeared more perfectly unconcerned  if I had told her of the death of the goat in the enclosure outside.  "Why?" I repeated. "Do you ask why I come here to tell you of your daughter's  death?"  "Yes. What interest have you in me, or in her? How do you come to know anything  about my daughter?"  "In this way. I met her on the night when she escaped from the Asylum, and I  assisted her in reaching a place of safety."  "You did very wrong."  "I am sorry to hear her mother say so."  "Her mother does say so. How do you know she is dead?"  "I am not at liberty to say how I know it—but I DO know it."  "Are you at liberty to say how you found out my address?"  "Certainly. I got your address from Mrs. Clements."  "Mrs. Clements is a foolish woman. Did she tell you to come here?"  "She did not."  "Then, I ask you again, why did you come?"  As she was determined to have her answer, I gave it to her in the plainest  possible form.  "I came," I said, "because I thought Anne Catherick's mother might have some  natural interest in knowing whether she was alive or dead."  "Just so," said Mrs. Catherick, with additional self-possession. "Had you no  other motive?"  I hesitated. The right answer to that question was not easy to find at a  moment's notice.  "If you have no other motive," she went on, deliberately taking off her  slate-coloured mittens, and rolling them up, "I have only to thank you for your  visit, and to say that I will not detain you here any longer. Your information  would be more satisfactory if you were willing to explain how you became  possessed of it. However, it justifies me, I suppose, in going into mourning.  There is not much alteration necessary in my dress, as you see. When I have  changed my mittens, I shall be all in black."  She searched in the pocket of her gown, drew out a pair of black lace mittens,  put them on with the stoniest and steadiest composure, and then quietly crossed  her hands in her lap.  "I wish you good morning," she said.  The cool contempt of her manner irritated me into directly avowing that the  purpose of my visit had not been answered yet.  "I HAVE another motive in coming here," I said.  "Ah! I thought so," remarked Mrs. Catherick.  "Your daughter's death——"  "What did she die of?"  "Of disease of the heart."  "Yes. Go on."  "Your daughter's death has been made the pretext for inflicting serious injury  on a person who is very dear to me. Two men have been concerned, to my certain  knowledge, in doing that wrong. One of them is Sir Percival Glyde."  "Indeed!"  I looked attentively to see if she flinched at the sudden mention of that name.  Not a muscle of her stirred—the hard, defiant, implacable stare in her eyes  never wavered for an instant.  "You may wonder," I went on, "how the event of your daughter's death can have  been made the means of inflicting injury on another person."  "No," said Mrs. Catherick; "I don't wonder at all. This appears to be your  affair. You are interested in my affairs. I am not interested in yours."  "You may ask, then," I persisted, "why I mention the matter in your presence."  "Yes, I DO ask that."  "I mention it because I am determined to bring Sir Percival Glyde to account  for the wickedness he has committed."  "What have I to do with your determination?"  "You shall hear. There are certain events in Sir Percival's past life which it  is necessary for my purpose to be fully acquainted with. YOU know them—and  for that reason I come to YOU."  "What events do you mean?"  "Events that occurred at Old Welmingham when your husband was parish-clerk at  that place, and before the time when your daughter was born."  I had reached the woman at last through the barrier of impenetrable reserve  that she had tried to set up between us. I saw her temper smouldering in her  eyes—as plainly as I saw her hands grow restless, then unclasp themselves,  and begin mechanically smoothing her dress over her knees.  "What do you know of those events?" she asked.  "All that Mrs. Clements could tell me," I answered.  There was a momentary flush on her firm square face, a momentary stillness in  her restless hands, which seemed to betoken a coming outburst of anger that  might throw her off her guard. But no—she mastered the rising irritation,  leaned back in her chair, crossed her arms on her broad bosom, and with a smile  of grim sarcasm on her thick lips, looked at me as steadily as ever.  "Ah! I begin to understand it all now," she said, her tamed and disciplined  anger only expressing itself in the elaborate mockery of her tone and manner.  "You have got a grudge of your own against Sir Percival Glyde, and I must help  you to wreak it. I must tell you this, that, and the other about Sir Percival  and myself, must I? Yes, indeed? You have been prying into my private affairs.  You think you have found a lost woman to deal with, who lives here on  sufferance, and who will do anything you ask for fear you may injure her in the  opinions of the town's-people. I see through you and your precious  speculation—I do! and it amuses me. Ha! ha!"  She stopped for a moment, her arms tightened over her bosom, and she laughed to  herself—a hard, harsh, angry laugh.  "You don't know how I have lived in this place, and what I have done in this  place, Mr. What's-your-name," she went on. "I'll tell you, before I ring the  bell and have you shown out. I came here a wronged woman—I came here robbed  of my character and determined to claim it back. I've been years and years  about it—and I HAVE claimed it back. I have matched the respectable people  fairly and openly on their own ground. If they say anything against me now they  must say it in secret—they can't say it, they daren't say it, openly. I stand  high enough in this town to be out of your reach. THE CLERGYMAN BOWS TO ME.  Aha! you didn't bargain for that when you came here. Go to the church and  inquire about me—you will find Mrs. Catherick has her sitting like the rest  of them, and pays the rent on the day it's due. Go to the town-hall. There's a  petition lying there—a petition of the respectable inhabitants against  allowing a circus to come and perform here and corrupt our morals—yes! OUR  morals. I signed that petition this morning. Go to the bookseller's shop. The  clergyman's Wednesday evening Lectures on Justification by Faith are publishing  there by subscription—I'm down on the list. The doctor's wife only put a  shilling in the plate at our last charity sermon—I put half-a-crown. Mr.  Churchwarden Soward held the plate, and bowed to me. Ten years ago he told  Pigrum the chemist I ought to be whipped out of the town at the cart's tail. Is  your mother alive? Has she got a better Bible on her table than I have got on  mine? Does she stand better with her trades-people than I do with mine? Has she  always lived within her income? I have always lived within mine. Ah! there IS  the clergyman coming along the square. Look, Mr. What's-your-name—look, if  you please!"  She started up with the activity of a young woman, went to the window, waited  till the clergyman passed, and bowed to him solemnly. The clergyman  ceremoniously raised his hat, and walked on. Mrs. Catherick returned to her  chair, and looked at me with a grimmer sarcasm than ever.  "There!" she said. "What do you think of that for a woman with a lost  character? How does your speculation look now?"  The singular manner in which she had chosen to assert herself, the  extraordinary practical vindication of her position in the town which she had  just offered, had so perplexed me that I listened to her in silent surprise. I  was not the less resolved, however, to make another effort to throw her off her  guard. If the woman's fierce temper once got beyond her control, and once  flamed out on me, she might yet say the words which would put the clue in my  hands.  "How does your speculation look now?" she repeated.  "Exactly as it looked when I first came in," I answered. "I don't doubt the  position you have gained in the town, and I don't wish to assail it even if I  could. I came here because Sir Percival Glyde is, to my certain knowledge, your  enemy, as well as mine. If I have a grudge against him, you have a grudge  against him too. You may deny it if you like, you may distrust me as much as  you please, you may be as angry as you will—but, of all the women in England,  you, if you have any sense of injury, are the woman who ought to help me to  crush that man."  "Crush him for yourself," she said; "then come back here, and see what I say to  you."  She spoke those words as she had not spoken yet, quickly, fiercely,  vindictively. I had stirred in its lair the serpent-hatred of years, but only  for a moment. Like a lurking reptile it leaped up at me as she eagerly bent  forward towards the place in which I was sitting. Like a lurking reptile it  dropped out of sight again as she instantly resumed her former position in the  chair.  "You won't trust me?" I said.  "No."  "You are afraid?"  "Do I look as if I was?"  "You are afraid of Sir Percival Glyde?"  "Am I?"  Her colour was rising, and her hands were at work again smoothing her gown. I  pressed the point farther and farther home, I went on without allowing her a  moment of delay.  "Sir Percival has a high position in the world," I said; "it would be no wonder  if you were afraid of him. Sir Percival is a powerful man, a baronet, the  possessor of a fine estate, the descendant of a great family——"  She amazed me beyond expression by suddenly bursting out laughing.  "Yes," she repeated, in tones of the bitterest, steadiest contempt. "A baronet,  the possessor of a fine estate, the descendant of a great family. Yes, indeed!  A great family—especially by the mother's side."  There was no time to reflect on the words that had just escaped her, there was  only time to feel that they were well worth thinking over the moment I left the  house.  "I am not here to dispute with you about family questions," I said. "I know  nothing of Sir Percival's mother——"  "And you know as little of Sir Percival himself," she interposed sharply.  "I advise you not to be too sure of that," I rejoined. "I know some things  about him, and I suspect many more."  "What do you suspect?"  "I'll tell you what I DON'T suspect. I DON'T suspect him of being Anne's  father."  She started to her feet, and came close up to me with a look of fury.  "How dare you talk to me about Anne's father! How dare you say who was her  father, or who wasn't!" she broke out, her face quivering, her voice trembling  with passion.  "The secret between you and Sir Percival is not THAT secret," I persisted. "The  mystery which darkens Sir Percival's life was not born with your daughter's  birth, and has not died with your daughter's death."  She drew back a step. "Go!" she said, and pointed sternly to the door.  "There was no thought of the child in your heart or in his," I went on,  determined to press her back to her last defences. "There was no bond of guilty  love between you and him when you held those stolen meetings, when your husband  found you whispering together under the vestry of the church."  Her pointing hand instantly dropped to her side, and the deep flush of anger  faded from her face while I spoke. I saw the change pass over her—I saw that  hard, firm, fearless, self-possessed woman quail under a terror which her  utmost resolution was not strong enough to resist when I said those five last  words, "the vestry of the church."  For a minute or more we stood looking at each other in silence. I spoke first.  "Do you still refuse to trust me?" I asked.  She could not call the colour that had left it back to her face, but she had  steadied her voice, she had recovered the defiant self-possession of her manner  when she answered me.  "I do refuse," she said.  "Do you still tell me to go?"  "Yes. Go—and never come back."  I walked to the door, waited a moment before I opened it, and turned round to  look at her again.  "I may have news to bring you of Sir Percival which you don't expect," I said,  "and in that case I shall come back."  "There is no news of Sir Percival that I don't expect, except——"  She stopped, her pale face darkened, and she stole back with a quiet, stealthy,  cat-like step to her chair.  "Except the news of his death," she said, sitting down again, with the mockery  of a smile just hovering on her cruel lips, and the furtive light of hatred  lurking deep in her steady eyes.  As I opened the door of the room to go out, she looked round at me quickly. The  cruel smile slowly widened her lips—she eyed me, with a strange stealthy  interest, from head to foot—an unutterable expectation showed itself wickedly  all over her face. Was she speculating, in the secrecy of her own heart, on my  youth and strength, on the force of my sense of injury and the limits of my  self-control, and was she considering the lengths to which they might carry me,  if Sir Percival and I ever chanced to meet? The bare doubt that it might be so  drove me from her presence, and silenced even the common forms of farewell on  my lips. Without a word more, on my side or on hers, I left the room.  As I opened the outer door, I saw the same clergyman who had already passed the  house once, about to pass it again, on his way back through the square. I  waited on the door-step to let him go by, and looked round, as I did so, at the  parlour window.  Mrs. Catherick had heard his footsteps approaching, in the silence of that  lonely place, and she was on her feet at the window again, waiting for him. Not  all the strength of all the terrible passions I had roused in that woman's  heart, could loosen her desperate hold on the one fragment of social  consideration which years of resolute effort had just dragged within her grasp.  There she was again, not a minute after I had left her, placed purposely in a  position which made it a matter of common courtesy on the part of the clergyman  to bow to her for a second time. He raised his hat once more. I saw the hard  ghastly face behind the window soften, and light up with gratified pride—I  saw the head with the grim black cap bend ceremoniously in return. The  clergyman had bowed to her, and in my presence, twice in one day!    IX  I Left the house, feeling that Mrs. Catherick had helped me a step forward, in  spite of herself. Before I had reached the turning which led out of the square,  my attention was suddenly aroused by the sound of a closing door behind me.  I looked round, and saw an undersized man in black on the door-step of a house,  which, as well as I could judge, stood next to Mrs. Catherick's place of  abode—next to it, on the side nearest to me. The man did not hesitate a  moment about the direction he should take. He advanced rapidly towards the  turning at which I had stopped. I recognised him as the lawyer's clerk, who had  preceded me in my visit to Blackwater Park, and who had tried to pick a quarrel  with me, when I asked him if I could see the house.  I waited where I was, to ascertain whether his object was to come to close  quarters and speak on this occasion. To my surprise he passed on rapidly,  without saying a word, without even looking up in my face as he went by. This  was such a complete inversion of the course of proceeding which I had every  reason to expect on his part, that my curiosity, or rather my suspicion, was  aroused, and I determined on my side to keep him cautiously in view, and to  discover what the business might be in which he was now employed. Without  caring whether he saw me or not, I walked after him. He never looked back, and  he led me straight through the streets to the railway station.  The train was on the point of starting, and two or three passengers who were  late were clustering round the small opening through which the tickets were  issued. I joined them, and distinctly heard the lawyer's clerk demand a ticket  for the Blackwater station. I satisfied myself that he had actually left by the  train before I came away.  There was only one interpretation that I could place on what I had just seen  and heard. I had unquestionably observed the man leaving a house which closely  adjoined Mrs. Catherick's residence. He had been probably placed there, by Sir  Percival's directions, as a lodger, in anticipation of my inquiries leading me,  sooner or later, to communicate with Mrs. Catherick. He had doubtless seen me  go in and come out, and he had hurried away by the first train to make his  report at Blackwater Park, to which place Sir Percival would naturally betake  himself (knowing what he evidently knew of my movements), in order to be ready  on the spot, if I returned to Hampshire. Before many days were over, there  seemed every likelihood now that he and I might meet.  Whatever result events might be destined to produce, I resolved to pursue my  own course, straight to the end in view, without stopping or turning aside for  Sir Percival or for any one. The great responsibility which weighed on me  heavily in London—the responsibility of so guiding my slightest actions as to  prevent them from leading accidentally to the discovery of Laura's place of  refuge—was removed, now that I was in Hampshire. I could go and come as I  pleased at Welmingham, and if I chanced to fail in observing any necessary  precautions, the immediate results, at least, would affect no one but myself.  When I left the station the winter evening was beginning to close in. There was  little hope of continuing my inquiries after dark to any useful purpose in a  neighbourhood that was strange to me. Accordingly, I made my way to the nearest  hotel, and ordered my dinner and my bed. This done, I wrote to Marian, to tell  her that I was safe and well, and that I had fair prospects of success. I had  directed her, on leaving home, to address the first letter she wrote to me (the  letter I expected to receive the next morning) to "The Post-Office,  Welmingham," and I now begged her to send her second day's letter to the same  address.  I could easily receive it by writing to the postmaster if I happened to be away  from the town when it arrived.  The coffee-room of the hotel, as it grew late in the evening, became a perfect  solitude. I was left to reflect on what I had accomplished that afternoon as  uninterruptedly as if the house had been my own. Before I retired to rest I had  attentively thought over my extraordinary interview with Mrs. Catherick from  beginning to end, and had verified at my leisure the conclusions which I had  hastily drawn in the earlier part of the day.  The vestry of Old Welmingham church was the starting-point from which my mind  slowly worked its way back through all that I had heard Mrs. Catherick say, and  through all I had seen Mrs. Catherick do.  At the time when the neighbourhood of the vestry was first referred to in my  presence by Mrs. Clements, I had thought it the strangest and most  unaccountable of all places for Sir Percival to select for a clandestine  meeting with the clerk's wife. Influenced by this impression, and by no other,  I had mentioned "the vestry of the church" before Mrs. Catherick on pure  speculation—it represented one of the minor peculiarities of the story which  occurred to me while I was speaking. I was prepared for her answering me  confusedly or angrily, but the blank terror that seized her when I said the  words took me completely by surprise. I had long before associated Sir  Percival's Secret with the concealment of a serious crime which Mrs. Catherick  knew of, but I had gone no further than this. Now the woman's paroxysm of  terror associated the crime, either directly or indirectly, with the vestry,  and convinced me that she had been more than the mere witness of it—she was  also the accomplice, beyond a doubt.  What had been the nature of the crime? Surely there was a contemptible side to  it, as well as a dangerous side, or Mrs. Catherick would not have repeated my  own words, referring to Sir Percival's rank and power, with such marked disdain  as she had certainly displayed. It was a contemptible crime then and a  dangerous crime, and she had shared in it, and it was associated with the  vestry of the church.  The next consideration to be disposed of led me a step farther from this point.  Mrs. Catherick's undisguised contempt for Sir Percival plainly extended to his  mother as well. She had referred with the bitterest sarcasm to the great family  he had descended from—"especially by the mother's side." What did this mean?  There appeared to be only two explanations of it. Either his mother's birth had  been low, or his mother's reputation was damaged by some hidden flaw with which  Mrs. Catherick and Sir Percival were both privately acquainted? I could only  put the first explanation to the test by looking at the register of her  marriage, and so ascertaining her maiden name and her parentage as a  preliminary to further inquiries.  On the other hand, if the second case supposed were the true one, what had been  the flaw in her reputation? Remembering the account which Marian had given me  of Sir Percival's father and mother, and of the suspiciously unsocial secluded  life they had both led, I now asked myself whether it might not be possible  that his mother had never been married at all. Here again the register might,  by offering written evidence of the marriage, prove to me, at any rate, that  this doubt had no foundation in truth. But where was the register to be found?  At this point I took up the conclusions which I had previously formed, and the  same mental process which had discovered the locality of the concealed crime,  now lodged the register also in the vestry of Old Welmingham church.  These were the results of my interview with Mrs. Catherick—these were the  various considerations, all steadily converging to one point, which decided the  course of my proceedings on the next day.   The morning was cloudy and lowering, but no rain fell. I left my bag at the  hotel to wait there till I called for it, and, after inquiring the way, set  forth on foot for Old Welmingham church.  It was a walk of rather more than two miles, the ground rising slowly all the  way.  On the highest point stood the church—an ancient, weather-beaten building,  with heavy buttresses at its sides, and a clumsy square tower in front. The  vestry at the back was built out from the church, and seemed to be of the same  age. Round the building at intervals appeared the remains of the village which  Mrs. Clements had described to me as her husband's place of abode in former  years, and which the principal inhabitants had long since deserted for the new  town. Some of the empty houses had been dismantled to their outer walls, some  had been left to decay with time, and some were still inhabited by persons  evidently of the poorest class. It was a dreary scene, and yet, in the worst  aspect of its ruin, not so dreary as the modern town that I had just left. Here  there was the brown, breezy sweep of surrounding fields for the eye to repose  on—here the trees, leafless as they were, still varied the monotony of the  prospect, and helped the mind to look forward to summer-time and shade.  As I moved away from the back of the church, and passed some of the dismantled  cottages in search of a person who might direct me to the clerk, I saw two men  saunter out after me from behind a wall. The tallest of the two—a stout  muscular man in the dress of a gamekeeper—was a stranger to me. The other was  one of the men who had followed me in London on the day when I left Mr. Kyrle's  office. I had taken particular notice of him at the time; and I felt sure that  I was not mistaken in identifying the fellow on this occasion.  Neither he nor his companion attempted to speak to me, and both kept themselves  at a respectful distance, but the motive of their presence in the neighbourhood  of the church was plainly apparent. It was exactly as I had supposed—Sir  Percival was already prepared for me. My visit to Mrs. Catherick had been  reported to him the evening before, and those two men had been placed on the  look-out near the church in anticipation of my appearance at Old Welmingham. If  I had wanted any further proof that my investigations had taken the right  direction at last, the plan now adopted for watching me would have supplied it.  I walked on away from the church till I reached one of the inhabited houses,  with a patch of kitchen garden attached to it on which a labourer was at work.  He directed me to the clerk's abode, a cottage at some little distance off,  standing by itself on the outskirts of the forsaken village. The clerk was  indoors, and was just putting on his greatcoat. He was a cheerful, familiar,  loudly-talkative old man, with a very poor opinion (as I soon discovered) of  the place in which he lived, and a happy sense of superiority to his neighbours  in virtue of the great personal distinction of having once been in London.  "It's well you came so early, sir," said the old man, when I had mentioned the  object of my visit. "I should have been away in ten minutes more. Parish  business, sir, and a goodish long trot before it's all done for a man at my  age. But, bless you, I'm strong on my legs still! As long as a man don't give  at his legs, there's a deal of work left in him. Don't you think so yourself,  sir?"  He took his keys down while he was talking from a hook behind the fireplace,  and locked his cottage door behind us.  "Nobody at home to keep house for me," said the clerk, with a cheerful sense of  perfect freedom from all family encumbrances. "My wife's in the churchyard  there, and my children are all married. A wretched place this, isn't it, sir?  But the parish is a large one—every man couldn't get through the business as  I do. It's learning does it, and I've had my share, and a little more. I can  talk the Queen's English (God bless the Queen!), and that's more than most of  the people about here can do. You're from London, I suppose, sir? I've been in  London a matter of five-and-twenty year ago. What's the news there now, if you  please?"  Chattering on in this way, he led me back to the vestry. I looked about to see  if the two spies were still in sight. They were not visible anywhere. After  having discovered my application to the clerk, they had probably concealed  themselves where they could watch my next proceedings in perfect freedom.  The vestry door was of stout old oak, studded with strong nails, and the clerk  put his large heavy key into the lock with the air of a man who knew that he  had a difficulty to encounter, and who was not quite certain of creditably  conquering it.  "I'm obliged to bring you this way, sir," he said, "because the door from the  vestry to the church is bolted on the vestry side. We might have got in through  the church otherwise. This is a perverse lock, if ever there was one yet. It's  big enough for a prison-door—it's been hampered over and over again, and it  ought to be changed for a new one. I've mentioned that to the churchwarden  fifty times over at least—he's always saying, 'I'll see about it'—and he  never does see. Ah, It's a sort of lost corner, this place. Not like  London—is it, sir? Bless you, we are all asleep here! We don't march with the  times."  After some twisting and turning of the key, the heavy lock yielded, and he  opened the door.  The vestry was larger than I should have supposed it to be, judging from the  outside only. It was a dim, mouldy, melancholy old room, with a low, raftered  ceiling. Round two sides of it, the sides nearest to the interior of the  church, ran heavy wooden presses, worm-eaten and gaping with age. Hooked to the  inner corner of one of these presses hung several surplices, all bulging out at  their lower ends in an irreverent-looking bundle of limp drapery. Below the  surplices, on the floor, stood three packing-cases, with the lids half off,  half on, and the straw profusely bursting out of their cracks and crevices in  every direction. Behind them, in a corner, was a litter of dusty papers, some  large and rolled up like architects' plans, some loosely strung together on  files like bills or letters. The room had once been lighted by a small side  window, but this had been bricked up, and a lantern skylight was now  substituted for it. The atmosphere of the place was heavy and mouldy, being  rendered additionally oppressive by the closing of the door which led into the  church. This door also was composed of solid oak, and was bolted at the top and  bottom on the vestry side.  "We might be tidier, mightn't we, sir?" said the cheerful clerk; "but when  you're in a lost corner of a place like this, what are you to do? Why, look  here now, just look at these packing-cases. There they've been, for a year or  more, ready to go down to London—there they are, littering the place, and  there they'll stop as long as the nails hold them together. I'll tell you what,  sir, as I said before, this is not London. We are all asleep here. Bless you,  WE don't march with the times!"  "What is there in the packing-cases?" I asked.  "Bits of old wood carvings from the pulpit, and panels from the chancel, and  images from the organ-loft," said the clerk. "Portraits of the twelve apostles  in wood, and not a whole nose among 'em. All broken, and worm-eaten, and  crumbling to dust at the edges. As brittle as crockery, sir, and as old as the  church, if not older."  "And why were they going to London? To be repaired?"  "That's it, sir, to be repaired, and where they were past repair, to be copied  in sound wood. But, bless you, the money fell short, and there they are,  waiting for new subscriptions, and nobody to subscribe. It was all done a year  ago, sir. Six gentlemen dined together about it, at the hotel in the new town.  They made speeches, and passed resolutions, and put their names down, and  printed off thousands of prospectuses. Beautiful prospectuses, sir, all  flourished over with Gothic devices in red ink, saying it was a disgrace not to  restore the church and repair the famous carvings, and so on. There are the  prospectuses that couldn't be distributed, and the architect's plans and  estimates, and the whole correspondence which set everybody at loggerheads and  ended in a dispute, all down together in that corner, behind the packing-cases.  The money dribbled in a little at first—but what CAN you expect out of  London? There was just enough, you know, to pack the broken carvings, and get  the estimates, and pay the printer's bill, and after that there wasn't a  halfpenny left. There the things are, as I said before. We have nowhere else to  put them—nobody in the new town cares about accommodating us—we're in a  lost corner—and this is an untidy vestry—and who's to help it?—that's  what I want to know."  My anxiety to examine the register did not dispose me to offer much  encouragement to the old man's talkativeness. I agreed with him that nobody  could help the untidiness of the vestry, and then suggested that we should  proceed to our business without more delay.  "Ay, ay, the marriage-register, to be sure," said the clerk, taking a little  bunch of keys from his pocket. "How far do you want to look back, sir?"  Marian had informed me of Sir Percival's age at the time when we had spoken  together of his marriage engagement with Laura. She had then described him as  being forty-five years old. Calculating back from this, and making due  allowance for the year that had passed since I had gained my information, I  found that he must have been born in eighteen hundred and four, and that I  might safely start on my search through the register from that date.  "I want to begin with the year eighteen hundred and four," I said.  "Which way after that, sir?" asked the clerk. "Forwards to our time or  backwards away from us?"  "Backwards from eighteen hundred and four."  He opened the door of one of the presses—the press from the side of which the  surplices were hanging—and produced a large volume bound in greasy brown  leather. I was struck by the insecurity of the place in which the register was  kept. The door of the press was warped and cracked with age, and the lock was  of the smallest and commonest kind. I could have forced it easily with the  walking-stick I carried in my hand.  "Is that considered a sufficiently secure place for the register?" I inquired.  "Surely a book of such importance as this ought to be protected by a better  lock, and kept carefully in an iron safe?"  "Well, now, that's curious!" said the clerk, shutting up the book again, just  after he had opened it, and smacking his hand cheerfully on the cover. "Those  were the very words my old master was always saying years and years ago, when I  was a lad. 'Why isn't the register' (meaning this register here, under my  hand)—'why isn't it kept in an iron safe?' If I've heard him say that once,  I've heard him say it a hundred times. He was the solicitor in those days, sir,  who had the appointment of vestry-clerk to this church. A fine hearty old  gentleman, and the most particular man breathing. As long as he lived he kept a  copy of this book in his office at Knowlesbury, and had it posted up regular,  from time to time, to correspond with the fresh entries here. You would hardly  think it, but he had his own appointed days, once or twice in every quarter,  for riding over to this church on his old white pony, to check the copy, by the  register, with his own eyes and hands. 'How do I know?' (he used to say) 'how  do I know that the register in this vestry may not be stolen or destroyed? Why  isn't it kept in an iron safe? Why can't I make other people as careful as I am  myself? Some of these days there will be an accident happen, and when the  register's lost, then the parish will find out the value of my copy.' He used  to take his pinch of snuff after that, and look about him as bold as a lord.  Ah! the like of him for doing business isn't easy to find now. You may go to  London and not match him, even THERE. Which year did you say, sir? Eighteen  hundred and what?"  "Eighteen hundred and four," I replied, mentally resolving to give the old man  no more opportunities of talking, until my examination of the register was over.  The clerk put on his spectacles, and turned over the leaves of the register,  carefully wetting his finger and thumb at every third page. "There it is, sir,"  said he, with another cheerful smack on the open volume. "There's the year you  want."  As I was ignorant of the month in which Sir Percival was born, I began my  backward search with the early part of the year. The register-book was of the  old-fashioned kind, the entries being all made on blank pages in manuscript,  and the divisions which separated them being indicated by ink lines drawn  across the page at the close of each entry.  I reached the beginning of the year eighteen hundred and four without  encountering the marriage, and then travelled back through December eighteen  hundred and three—through November and October—through——  No! not through September also. Under the heading of that month in the year I  found the marriage.  I looked carefully at the entry. It was at the bottom of a page, and was for  want of room compressed into a smaller space than that occupied by the  marriages above. The marriage immediately before it was impressed on my  attention by the circumstance of the bridegroom's Christian name being the same  as my own. The entry immediately following it (on the top of the next page) was  noticeable in another way from the large space it occupied, the record in this  case registering the marriages of two brothers at the same time. The register  of the marriage of Sir Felix Glyde was in no respect remarkable except for the  narrowness of the space into which it was compressed at the bottom of the page.  The information about his wife was the usual information given in such cases.  She was described as "Cecilia Jane Elster, of Park-View Cottages, Knowlesbury,  only daughter of the late Patrick Elster, Esq., formerly of Bath."  I noted down these particulars in my pocket-book, feeling as I did so both  doubtful and disheartened about my next proceedings. The Secret which I had  believed until this moment to be within my grasp seemed now farther from my  reach than ever.  What suggestions of any mystery unexplained had arisen out of my visit to the  vestry? I saw no suggestions anywhere. What progress had I made towards  discovering the suspected stain on the reputation of Sir Percival's mother? The  one fact I had ascertained vindicated her reputation. Fresh doubts, fresh  difficulties, fresh delays began to open before me in interminable prospect.  What was I to do next? The one immediate resource left to me appeared to be  this. I might institute inquiries about "Miss Elster of Knowlesbury," on the  chance of advancing towards the main object of my investigation, by first  discovering the secret of Mrs. Catherick's contempt for Sir Percival's mother.  "Have you found what you wanted, sir?" said the clerk, as I closed the  register-book.  "Yes," I replied, "but I have some inquiries still to make. I suppose the  clergyman who officiated here in the year eighteen hundred and three is no  longer alive?"  "No, no, sir, he was dead three or four years before I came here, and that was  as long ago as the year twenty-seven. I got this place, sir," persisted my  talkative old friend, "through the clerk before me leaving it. They say he was  driven out of house and home by his wife—and she's living still down in the  new town there. I don't know the rights of the story myself—all I know is I  got the place. Mr. Wansborough got it for me—the son of my old master that I  was tell you of. He's a free, pleasant gentleman as ever lived—rides to the  hounds, keeps his pointers and all that. He's vestry-clerk here now as his  father was before him."  "Did you not tell me your former master lived at Knowlesbury?" I asked, calling  to mind the long story about the precise gentleman of the old school with which  my talkative friend had wearied me before he opened the register-book.  "Yes, to be sure, sir," replied the clerk. "Old Mr. Wansborough lived at  Knowlesbury, and young Mr. Wansborough lives there too."  "You said just now he was vestry-clerk, like his father before him. I am not  quite sure that I know what a vestry-clerk is."  "Don't you indeed, sir?—and you come from London too! Every parish church,  you know, has a vestry-clerk and a parish-clerk. The parish-clerk is a man like  me (except that I've got a deal more learning than most of them—though I  don't boast of it). The vestry-clerk is a sort of an appointment that the  lawyers get, and if there's any business to be done for the vestry, why there  they are to do it. It's just the same in London. Every parish church there has  got its vestry-clerk—and you may take my word for it he's sure to be a  lawyer."  "Then young Mr. Wansborough is a lawyer, I suppose?"  "Of course he is, sir! A lawyer in High Street, Knowlesbury—the old offices  that his father had before him. The number of times I've swept those offices  out, and seen the old gentleman come trotting in to business on his white pony,  looking right and left all down the street and nodding to everybody! Bless you,  he was a popular character!—he'd have done in London!"  "How far is it to Knowlesbury from this place?"  "A long stretch, sir," said the clerk, with that exaggerated idea of distances,  and that vivid perception of difficulties in getting from place to place, which  is peculiar to all country people. "Nigh on five mile, I can tell you!"  It was still early in the forenoon. There was plenty of time for a walk to  Knowlesbury and back again to Welmingham; and there was no person probably in  the town who was fitter to assist my inquiries about the character and position  of Sir Percival's mother before her marriage than the local solicitor.  Resolving to go at once to Knowlesbury on foot, I led the way out of the vestry.  "Thank you kindly, sir," said the clerk, as I slipped my little present into  his hand. "Are you really going to walk all the way to Knowlesbury and back?  Well! you're strong on your legs, too—and what a blessing that is, isn't it?  There's the road, you can't miss it. I wish I was going your way—it's  pleasant to meet with gentlemen from London in a lost corner like this. One  hears the news. Wish you good-morning, sir, and thank you kindly once more."  We parted. As I left the church behind me I looked back, and there were the two  men again on the road below, with a third in their company, that third person  being the short man in black whom I had traced to the railway the evening  before.  The three stood talking together for a little while, then separated. The man in  black went away by himself towards Welmingham—the other two remained  together, evidently waiting to follow me as soon as I walked on.  I proceeded on my way without letting the fellows see that I took any special  notice of them. They caused me no conscious irritation of feeling at that  moment—on the contrary, they rather revived my sinking hopes. In the surprise  of discovering the evidence of the marriage, I had forgotten the inference I  had drawn on first perceiving the men in the neighbourhood of the vestry. Their  reappearance reminded me that Sir Percival had anticipated my visit to Old  Welmingham church as the next result of my interview with Mrs.  Catherick—otherwise he would never have placed his spies there to wait for  me. Smoothly and fairly as appearances looked in the vestry, there was  something wrong beneath them—there was something in the register-book, for  aught I knew, that I had not discovered yet.
