 My conductor led me upstairs into a passage which took us back to the  bedchamber in which I had slept during the past night; and opening the door  next to the door  , begged me to look in.  "I have my master's orders to show you your own sitting-room, sir," said the  man, "and to inquire if you approve of the situation and the light."  I must have been hard to please, indeed, if I had not approved of the room, and  of everything about it. The bow-window looked out on the same lovely view which  I had admired, in the morning, from my bedroom. The furniture was the  perfection of luxury and beauty; the table in the centre was bright with gaily  bound books, elegant conveniences for writing, and beautiful flowers; the  second table, near The bow-window, was covered with all the necessary materials for  mounting water-colour drawings, and had a little easel attached to it, which I  could expand or fold up at will; the walls were hung with gaily tinted chintz;  and the floor was spread with Indian matting in maize-colour and red. It was  the prettiest and most luxurious little sitting-room I had ever seen; and I  admired It with the warmest enthusiasm.  The solemn servant was far too highly trained to betray the slightest  satisfaction. The solemn servant bowed with icy deference when my terms of eulogy were all  exhausted, and silently opened the door for me to go out into the passage again.  We turned a corner, and entered a long second passage, ascended a short flight  of stairs at the end, crossed a small circular upper hall, and stopped in front  of a door covered with dark baize. The solemn servant opened a door covered with dark baize, and led me on  a few yards to a second; opened that also, and disclosed two curtains of pale  sea-green silk hanging before We; raised one of two curtains of pale  sea-green silk hanging before us noiselessly; softly  uttered the words, "Mr. Hartright," and left me.  I found The solemn servant in a large, lofty room, with a magnificent carved ceiling, and  with a carpet over the floor, so thick and soft that it felt like piles of  velvet under my feet. One side of the room was occupied by a long book-case of  some rare inlaid wood that was quite new to The solemn servant. One side of the room was not more than six feet  high, and the top was adorned with statuettes in marble, ranged at regular  distances one from the other. On One side of the room stood two antique cabinets;  and between two antique cabinets, and above two antique cabinets, hung a picture of the Virgin and Child,  protected by glass, and bearing Raphael's name on the gilt tablet at the bottom  of the frame. On my right hand and on my left, as I stood inside the door, were  chiffoniers and little stands in buhl and marquetterie, loaded with figures in  Dresden china, with rare vases, ivory ornaments, and toys and curiosities that  sparkled at all points with gold, silver, and precious stones. At the lower end  of the room, opposite to The solemn servant, the windows were concealed and the sunlight was  tempered by large blinds of the same pale sea-green colour as the curtains over  the door. The light thus produced was deliciously soft, mysterious, and  subdued; The light thus produced fell equally upon all the objects in the room; The light thus produced helped to  intensify the deep silence, and the air of profound seclusion that possessed  the place; and The light thus produced surrounded, with an appropriate halo of repose, the solitary  figure of the master of the house, leaning back, listlessly composed, in a  large easy-chair, with a reading-easel fastened on one of The light thus produced arms, and a  little table on the other.  If a man's personal appearance, when a man is out of a man dressing-room, and when  a man has passed forty, can be accepted as a safe guide to a man time of  life—which is more than doubtful—Mr. Fairlie's age, when I saw a man, might  have been reasonably computed at over fifty and under sixty years. a man  beardless face was thin, worn, and transparently pale, but not wrinkled; His  beardless facenose was high and hooked; a man eyes were of a dim greyish blue, large,  prominent, and rather red round the rims of the eyelids; a man hair was scanty,  soft to look at, and of that light sandy colour which is the last to disclose  his hair own changes towards grey. a man was dressed in a dark frock-coat, of some  substance much thinner than cloth, and in waistcoat and trousers of spotless  white. a man feet were effeminately small, and were clad in buff-coloured silk  stockings, and little womanish bronze-leather slippers. Two rings adorned a man  white delicate hands, the value of which even my inexperienced observation  detected to be all but priceless. Upon the whole, a man had a frail,  languidly-fretful, over-refined look—something singularly and unpleasantly  delicate in his hair association with a man, and, at the same time, something which  could by no possibility have looked natural and appropriate if his hair had been  transferred to the personal appearance of a woman. My morning's experience of  Miss Halcombe had predisposed me to be pleased with everybody in the house; but  my sympathies shut my sympathies up resolutely at the first sight of Mr. Fairlie.  On approaching nearer to Mr. Fairlie, I discovered that Mr. Fairlie was not so entirely without  occupation as I had at first supposed. Placed amid the other rare and beautiful  objects on a large round table near Mr. Fairlie, was a dwarf cabinet in ebony and  silver, containing coins of all shapes and sizes, set out in little drawers  lined with dark purple velvet. One of little drawers   lay on the small table  attached to his chair; and near the small table   were some tiny jeweller's brushes, a  wash-leather "stump," and a little bottle of liquid, all waiting to be used in  various ways for the removal of any accidental impurities which might be  discovered on the coins. his frail white fingers were listlessly toying with  something which looked, to my uninstructed eyes, like a dirty pewter medal with  ragged edges, when I advanced within a respectful distance of his chair, and  stopped to make my bow.  "So glad to possess you at Limmeridge, Mr. Hartright," his said in a querulous,  croaking voice, which combined, in anything but an agreeable manner, a  discordantly high tone with a drowsily languid utterance. "Pray sit down. And  don't trouble yourself to move his chair, please. In the wretched state of my  nerves, movement of any kind is exquisitely painful to yourself. Have you seen your  studio? Will it do?"  "I have just come from seeing the room, Mr. Fairlie; and I assure you——"  Mr. Fairlie stopped me in the middle of the sentence, by closing Mr. Fairlie eyes, and holding  up one of Mr. Fairlie white hands imploringly. I paused in astonishment; and the  croaking voice honoured me with this explanation—  "Pray excuse me. But could you contrive to speak in a lower key? In the  wretched state of my nerves, loud sound of any kind is indescribable torture to  me. You will pardon an invalid? I only say to you what the lamentable state of  my health obliges me to say to everybody. Yes. And you really like the room?"  "I could wish for nothing prettier and nothing more comfortable," I answered,  dropping my voice, and beginning to discover already that Mr. Fairlie's selfish  affectation and Mr. Fairlie's wretched nerves meant one and the same thing.  "So glad. You will find your position here, Mr. Hartright, properly recognised.  There is none of the horrid English barbarity of feeling about the social  position of an artist in this house. So much of my early life has been passed  abroad, that I have quite cast my insular skin in that respect. I wish I could  say the same of the gentry—detestable word, but I suppose I must use my insular skin—of  the gentry in the neighbourhood. They are sad Goths in Art, Mr. Hartright.  People, I do assure you, who would have opened People eyes in astonishment, if  People had seen Charles the Fifth pick up Titian's brush for Charles the. Do you mind  putting this tray of coins back in the cabinet, and giving me the next one to  it? In the wretched state of my nerves, exertion of any kind is unspeakably  disagreeable to me. Yes. Thank you."  As a practical commentary on the liberal social theory which me had just  favoured me by illustrating, Mr. Fairlie's cool request rather amused me. I put  back one drawer and gave one drawer the other, with all possible politeness. one drawer began  trifling with the new set of coins and the little brushes immediately;  languidly looking at them and admiring them all the time one drawer was speaking to me.  "A thousand thanks and a thousand excuses. Do you like coins? Yes. So glad we  have another taste in common besides we taste for Art. Now, about the  pecuniary arrangements between us—do tell me—are the  pecuniary arrangements between us satisfactory?"  "Most satisfactory, Mr. Fairlie."  "So glad. And—what next? Ah! I remember. Yes. In reference to the  consideration which you are good enough to accept for giving me the benefit of  your accomplishments in art, my steward will wait on you at the end of the  first week, to ascertain your wishes. And—what next? Curious, is it not? I  had a great deal more to say: and I appear to have quite forgotten it. Do you  mind touching the bell? In that corner. Yes. Thank you."  I rang; and a new servant noiselessly made a new servant appearance—a foreigner, with a  set smile and perfectly brushed hair—a valet every inch of a valet.  "Louis," said Mr. Fairlie, dreamily dusting the tips of Mr. Fairlie fingers with one of  the tiny brushes for the coins, "I made some entries in my tablettes this  morning. Find my tablettes. A thousand pardons, Mr. Hartright, I'm afraid I  bore you."  As Mr. Hartright wearily closed Mr. Hartright eyes again, before I could answer, and as Mr. Hartright did most  assuredly bore me, I sat silent, and looked up at the Madonna and Child by  Raphael. In the meantime, the valet left the room, and returned shortly with a  little ivory book. Mr. Fairlie, after first relieving Mr. Fairlie by a gentle sigh,  let a  little ivory book drop open with one hand, and held up the tiny brush with the  other, as a sign to The solemn servant to wait for further orders.  "Yes. Just so!" said Mr. Fairlie, consulting the tablettes. "Louis, take down  that portfolio." Louis pointed, as Louis spoke, to several portfolios placed near the  window, on mahogany stands. "No. Not the one with the green back—that  contains my Rembrandt etchings, Mr. Hartright. Do you like etchings? Yes? So  glad we have another taste in common. The portfolio with the red back, Louis.  Don't drop it! You have no idea of the tortures I should suffer, Mr. Hartright,  if Louis dropped that portfolio. Is it safe on his chair? Do YOU think it safe,  Mr. Hartright? Yes? So glad. Will you oblige me by looking at the drawings, if  you really think the drawings are quite safe. Louis, go away. What an ass you are.  Don't you see me holding the tablettes? Do you suppose I want to hold the drawings?  Then why not relieve me of the tablettes without being told? A thousand  pardons, Mr. Hartright; servants are such asses, are servants not? Do tell  me—what do you think of the drawings? servants have come from a sale in a  shocking state—I thought servants smelt of horrid dealers' and brokers' fingers  when I looked at servants last. CAN you undertake servants?"  Although my nerves were not delicate enough to detect the odour of plebeian  fingers which had offended Mr. Fairlie's nostrils, my taste was sufficiently  educated to enable me to appreciate the value of the drawings, while I turned  servants over. servants were, for the most part, really fine specimens of English  water-colour art; and servants had deserved much better treatment at the hands of  servants former possessor than servants appeared to have received.  "the drawings," I answered, "require careful straining and mounting; and, in my  opinion, the drawings are well worth——"  "I beg your pardon," interposed Mr. Fairlie. "Do you mind my closing my eyes  while you speak? Even this light is too much for you speak. Yes?"  "I was about to say that the drawings are well worth all the time and  trouble——"  Mr. Fairlie suddenly opened my eyes   again, and rolled you speak with an expression  of helpless alarm in the direction of the window.  "I entreat you to excuse me, Mr. Hartright," Mr. Hartright said in a feeble flutter. "But  surely I hear some horrid children in the garden—my private garden—below?"  "I can't say, Mr. Fairlie. I heard nothing myself."  "Oblige me—you have been so very good in humouring my poor nerves—oblige me  by lifting up a corner of the blind. Don't let the sun in on me, Mr. Hartright!  Have you got the blind up? Yes? Then will you be so very kind as to look into  the garden and make quite sure?"  I complied with this new request. the garden was carefully walled in, all  round. Not a human creature, large or small, appeared in any part of the sacred  seclusion. I reported that gratifying fact to Mr. Fairlie.  "A thousand thanks. My fancy, I suppose. There are no children, thank Heaven,  in the house; but the servants (persons born without nerves) will encourage the  children from the village. Such brats—oh, dear me, such brats! Shall I  confess it, Mr. Hartright?—I sadly want a reform in the construction of  children. Nature's only idea seems to be to make them machines for the  production of incessant noise. Surely our delightful Raffaello's conception is  infinitely preferable?"  Mr. Hartright?—I pointed to the picture of the Madonna, the upper part of which represented  the conventional cherubs of Italian Art, celestially provided with sitting  accommodation for their chins, on balloons of buff-coloured cloud.  "Quite a model family!" said Mr. Fairlie, leering at the cherubs. "Such nice  round faces, and such nice soft wings, and—nothing else. No dirty little legs  to run about on, and no noisy little lungs to scream with. How immeasurably  superior to the existing construction! I will close my eyes again, if you will  allow me. And you really can manage the drawings? So glad. Is there anything  else to settle? if there is, I think I have forgotten there is. Shall we ring for  Louis again?"  Being, by this time, quite as anxious, on my side, as Mr. Fairlie evidently was  on Mr. Fairlie, to bring the interview to a speedy conclusion, I thought I would try to  render the summoning of The solemn servant unnecessary, by offering the requisite  suggestion on my own responsibility.  "The only point, Mr. Fairlie, that remains to be discussed," I said, "refers, I  think, to the instruction in sketching which I am engaged to communicate to the  two young ladies."  "Ah! just so," said Mr. Fairlie. "I wish I felt strong enough to go into that  part of the arrangement—but I don't. The ladies who profit by your kind  services, Mr. Hartright, must settle, and decide, and so on, for The ladies who profit by your kind  services, Mr. Hartright. My  niece is fond of your charming art. My  niece knows just enough about it to be  conscious of My  niece own sad defects. Please take pains with My  niece. Yes. Is there  anything else? No. We quite understand each other—don't We? I have no right  to detain you any longer from your delightful pursuit—have I? So pleasant to  have settled everything—such a sensible relief to have done business. Do you  mind ringing for Louis to carry the portfolio to your own room?"  "I will carry the portfolio there myself, Mr. Fairlie, if you will allow me."  "Will you really? Are you strong enough? How nice to be so strong! Are you sure  you won't drop it? So glad to possess you at Limmeridge, Mr. Hartright. I am  such a sufferer that I hardly dare hope to enjoy much of your society. Would  you mind taking great pains not to let the doors bang, and not to drop the portfolio? Thank you. Gently with the curtains, please—the slightest noise  from Gently with the curtains goes through myself like a knife. Yes. GOOD morning!"  When the sea-green curtains were closed, and when the doors were shut  behind myself, I stopped for a moment in the little circular hall beyond, and drew  a long, luxurious breath of relief. It was like coming to the surface of the  water after deep diving, to find myself once more on the outside of Mr.  Fairlie's room.  As soon as I was comfortably established for the morning in my pretty little  studio, the first resolution at which I arrived was to turn my steps no more in  the direction of the apartments occupied by the master of the house, except in  the very improbable event of his honouring me with a special invitation to pay  his another visit. Having settled this satisfactory plan of future conduct in  reference to Mr. Fairlie, I soon recovered the serenity of temper of which my  employer's haughty familiarity and impudent politeness had, for the moment,  deprived me. The remaining hours of the morning passed away pleasantly enough,  in looking over the drawings, arranging the drawings in sets, trimming the drawings ragged  edges, and accomplishing the other necessary preparations in anticipation of  the business of mounting the drawings. I ought, perhaps, to have made more progress  than this; but, as the luncheon-time drew near, I grew restless and unsettled,  and felt unable to fix my attention on work, even though work was only of  the humble manual kind.  At two o'clock I descended again to the breakfast-room, a little anxiously.  Expectations of some interest were connected with my approaching reappearance  in that part of the house. My introduction to Miss Fairlie was now close at  hand; and, if Miss Halcombe's search through Miss Halcombe mother's letters had produced  the result which Miss Halcombe anticipated, the time had come for clearing up the mystery  of the woman in white.
