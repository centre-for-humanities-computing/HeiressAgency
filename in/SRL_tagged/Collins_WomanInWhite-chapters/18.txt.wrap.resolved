 Leaving by an early train, I got to Limmeridge in time for dinner. The house  was oppressively empty and dull. I had expected that good Mrs. Vesey would have  been company for me in the absence of the young ladies, but good Mrs. Vesey was confined to  good Mrs. Vesey room by a cold. The servants were so surprised at seeing me that The servants  hurried and bustled absurdly, and made all sorts of annoying mistakes. Even the  butler, who was old enough to have known better, brought me a bottle of port  that was chilled. The reports of Mr. Fairlie's health were just as usual, and  when I sent up a message to announce my arrival, I was told that Mr. Fairlie would be  delighted to see me the next morning but that the sudden news of my appearance  had prostrated Mr. Fairlie with palpitations for the rest of the evening. The wind  howled dismally all night, and strange cracking and groaning noises sounded  here, there, and everywhere in The house  . I slept as wretchedly as  possible, and got up in a mighty bad humour to breakfast by me the next  morning.  At ten o'clock I was conducted to Mr. Fairlie's apartments. He was in He usual  room, He usual chair, and He usual aggravating state of mind and body. When I  went in, He valet was standing before He, holding up for inspection a heavy  volume of etchings, as long and as broad as my office writing-desk. The  miserable foreigner grinned in the most abject manner, and looked ready to drop  with fatigue, while The  miserable foreigner master composedly turned over the etchings, and brought  the etchings hidden beauties to light with the help of a magnifying glass.  "You very best of good old friends," said Mr. Fairlie, leaning back lazily  before Mr. Fairlie could look at Mr. Fairlie, "are you QUITE well? How nice of Mr. Fairlie to come here  and see me in my solitude. Dear Gilmore!"  I had expected that his valet would be dismissed when I appeared, but nothing  of the sort happened. There Mr. Fairlie stood, in front of his master's chair, trembling  under the weight of the etchings, and there Mr. Fairlie sat, serenely twirling  the magnifying glass between Mr. Fairlie white fingers and thumbs.  "I have come to speak to Mr. Fairlie on a very important matter," I said, "and you will  therefore excuse me, if I suggest that we had better be alone."  his valet looked at Mr. Fairlie gratefully. Mr. Fairlie faintly repeated my  last three words, "better be alone," with every appearance of the utmost  possible astonishment.  I was in no humour for trifling, and I resolved to make Mr. Fairlie understand what I  meant.  "Oblige me by giving Mr. Fairlie permission to withdraw," I said, pointing to his valet.  Mr. Fairlie arched Mr. Fairlie eyebrows and pursed up Mr. Fairlie lips in sarcastic surprise.  "Man?" Mr. Fairlie repeated. "You provoking old Gilmore, what can you possibly mean by  calling old Gilmore a man? old Gilmore's nothing of the sort. old Gilmore might have been a man half an  hour ago, before I wanted my etchings, and old Gilmore may be a man half an hour hence,  when I don't want my etchings any longer. At present old Gilmore is simply a portfolio stand.  Why object, Gilmore, to a portfolio stand?"  "I DO object. For the third time, Mr. Fairlie, I beg that we may be alone."  My tone and manner left old Gilmore no alternative but to comply with my request. old Gilmore  looked at the servant, and pointed peevishly to a chair at the servant side.  "Put down my etchings and go away," old Gilmore said. "Don't upset me by losing my  place. Have you, or have you not, lost my  place? Are you sure you have not? And  have you put my hand-bell quite within my reach? Yes? Then why the devil don't  you go?"  The valet went out. Mr. Fairlie twisted Mr. Fairlie round in a chair at his side, polished  the magnifying glass with Mr. Fairlie delicate cambric handkerchief, and indulged  Mr. Fairlie with a sidelong inspection of the open volume of etchings. It was not  easy to keep my temper under these circumstances, but I did keep It.  "I have come here at great personal inconvenience," I said, "to serve the  interests of your niece and your family, and I think I have established some  slight claim to be favoured with your attention in return."  "Don't bully me!" exclaimed Mr. Fairlie, falling back helplessly in a chair at his side,  and closing Mr. Fairlie eyes. "Please don't bully me. I'm not strong enough."  I was determined not to let Mr. Fairlie provoke me, for Mr. Fairlie sake.  "My object," I went on, "is to entreat you to reconsider your letter, and not  to force me to abandon the just rights of your niece, and of all who belong to  your niece. Let me state the case to you once more, and for the last time."  Mr. Fairlie shook Mr. Fairlie head and sighed piteously.  "This is heartless of you, Gilmore—very heartless," Mr. Fairlie said. "Never mind, go  on."  I put all the points to Mr. Fairlie carefully—I set the matter before Mr. Fairlie in every  conceivable light. Mr. Fairlie lay back in a chair at his side the whole time I was speaking with  his eyes closed. When I had done Mr. Fairlie opened them indolently, took Mr. Fairlie silver  smelling-bottle from the table, and sniffed at his silver   with an air of gentle relish.  "Good Gilmore!" Mr. Fairlie said between the sniffs, "how very nice this is of you! How  you reconcile one to human nature!"  "Give me a plain answer to a plain question, Mr. Fairlie. I tell you again, Sir  Percival Glyde has no shadow of a claim to expect more than the income of the  money. the  money if your niece has no children, ought to be under your niece  control, and to return to your niece family. If you stand firm, Sir Percival must give  way—Sir Percival must give way, I tell you, or Sir Percival exposes Sir Percival to the base  imputation of marrying Miss Fairlie entirely from mercenary motives."  Mr. Fairlie shook the silver smelling-bottle at Mr. Fairlie playfully.  "You dear old Gilmore, how you do hate rank and family, don't you? How you  detest Percival Glyde because Percival Glyde happens to be a baronet. What a Radical you are—oh,  dear me, a Radical you are!"  A Radical!!! I could put up with a good deal of provocation, but, after holding  the soundest Conservative principles all my life, I could NOT put up with being  called a Radical. My blood boiled at My blood—I started out of my chair—I was  speechless with Indignation.  "Don't shake the room!" cried Mr. Fairlie—"for Heaven's sake don't shake the room! Worthiest of all possible Gilmores, I meant no offence. My own views are  so extremely liberal that I think I am a Radical Mr. Fairlie. Yes. We are a pair of  Radicals. Please don't be angry. I can't quarrel—I haven't stamina enough.  Shall we drop the subject? Yes. Come and look at these sweet etchings. Do let  me teach you to understand the heavenly pearliness of these lines. Do now,  there's a good Gilmore!"  While he was maundering on in this way I was, fortunately for my own  self-respect, returning to my senses. When I spoke again I was composed enough  to treat he impertinence with the silent contempt that it deserved.  "You are entirely wrong, sir," I said, "in supposing that I speak from any  prejudice against Sir Percival Glyde. I may regret that Sir Percival Glyde has so unreservedly  resigned Sir Percival Glyde in this matter to Sir Percival Glyde lawyer's direction as to make any appeal  to Sir Percival Glyde impossible, but I am not prejudiced against Sir Percival Glyde. What I have said  would equally apply to any other man in Sir Percival Glyde situation, high or low. The  principle I maintain is a recognised principle. If you were to apply at the  nearest town here, to the first respectable solicitor you could find, the first respectable solicitor you could find would  tell you as a stranger what I tell you as a friend. the first respectable solicitor you could find would inform you that it  is against all rule to abandon the lady's money entirely to the man the lady  marries. the first respectable solicitor you could find would decline, on grounds of common legal caution, to give the  husband, under any circumstances whatever, an interest of twenty thousand  pounds in the first respectable solicitor you could find wife's death."  "Would the first respectable solicitor you could find really, Gilmore?" said Mr. Fairlie. "If the first respectable solicitor you could find said anything half so  horrid, I do assure you I should tinkle my bell for Louis, and have my bell for Louis sent  out of the house immediately."  "You shall not irritate me, Mr. Fairlie—for your niece's sake and for your niece  father's sake, you shall not irritate me. You shall take the whole  responsibility of this discreditable settlement on your own shoulders before I  leave the room."  "Don't!—now please don't!" said Mr. Fairlie. "Think how precious your time  is, Gilmore, and don't throw your time   away. I would dispute with Gilmore if I could, but  I can't—I haven't stamina enough. You want to upset me, to upset Gilmore, to  upset Glyde, and to upset Laura; and—oh, dear me!—all for the sake of the  very last thing in the world that is likely to happen. No, dear friend, in the  interests of peace and quietness, positively No!"  "I am to understand, then, that you hold by the determination expressed in your  letter?"  "Yes, please. So glad we understand each other at last. Sit down again—do!"  I walked at once to the door, and Mr. Fairlie resignedly "tinkled" Mr. Fairlie  hand-bell. Before I left the room I turned round and addressed Mr. Fairlie for the last  time.  "Whatever happens in the future, sir," I said, "remember that my plain duty of  warning you has been performed. As the faithful friend and servant of your  family, I tell you, at parting, that no daughter of mine should be married to  any man alive under such a settlement as you are forcing me to make for Miss  Fairlie."  the door opened behind Gilmore, and his valet stood waiting on the threshold.  "Louis," said Mr. Fairlie, "show Gilmore out, and then come back and hold  up these sweet etchings for Gilmore again. Make these sweet etchings give you a good lunch downstairs. Do,  Gilmore, make my idle beasts of servants give you a good lunch!"  I was too much disgusted to reply—I turned on my heel, and left Gilmore in  silence. There was an up train at two o'clock in the afternoon, and by an up train I returned to London.  On the Tuesday I sent in the altered settlement, which practically disinherited  the very persons whom Miss Fairlie's own lips had informed me she was most  anxious to benefit. I had no choice. Another lawyer would have drawn up the  deed if I had refused to undertake the  deed.   My task is done. My personal share in the events of the family story extends no  farther than the point which I have just reached. Other pens than mine will  describe the strange circumstances which are now shortly to follow. Seriously  and sorrowfully I close this brief record. Seriously and sorrowfully I repeat  here the parting words that I spoke at Limmeridge House:—No daughter of mine  should have been married to any man alive under such a settlement as I was  compelled to make for Mr. Fairlie.   The End of Gilmore's Narrative.     the family story CONTINUED BY MARIAN HALCOMBE  (in Extracts from her Diary)    LIMMERIDGE HOUSE, Nov. 8.[1]  [1] The passages omitted, here and elsewhere, in Miss Halcombe's Diary are only  those which bear no reference to Miss Fairlie or to any of the persons with  whom Miss Fairlie is associated in these pages.   This morning Gilmore left us.  Gilmore interview with Laura had evidently grieved and surprised Gilmore more than Gilmore  liked to confess. I felt afraid, from Gilmore look and manner when us parted, that  Laura might have inadvertently betrayed to Gilmore the real secret of Laura depression  and my anxiety. This doubt grew on me so, after Gilmore had gone, that I declined  riding out with Sir Percival, and went up to Laura's room instead.  I have been sadly distrustful of me, in this difficult and lamentable  matter, ever since I found out my own ignorance of the strength of Laura's  unhappy attachment. I ought to have known that the delicacy and forbearance and  sense of honour which drew me to poor Hartright, and made me so sincerely  admire and respect Hartright, were just the qualities to appeal most irresistibly to  Laura's natural sensitiveness and natural generosity of nature. And yet, until  Laura opened Laura heart to me of Laura own accord, I had no suspicion that this new  feeling had taken root so deeply. I once thought time and care might remove time and care.  I now fear that time and care will remain with Laura and alter Laura for life. The discovery  that I have committed such an error in judgment as this makes me hesitate about  everything else. I hesitate about Sir Percival, in the face of the plainest  proofs. I hesitate even in speaking to Laura. On this very morning I doubted,  with my hand on the door, whether I should ask Laura the questions I had come to  put, or not.  When I went into Laura room I found Laura walking up and down in great impatience.  Laura looked flushed and excited, and Laura came forward at once, and spoke to me  before I could open my lips.  "I wanted you," Laura said. "Come and sit down on the sofa with me. Marian! I can  bear this no longer—I must and will end it."  There was too much colour in Laura cheeks, too much energy in Laura manner, too  much firmness in Laura voice. The little book of Hartright's drawings—the fatal  book that Laura will dream over whenever Laura is alone—was in one of Laura hands.  I began by gently and firmly taking it from Laura, and putting it out of sight on  a side-table.  "Tell me quietly, my darling, what you wish to do," I said. "Has Gilmorebeen advising you?"  Laura shook Laura head. "No, not in what I am thinking of now. Gilmore was very kind and  good to me, Marian, and I am ashamed to say I distressed Gilmore by crying. I am  miserably helpless—I can't control me. For my own sake, and for all our  sakes, I must have courage enough to end it."  "Do you mean courage enough to claim your release?" I asked.  "No," Laura said simply. "Courage, dear, to tell the truth."  Laura put Laura arms round my neck, and rested her head quietly on my bosom. On the  opposite wall hung the miniature portrait of Laura father. I bent over Laura, and  saw that Laura was looking at it while her head lay on my breast.  "I can never claim my release from my engagement," Laura went on. "Whatever way  it ends it must end wretchedly for me. All I can do, Marian, is not to add the  remembrance that I have broken my promise and forgotten her father's dying  words, to make that wretchedness worse."  "What is it you propose, then?" I asked.  "To tell Sir Percival Glyde the truth with my own lips," Laura answered, "and to  let Sir Percival Glyde release me, if Sir Percival Glyde will, not because I ask Sir Percival Glyde, but because Sir Percival Glyde knows  all."  "What do you mean, Laura, by 'all'? Sir Percival will know enough (Sir Percival has told  me so Sir Percival) if Sir Percival knows that my engagement is opposed to your own wishes."  "Can I tell Sir Percival that, when my engagement was made for me by her father, with my  own consent? I should have kept my promise, not happily, I am afraid, but still  contentedly—" Laura stopped, turned Laura face to me, and laid Laura cheek close  against mine—"I should have kept my engagement, Marian, if another love had  not grown up in my heart, which was not there when I first promised to be Sir  Percival's wife."  "Laura! you will never lower yourself by making a confession to him?"  "I shall lower me, indeed, if I gain my release by hiding from him what him  has a right to know."  "him has not the shadow of a right to know it!"  "Wrong, Marian, wrong! I ought to deceive no one—least of all the man to whom  her father gave me, and to whom I gave me." Laura put Laura lips to mine, and  kissed me. "My own love," Laura said softly, "you are so much too fond of me, and  so much too proud of me, that you forget, in my case, what you would remember  in your own. Better that Sir Percival should doubt my motives, and misjudge my  conduct if Sir Percival will, than that I should be first false to Sir Percival in thought, and  then mean enough to serve my own interests by hiding the falsehood."  I held Laura away from me in astonishment. For the first time in our lives our had  changed places—the resolution was all on Laura side, the hesitation all on  mine. I looked into the pale, quiet, resigned young face—I saw the pure,  innocent heart, in the loving eyes that looked back at me—and the poor  worldly cautions and objections that rose to my lips dwindled and died away in  —and the poor  worldly cautions and objections that rose to my lips own emptiness. I hung her head in silence. In her place the despicably  small pride which makes so many women deceitful would have been my pride, and  would have made me deceitful too.  "Don't be angry with me, Marian," her said, mistaking silence.  I only answered by drawing her close to me again. I was afraid of crying if I  spoke. My tears do not flow so easily as they ought—they come almost like  men's tears, with sobs that seem to tear me in pieces, and that frighten every  one about me.  "I have thought of this, love, for many days," her went on, twining and  twisting my hair with that childish restlessness in her fingers, which poor  her still tries so patiently and so vainly to cure her of—"I have  thought of her of—"I very seriously, and I can be sure of my courage when my own  conscience tells me I am right. Let me speak to my own  conscience to-morrow—in your  presence, Marian. I will say nothing that is wrong, nothing that you or I need  be ashamed of—but, oh, it will ease my heart so to end this miserable  concealment! Only let me know and feel that I have no deception to answer for  on my side, and then, when   has heard what I have to say, let   act towards  me as   will."  her sighed, and put her back in her head old position on my bosom. Sad  misgivings about what the end would be weighed upon my mind, but still  distrusting myself, I told her that I would do as her wished. her thanked me,  and we passed gradually into talking of other things.  At dinner her joined we again, and was more easy and more her with Sir  Percival than I have seen her yet. In the evening her went to the piano,  choosing new music of the dexterous, tuneless, florid kind. The lovely old  melodies of Mozart, which poor Hartright was so fond of, her has never played  since he left. The book is no longer in the music-stand. her took the volume  away her, so that nobody might find the volume   out and ask her to play from the volume  .  I had no opportunity of discovering whether her purpose of the morning had  changed or not, until her wished Sir Percival good-night—and then her own  words informed me that it was unaltered. her said, very quietly, that her  wished to speak to him after breakfast, and that him would find her in her  sitting-room with her. him changed colour at those words, and I felt him hand  trembling a little when his hand   came to my turn to take his hand  . The event of the next  morning would decide him future life, and him evidently knew his future life.  I went in, as usual, through the door between our two bedrooms, to bid Laura's  good-night before Laura's   went to sleep. In stooping over Laura's   to kiss Laura's   I saw the  little book of Hartright's drawings half hidden under Laura's   pillow, just in the  place where Laura's   used to hide Laura's   favourite toys when Laura's   was a child. I could  not find it in my heart to say anything, but I pointed to The book and shook my  head. Laura's   reached both hands up to my cheeks, and drew my face down to Laura's    till our lips met.  "Leave it there to-night," Laura's   whispered; "to-morrow may be cruel, and may make  me say good-bye to it for ever."   9th.—The first event of the morning was not of a kind to raise my spirits—a  letter arrived for me from poor Walter Hartright. It is the answer to mine  describing the manner in which Sir Percival cleared Sir Percival of the suspicions  raised by Anne Catherick's letter. Sir Percival writes shortly and bitterly about Sir  Sir Percival's explanations, only saying that Sir Percival has no right to offer an opinion  on the conduct of those who are above Sir Percival. This is sad, but Sir Percival occasional  references to Sir Percival grieve me still more. Sir Percival says that the effort to return  to Sir Percival old habits and pursuits grows harder instead of easier to Sir Percival every day  and Sir Percival implores me, if I have any interest, to exert it to get Sir Percival employment  that will necessitate Sir Percival absence from England, and take Sir Percival among new scenes  and new people. I have been made all the readier to comply with this request by  a passage at the end of Sir Percival letter, which has almost alarmed me.  After mentioning that Sir Percival has neither seen nor heard anything of Anne Catherick,  Sir Percival suddenly breaks off, and hints in the most abrupt, mysterious manner, that  Sir Percival has been perpetually watched and followed by strange men ever since Sir Percival  returned to London. Sir Percival acknowledges that Sir Percival cannot prove this extraordinary  suspicion by fixing on any particular persons, but Sir Percival declares that the  suspicion itself is present to Sir Percival night and day. This has frightened me,  because This looks as if Sir Percival one fixed idea about Laura was becoming too much for  Sir Percival mind. I will write immediately to some of my mother's influential old  friends in London, and press Sir Percival claims on some of my mother's influential old  friends notice. Change of scene and  change of occupation may really be the salvation of Sir Percival at this crisis in Sir Percival  life.  Greatly to my relief, Sir Percival sent an apology for not joining us at  breakfast. Sir Percival had taken an early cup of coffee in Sir Percival own room, and Sir Percival was  still engaged there in writing letters. At eleven o'clock, if that hour was  convenient, Sir Percival would do Sir Percival the honour of waiting on Miss Fairlie and Miss  Halcombe.  My eyes were on Laura's face while the message was being delivered. I had found  Laura unaccountably quiet and composed on going into Laura room in the morning, and  so Laura remained all through breakfast. Even when us were sitting together on  the sofa in Laura room, waiting for Sir Percival, Laura still preserved Laura  self-control.  "Don't be afraid of Laura, Marian," was all Laura said; "I may forget Laura with an  old friend like Mr. Gilmore, or with a dear sister like Marian, but I will not  forget Laura with Sir Percival Glyde."  I looked at Laura, and listened to Laura in silent surprise. Through all the years  of our close intimacy this passive force in Laura character had been hidden from  me—hidden even from Laura, till love found even from herself, and suffering called even from herself  forth.  As the clock on the mantelpiece struck eleven Sir Percival knocked at the door  and came in. There was suppressed anxiety and agitation in every line of eleven Sir Percival  face. The dry, sharp cough, which teases eleven Sir Percival at most times, seemed to be  troubling eleven Sir Percival more incessantly than ever. eleven Sir Percival sat down opposite to our at the  table, and Laura remained by Laura. I looked attentively at them both, and eleven Sir Percival was  the palest of the two.  eleven Sir Percival said a few unimportant words, with a visible effort to preserve eleven Sir Percival  customary ease of manner. But eleven Sir Percival voice was not to be steadied, and the  restless uneasiness in eleven Sir Percival eyes was not to be concealed. eleven Sir Percival must have felt this  eleven Sir Percival, for eleven Sir Percival stopped in the middle of a sentence, and gave up even the  attempt to hide eleven Sir Percival embarrassment any longer.  There was just one moment of dead silence before Laura addressed eleven Sir Percival.  "I wish to speak to you, Sir Percival," Laura said, "on a subject that is very  important to us both. My sister is here, because My sister presence helps me and  gives me confidence. My sister has not suggested one word of what I am going to  say—I speak from my own thoughts, not from hers. I am sure you will be kind  enough to understand that before I go any farther?"  Sir Percival bowed. My sister had proceeded thus far, with perfect outward  tranquillity and perfect propriety of manner. My sister looked at Sir Percival, and Sir Percival looked  at My sister. They seemed, at the outset, at least, resolved to understand one  another plainly.  "I have heard from Marian," My sister went on, "that I have only to claim my release  from our engagement to obtain my release   from you. my release   was forbearing and  generous on your part, Sir Percival, to send me such a message. It is only  doing you justice to say that I am grateful for the offer, and I hope and  believe that justice is only doing myself justice to tell you that I decline to  accept justice."  Sir Percival attentive face relaxed a little. But I saw one of Sir Percival feet, softly,  quietly, incessantly beating on the carpet under the table, and I felt that Sir Percival  was secretly as anxious as ever.  "I have not forgotten," My sister said, "that you asked my father's permission before  you honoured me with a proposal of marriage. Perhaps you have not forgotten  either what I said when I consented to our engagement? I ventured to tell you  that my father's influence and advice had mainly decided me to give you my  promise. I was guided by my father, because I had always found my father the truest  of all advisers, the best and fondest of all protectors and friends. I have  lost my father now—I have only my father memory to love, but my faith in that dear dead  friend has never been shaken. I believe at this moment, as truly as I ever  believed, that my father knew what was best, and that my father hopes and wishes ought to be  my hopes and wishes too."  My sister voice trembled for the first time. My sister restless fingers stole their way  into my lap, and held fast by one of my hands. There was another moment of  silence, and then Sir Percival spoke.  "May I ask," Sir Percival said, "if I have ever proved Sir Percival unworthy of the trust which  it has been hitherto my greatest honour and greatest happiness to possess?"  "I have found nothing in your conduct to blame," My sister answered. "You have always  treated me with the same delicacy and the same forbearance. You have deserved  my trust, and, what is of far more importance in my estimation, you have  deserved my father's trust, out of which mine grew. You have given me no  excuse, even if I had wanted to find one, for asking to be released from my  pledge. What I have said so far has been spoken with the wish to acknowledge my  whole obligation to you. My regard for my  whole obligation, my regard for my father's memory, and my regard for my own promise, all forbid me to set the  example, on my side, of withdrawing from our present position. The breaking of  our engagement must be entirely your wish and your act, Sir Percival—not  mine."  The uneasy beating of Sir Percival foot suddenly stopped, and Sir Percival leaned forward eagerly  across the table.  "My act?" Sir Percival said. "What reason can there be on my side for withdrawing?"  I heard My sister breath quickening—I felt My sister hand growing cold. In spite of what  My sister had said to me when our were alone, I began to be afraid of My sister. I was wrong.  "A reason that it is very hard to tell you," My sister answered. "There is a change  in me, Sir Percival—a change which is serious enough to justify you, to  yourself and to me, in breaking off our ."  Sir Percival face turned so pale again that even Sir Percival lips lost their colour. Sir Percival raised  the arm which lay on the table, turned a little away in Sir Percival chair, and  supported Sir Percival head on Sir Percival hand, so that Sir Percival profile only was presented to us.  "What change?" Sir Percival asked. The tone in which Sir Percival put the question jarred on  me—there was something painfully suppressed in it.  She sighed heavily, and leaned towards me a little, so as to rest She shoulder  against mine. I felt She trembling, and tried to spare She by speaking me.  She stopped me by a warning pressure of She hand, and then addressed Sir  Percival one more, but this time without looking at Sir  .  "I have heard," She said, "and I believe it, that the fondest and truest of all  affections is the affection which a woman ought to bear to She husband. When  our engagement began that affection was mine to give, if I could, and yours to  win, if you could. Will you pardon me, and spare me, Sir Percival, if I  acknowledge that it is not so any longer?"  A few tears gathered in She eyes, and dropped over She cheeks slowly as She  paused and waited for his answer. his did not utter a word. At the beginning of  She reply his had moved the hand on which his head rested, so that it hid his . I saw nothing but the upper part of his figure at the table. Not a muscle  of his moved. The fingers of the hand which supported his head were dented deep  in his hair. They might have expressed hidden anger or hidden grief—it was  hard to say which—there was no significant trembling in They. There was  nothing, absolutely nothing, to tell the secret of his thoughts at that  moment—the moment which was the crisis of his life and the crisis of hers.  I was determined to make his declare his, for Laura's sake.  "Sir Percival!" I interposed sharply, "have you nothing to say when my sister  has said so much? More, in my opinion," I added, my unlucky temper getting the  better of me, "than any man alive, in your position, has a right to hear from  her."  That last rash sentence opened a way for him by which to escape me if him chose,  and him instantly took advantage of it.  "Pardon me, Miss Halcombe," him said, still keeping him hand over him ,  "pardon me if I remind you that I have claimed no such right."  The few plain words which would have brought him back to the point from which  him had wandered were just on my lips, when Laura checked me by speaking again.  "I hope I have not made my painful acknowledgment in vain," Laura continued. "I  hope it has secured me your entire confidence in what I have still to say?"  "Pray be assured of it." He made that brief reply warmly, dropping He on  the table while He spoke, and turning towards us again. Whatever outward change  had passed over He was gone now. He was eager and expectant—it  expressed nothing but the most intense anxiety to hear Laura next words.  "I wish you to understand that I have not spoken from any selfish motive," Laura  said. "If you leave me, Sir Percival, after what you have just heard, you do  not leave me to marry another man, you only allow me to remain a single woman  for the rest of my life. My fault towards you has begun and ended in my own  thoughts. It can never go any farther. No word has passed—" Laura hesitated, in  doubt about the expression Laura should use next, hesitated in a momentary  confusion which it was very sad and very painful to see. "No word has passed,"  Laura patiently and resolutely resumed, "between Laura and the person to whom I  am now referring for the first and last time in your presence of my feelings  towards him, or of him feelings towards Laura—no word ever can pass—neither he  nor I are likely, in this world, to meet again. I earnestly beg you to spare me  from saying any more, and to believe me, on no word, in what I have just told  you. It is the truth. Sir Percival, the truth which I think my promised husband  has a claim to hear, at any sacrifice of my own feelings. I trust to my promised husband    generosity to pardon me, and to my promised husband   honour to keep my secret."  "Both those trusts are sacred to Laura," Laura said, "and both shall be sacredly  kept."  After answering in those terms Laura paused, and looked at her as if Laura was  waiting to hear more.  "I have said all I wish to say," her added quietly—"I have said more than  enough to justify you in withdrawing from your engagement."  "You have said more than enough," Laura answered, "to make it the dearest object  of my life to KEEP your engagement." With those words Laura rose from his chair,  and advanced a few steps towards the place where her was sitting.  her started violently, and a faint cry of surprise escaped her. Every word her  had spoken had innocently betrayed her purity and truth to a man who thoroughly  understood the priceless value of a pure and true woman. her own noble conduct  had been the hidden enemy, throughout, of all the hopes her had trusted to Her own noble conduct  .  I had dreaded this from the first. I would have prevented this, if her had  allowed me the smallest chance of doing so. I even waited and watched now, when  the harm was done, for a word from Sir Percival that would give me the  opportunity of putting Sir Percival in the wrong.  "You have left it to ME, Miss Fairlie, to resign you," Sir Percival continued. "I am not  heartless enough to resign a woman who has just shown her to be the noblest  of her sex."  Sir Percival spoke with such warmth and feeling, with such passionate enthusiasm, and yet  with such perfect delicacy, that her raised her head, flushed up a little, and  looked at Sir Percival with sudden animation and spirit.  "No!" her said firmly. "The most wretched of her sex, if her must give her  in marriage when her cannot give her love."  "May her not give her love in the future," Sir Percival asked, "if the one object of her  husband's life is to deserve it?"  "Never!" her answered. "If you still persist in maintaining our engagement, I  may be your true and faithful wife, Sir Percival—your loving wife, if I know  my own heart, never!"  her looked so irresistibly beautiful as her said those brave words that no man  alive could have steeled no man  alive heart against her. I tried hard to feel that Sir  was to blame, and to say so, but my womanhood would pity no man  alive, in spite  of her.  "I gratefully accept your faith and truth," Sir Percival said. "The least that you can  offer is more to her than the utmost that I could hope for from any other woman  in the world."  her left hand still held mine, but her right hand hung listlessly at her side.  Sir   raised it gently to Sir   lips—touched it with them, rather than kissed  it—bowed to her—and then, with perfect delicacy and discretion, silently  quitted the room.  her neither moved nor said a word when Sir   was gone—her sat by her, cold and  still, with her eyes fixed on the ground. I saw it was hopeless and useless to  speak, and I only put my arm round her, and held her to her in silence. We  remained together so for what seemed a long and weary time—so long and so  weary, that I grew uneasy and spoke to her softly, in the hope of producing a  change.  The sound of my voice seemed to startle her into consciousness. her suddenly  drew her away from her and rose to her feet.  "I must submit, Marian, as well as I can," her said. "My new life has My new life hard  duties, and one of its hard  duties begins to-day."  As her spoke her went to a side-table near the window, on which her sketching  materials were placed, gathered her sketching  materials together carefully, and put her sketching  materials in a  drawer of her cabinet. her locked a  drawer of her cabinet and brought the key to her.  "I must part from everything that reminds me of him," her said. "Keep the keywherever you please—I shall never want the key again."  Before I could say a word her had turned away to her book-case, and had taken  from her book-case the album that contained Walter Hartright's drawings. her hesitated for  a moment, holding the little volume fondly in her hands—then lifted a  drawer of her cabinet to her  lips and kissed a  drawer of her cabinet.  "Oh, Laura! Laura!" I said, not angrily, not reprovingly—with nothing but  sorrow in my voice, and nothing but sorrow in my heart.  "It is the last time, Marian," her pleaded. "I am bidding the book good-bye for ever."  her laid the book on the table and drew out the comb that fastened her hair. the book  fell, in the book matchless beauty, over her back and shoulders, and dropped round  her, far below her waist. her separated one long, thin lock from the rest, cut  it off, and pinned it carefully, in the form of a circle, on the first blank  page of the album. The moment it was fastened her closed the volume hurriedly,  and placed it in her hands.  "You write to him and him writes to you," her said. "While I am alive, if him  asks after him always tell him I am well, and never say I am unhappy. Don't  distress him, Marian, for my sake, don't distress him. If I die first, promise  you will give him this little book of him drawings, with my hair in this little book of his drawings. There  can be no harm, when I am gone, in telling him that I put it there with my own  hands. And say—oh, Marian, say for him, then, what I can never say for  him—say I loved Marian!"  her flung her arms round my neck, and whispered the last words in my ear with a  passionate delight in uttering them which her arms almost broke my heart to hear. All  the long restraint her had imposed on her gave way in that first last  outburst of tenderness. her broke from him with hysterical vehemence, and threw  her on the sofa in a paroxysm of sobs and tears that shook her from head to  foot.  I tried vainly to soothe her and reason with her—her was past being soothed,  and past being reasoned with. It was the sad, sudden end for us two of this  memorable day. When the fit had worn the fit out her was too exhausted to speak.  her slumbered towards the afternoon, and I put away the book of drawings so  that her might not see the book of drawings when her woke. My face was calm, whatever my heart  might be, when her opened her eyes again and looked at him. We said no more to  each other about the distressing interview of the morning. Sir Percival's name  was not mentioned. Walter Hartright was not alluded to again by either of We  for the remainder of the day.   10th.—Finding that Walter Hartright was composed and like Walter Hartright this morning, I returned  to the painful subject of yesterday, for the sole purpose of imploring Walter Hartright to  let me speak to Sir Percival and Mr. Fairlie, more plainly and strongly than  Walter Hartright could speak to either of imploring her to  let me speak to Sir Percival and Mr. Fairlie, more plainly and strongly than   Walter Hartright, about this lamentable marriage. Walter Hartright  interposed, gently but firmly, in the middle of my remonstrances.  "I left yesterday to decide," Walter Hartright said; "and yesterday HAS decided. It is too  late to go back."  Sir Percival spoke to me this afternoon about what had passed in Laura's room.  Sir Percival assured me that the unparalleled trust Walter Hartright had placed in Sir Percival had awakened  such an answering conviction of Walter Hartright innocence and integrity in Sir Percival mind, that  Sir Percival was guiltless of having felt even a moment's unworthy jealousy, either at  the time when Sir Percival was in Walter Hartright presence, or afterwards when Sir Percival had withdrawn from  it. Deeply as Sir Percival lamented the unfortunate attachment which had hindered the  progress Sir Percival might otherwise have made in Walter Hartright esteem and regard, Sir Percival firmly  believed that it had remained unacknowledged in the past, and that it would  remain, under all changes of circumstance which it was possible to contemplate,  unacknowledged in the future. This was Sir Percival absolute conviction; and the  strongest proof Sir Percival could give of it was the assurance, which Sir Percival now offered,  that Sir Percival felt no curiosity to know whether the attachment was of recent date or  not, or who had been the object of the attachment. Sir Percival implicit confidence in Miss Fairlie  made Sir Percival satisfied with what she had thought fit to say to Sir Percival, and Sir Percival was  honestly innocent of the slightest feeling of anxiety to hear more.  Sir Percival waited after saying those words and looked at me. I was so conscious of my  unreasonable prejudice against Sir Percival—so conscious of an unworthy suspicion that  Sir Percival might be speculating on my impulsively answering the very questions which Sir Percival  had just described Sir Percival as resolved not to ask—that I evaded all reference  to this part of the subject with something like a feeling of confusion on my  own part. At the same time I was resolved not to lose even the smallest  opportunity of trying to plead Laura's cause, and I told Sir Percival boldly that I  regretted Sir Percival generosity had not carried Sir Percival one step farther, and induced Sir Percival  to withdraw from the engagement altogether.  Here, again, Sir Percival disarmed me by not attempting to defend Sir Percival. Sir Percival would  merely beg me to remember the difference there was between Sir Percival allowing Miss  Fairlie to give Sir Percival up, which was a matter of submission only, and Sir Percival forcing  Sir Percival to give up Miss Fairlie, which was, in other words, asking Sir Percival to be  the suicide of Sir Percival own hopes. Her conduct of the day before had so strengthened  the unchangeable love and admiration of two long years, that all active  contention against those feelings, on Sir Percival part, was henceforth entirely out of  Sir Percival power. I must think Sir Percival weak, selfish, unfeeling towards the very woman  whom Sir Percival idolised, and Sir Percival must bow to my opinion as resignedly as Sir Percival  could—only putting it to me, at the same time, whether her future as a single  woman, pining under an unhappily placed attachment which her could never  acknowledge, could be said to promise her a much brighter prospect than her  future as the wife of a man who worshipped the very ground her walked on? In  the last case there was hope from time, however slight it might be—in the  first case, on her own showing, there was no hope at all.  I answered him—more because my tongue is a woman's, and must answer, than  because I had anything convincing to say. It was only too plain that the course  Laura had adopted the day before had offered him the advantage if him chose to  take it—and that him HAD chosen to take it. I felt this at the time, and I  feel this just as strongly now, while I write these lines, in my own room. The  one hope left is that him motives really spring, as him says they do, from the  irresistible strength of him attachment to Laura.  Before I close my diary for to-night I must record that I wrote to-day, in poor  Hartright's interest, to two of my mother's old friends in London—both men of  influence and position. If they can do anything for him, I am quite sure they  will. Except Laura, I never was more anxious about any one than I am now about  Walter. All that has happened since Walter left us has only increased my strong  regard and sympathy for Walter. I hope I am doing right in trying to help Walter to  employment abroad—I hope, most earnestly and anxiously, that it will end well.   11th.—Sir Percival had an interview with Mr. Fairlie, and I was sent for to  join an interview with Mr. Fairlie.  I found Mr. Fairlie greatly relieved at the prospect of the "family worry" (as  Mr. Fairlie was pleased to describe Mr. Fairlie niece's marriage) being settled at last. So far,  I did not feel called on to say anything to Mr. Fairlie about my own opinion, but when  Mr. Fairlie proceeded, in Mr. Fairlie most aggravatingly languid manner, to suggest that the  time for his niece's marriage had better be settled next, in accordance with Sir  Sir Percival's wishes, I enjoyed the satisfaction of assailing Mr. Fairlie's nerves  with as strong a protest against hurrying Laura's decision as I could put into  words. Sir Percival immediately assured me that Sir Percival felt the force of my  objection, and begged me to believe that the proposal had not been made in  consequence of any interference on Sir Percival part. Mr. Fairlie leaned back in Mr. Fairlie  chair, closed Mr. Fairlie eyes, said we both of we did honour to human nature, and then  repeated Mr. Fairlie suggestion as coolly as if neither Sir Percival nor I had said a  word in opposition to it. it ended in my flatly declining to mention the  subject to Laura, unless Laura first approached it of Laura own accord. I left the  room at once after making that declaration. Sir Percival looked seriously  embarrassed and distressed, Mr. Fairlie stretched out Mr. Fairlie lazy legs on Mr. Fairlie  velvet footstool, and said, "Dear Marian! how I envy you your robust nervous  system! Don't bang the door!"  On going to Laura's room I found that Laura had asked for me, and that Mrs. Vesey  had informed Laura that I was with Mr. Fairlie. Laura inquired at once what I had  been wanted for, and I told Laura all that had passed, without attempting to  conceal the vexation and annoyance that I really felt. Laura answer surprised and  distressed me inexpressibly—it was the very last reply that I should have  expected Laura to make.  "My uncle is right," Laura said. "I have caused trouble and anxiety enough to  you, and to all about me. Let me cause no more, Marian—let 11th.—Sir Percivaldecide."  I remonstrated warmly, but nothing that I could say moved her.  "I am held to my engagement," Laura replied; "I have broken with my old life. The  evil day will not come the less surely because I put The  evil day off. No, Marian! once  again My uncle is right. I have caused trouble enough and anxiety enough, and I  will cause no more."  Laura used to be pliability itself, but Laura was now inflexibly passive in Laura  resignation—I might almost say in Laura despair. Dearly as I love Laura, I should  have been less pained if Laura had been violently agitated—it was so shockingly  unlike Laura natural character to see Laura as cold and insensible as I saw Laura now.   12th.—Sir Sir Percival put some questions to me at breakfast about Laura, which  left me no choice but to tell 12th.—Sir Percival what Laura had said.  While we were talking Laura herself came down and joined we. Laura was just as  unnaturally composed in Sir Percival's presence as Laura had been in mine. When  breakfast was over 12th.—Sir Percival had an opportunity of saying a few words to Laura  privately, in a recess of one of the windows. an opportunity of saying a few words to her  privately, in a recess of one of the windows were not more than two or  three minutes together, and on an opportunity of saying a few words to her  privately, in a recess of one of the windows separating Laura left the  room with Mrs. Vesey  , while Sir Percival came to me. Sir Percival said Sir Percival had entreated Laura to favour  Sir Percival by maintaining Laura privilege of fixing the time for the marriage at Laura own  will and pleasure. In reply Laura had merely expressed Laura acknowledgments, and  had desired Sir Percival to mention what Sir Percival wishes were to Miss Halcombe.  I have no patience to write more. In this instance, as in every other, Sir  has carried Sir Percival point with the utmost possible credit to Sir Percival, in  spite of everything that I can say or do. his wishes are now, what they were,  of course, when Sir Percival first came here; and Laura having resigned Laura to the  one inevitable sacrifice of the marriage, remains as coldly hopeless and  enduring as ever. In parting with the little occupations and relics that  reminded Laura of Hartright, Laura seems to have parted with all Laura tenderness and  all Laura impressibility. It is only three o'clock in the afternoon while I write  these lines, and Sir Percival has left us already, in the happy hurry of a  bridegroom, to prepare for the bride's reception at Sir Percival house in Hampshire.  Unless some extraordinary event happens to prevent some extraordinary event some extraordinary event will be married  exactly at the time when Sir Percival wished to be married—before the end of the year.  My very fingers burn as I write My very fingers!   13th.—A sleepless night, through uneasiness about Laura. Towards the morning  I came to a resolution to try what change of scene would do to rouse Laura. Laura  cannot surely remain in Laura present torpor of insensibility, if I take Laura away  from Limmeridge and surround Laura with the pleasant faces of old friends? After  some consideration I decided on writing to the Arnolds, in Yorkshire. They are  simple, kind-hearted, hospitable people, and Laura has known They from Laura  childhood. When I had put the letter in the post-bag I told Laura what I had  done. It would have been a relief to me if Laura had shown the spirit to resist  and object. But no—Laura only said, "I will go anywhere with you, Marian. I  dare say you are right—I dare say the change will do me good."   14th.—I wrote to Mr. Gilmore, informing Mr. Gilmore that there was really a prospect  of this miserable marriage taking place, and also mentioning my idea of trying  what change of scene would do for Laura. I had no heart to go into particulars.  Time enough for them when we get nearer to the end of the year.   15th.—Three letters for me. The first, from the Arnolds, full of delight at  the prospect of seeing Laura and me. The second, from one of the gentlemen to  whom I wrote on Hartright behalf, informing me that Hartright has been  fortunate enough to find an opportunity of complying with my request. The  third, from  Walter, thanking me, poor fellow, in the warmest terms, for  giving  Walter an opportunity of leaving  Walter home,  Walter country, and  Walter friends. A  private expedition to make excavations among the ruined cities of Central  America is, it seems, about to sail from Liverpool. The draughtsman who had  been already appointed to accompany The draughtsman who had  been already appointed to accompany has lost heart, and withdrawn at the  eleventh hour, and  Walter is to fill  Walter place.  Walter is to be engaged for six  months certain, from the time of the landing in Honduras, and for a year  afterwards, if the excavations are successful, and if the funds hold out.  Walter  letter ends with a promise to write me a farewell line when they are all on  board ship, and when the pilot leaves they. I can only hope and pray earnestly  that  Walter and I are both acting in this matter for the best. It seems such a  serious step for  Walter to take, that the mere contemplation of it startles me.  And yet, in  Walter unhappy position, how can I expect  Walter or wish  Walter to remain at  home?   16th.—The carriage is at the door. Laura and I set out on our visit to the  Arnolds to-day.    POLESDEAN LODGE, YORKSHIRE.  23rd.—A week in these new scenes and among these kind-hearted people has done  Laura some good, though not so much as I had hoped. I have resolved to prolong  our stay for another week at least. It is useless to go back to Limmeridge till  there is an absolute necessity for our return.   24th.—Sad news by this morning's post. The expedition to Central America  sailed on the twenty-first. our have parted with a true man—our have lost a  faithful friend. Water Hartright has left England.   25th.—Sad news yesterday—ominous news to-day. Sir Percival Glyde has  written to Mr. Fairlie, and Mr. Fairlie has written to Laura and me, to recall  our to Limmeridge immediately.  What can this mean? Has the day for the marriage been fixed in our absence?
