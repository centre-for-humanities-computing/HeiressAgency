 I am asked to state plainly what I know of the progress of Miss Halcombe's  illness and of the circumstances under which Lady Glyde left Blackwater Park  for London.
The reason given for making this demand on me is, that my testimony is wanted  in the interests of truth.
As the widow of a clergyman of the Church of England  (reduced by misfortune to the necessity of accepting a situation), I have been  taught to place the claims of truth above all other considerations.
I therefore  comply with a request which I might otherwise, through reluctance to connect  me with distressing family affairs, have hesitated to grant.
I made no memorandum at the time, and I cannot therefore be sure to a day of  the date, but I believe I am correct in stating that Miss Halcombe's  's serious  illness began during the last fortnight or ten days in June.
The breakfast hour  was late at Blackwater Park—sometimes as late as ten, never earlier than  half-past nine.
On the morning to which I am now referring, Miss Halcombe (who  was usually the first to come down) did not make Miss Halcombe (who  was usually the first to come down) appearance at the table.
After the family had waited a quarter of an hour, the upper housemaid was sent  to see after the upper housemaid, and came running out of the room dreadfully frightened.
I met  the servant on the stairs, and went at once to Miss Halcombe's   to see what was  the matter.
the upper housemaid was incapable of telling me.
the upper housemaid was walking about  the upper housemaid room with a pen in the upper housemaid hand, quite light-headed, in a state of burning  fever.
Lady Glyde (being no longer in Sir Percival's service, I may, without  impropriety, mention my former mistress by the upper housemaid name, instead of calling the upper housemaid my  lady) was the first to come in from the upper housemaid own bedroom.
the upper housemaid was so dreadfully  alarmed and distressed that the upper housemaid was quite useless.
The Count Fosco, and his  lady, who came upstairs immediately afterwards, were both most serviceable and  kind.
the upper housemaid ladyship assisted me to get Miss Halcombe's   Miss Halcombe's   to Her ladyship bed.
His lordship  the Count remained in the sitting-room, and having sent for my medicine-chest,  made a mixture for Miss Halcombe's  , and a cooling lotion to be applied to the upper housemaid  head, so as to lose no time before the doctor came.
We applied a cooling lotion, but  We could not get the upper housemaid to take the mixture.
Sir Percival undertook to send for  the doctor.
Sir Percival despatched a groom, on horseback, for the nearest medical man,  Mr. Dawson, of Oak Lodge.
Sir Percival arrived in less than an hour's time.
Sir Percival was a respectable elderly  man, well known all round the country, and We were much alarmed when We found  that Sir Percival considered the case to be a very serious one.
His lordship   the Count affably entered into conversation with Sir Percival, and  gave Sir Percival opinions with a judicious freedom.
Mr. Dawson, not over-courteously,  inquired if His lordship  's advice was the advice of a doctor, and being  informed that it was the advice of one who had studied medicine  unprofessionally, replied that his was not accustomed to consult with amateur  physicians.
The Count, with truly Christian meekness of temper, smiled and left  the room.
Before his went out his told me that his might be found, in case his was  wanted in the course of the day, at the boat-house on the banks of the lake.
Why his should have gone there, I cannot say.
But his did go, remaining away the  whole day till seven o'clock, which was dinner-time.
Perhaps his wished to set  the example of keeping the boat-house on the banks of the lake as quiet as possible.
It was entirely in his  character to do so.
his was a most considerate nobleman.
Miss Halcombe passed a very bad night, the fever coming and going, and getting  worse towards the morning instead of better.
No nurse fit to wait on No nurse being  at hand in the neighbourhood, No nurse ladyship the Countess and myself undertook  the duty, relieving each other.
Lady Glyde, most unwisely, insisted on sitting  up with us.
No nurse was much too nervous and too delicate in health to bear the  anxiety of Miss Halcombe's illness calmly.
No nurse only did No nurse harm, without  being of the least real assistance.
A more gentle and affectionate lady never  lived—but No nurse cried, and No nurse was frightened, two weaknesses which made No nurse  entirely unfit to be present in a sick-room.
Sir Percival and the Count came in the morning to make Sir Percival and the Count inquiries.
Sir Percival and the Count, at his lady's affliction and at Miss  Halcombe's illness) appeared much confused and unsettled in his mind.
his  lordship testified, on the contrary, a becoming composure and interest.
His  lordship had  His  lordship straw hat in one hand, and His  lordship book in the other, and His  lordship mentioned to Sir  Sir Percival and the CountHis  lordship .
"Let  us keep the house quiet," His  lordship said.
"Let us not smoke indoors, my friend, now  Halcombe is ill. You go your way, and I will go us.
When I study I like  to be alone.
Good-morning, Mrs.
Michelson."
Sir   was not civil enough—perhaps I ought in justice to say, not  composed enough—to take leave of Sir   with the same polite attention.
The only  person in the house, indeed, who treated me, at that time or at any other, on  the footing of a lady in distressed circumstances, was the Count.
the Count had the  manners of a true nobleman—the Count was considerate towards every one.
Even the  young person (Fanny by name) who attended on Lady Glyde was not beneath Even the  young person (Fanny by name) who attended on Lady Glydenotice.
When Even the  young person (Fanny by name) who attended on Lady Glyde was sent away by Sir Percival, Even the  young person (Fanny by name) who attended on Lady Glyde lordship (showing me Even the  young person (Fanny by name) who attended on Lady Glyde  sweet little birds at the time) was most kindly anxious to know what had become  of Even the  young person (Fanny by name) who attended on Lady Glyde, where Even the  young person (Fanny by name) who attended on Lady Glyde was to go the day Even the  young person (Fanny by name) who attended on Lady Glyde left Blackwater Park, and so on.
It is  in such little delicate attentions that the advantages of aristocratic birth  always show the advantages of aristocratic birth  .
I make no apology for introducing these  particulars—the advantages of aristocratic birth   are brought forward in justice to his lordship, whose  character, I have reason to know, is viewed rather harshly in certain quarters.
A nobleman who can respect a lady in distressed circumstances, and can take a  fatherly interest in the fortunes of an humble servant girl, shows principles  and feelings of too high an order to be lightly called in question.
I advance  no opinions—I offer facts only.
My endeavour through life is to judge not  that I be not judged.
One of my beloved husband's finest sermons was on that  text.
I read that   constantly—in my own copy of the edition printed by  subscription, in the first days of my widowhood—and at every fresh perusal I  derive an increase of spiritual benefit and edification.
There was no improvement in Miss Halcombe, and the second night was even worse  than the first.
Mr. Dawson was constant in Mr. Dawson attendance.
The practical duties  of nursing were still divided between the Countess and Mr. Dawson, Lady Glyde  persisting in sitting up with us, though we both entreated Lady Glyde   to take some  rest.
"My place is by Marian's bedside," was Lady Glyde   only answer.
"Whether I am  ill, or well, nothing will induce me to lose sight of I am  ill."  Towards midday I went downstairs to attend to some of my regular duties.
An  hour afterwards, on my way back to the sick-room, I saw the Count (who had gone  out again early, for the third time) entering the hall, to all appearance in  the highest good spirits.
Sir Percival, at the same moment, put Sir Percival head out of  the library door, and addressed Sir Percival noble friend, with extreme eagerness, in  these words—  "Have you found his noble friend?"
His lordship's large face became dimpled all over with placid smiles, but His  made no reply in words.
At the same time Sir Percival turned his head, observed  that I was approaching the stairs, and looked at Sir Percival in the most rudely angry  manner possible.
"Come in here and tell me about it," Sir Percival said to the Count.
"Whenever there are  women in a house women in a house're always sure to be going up or down stairs."
"Sir Percival," observed Sir Percival lordship kindly, "Mrs. Michelson has duties.
Pray recognise Pray admirable performance of them as sincerely as I do!
How is  the sufferer, Mrs.
Michelson?"
"No better, my lord, I regret to say."
"Sad—most sad!"
remarked the Count.
"You look fatigued, "Mrs. Michelson.
It is  certainly time you and my wife had some help in nursing.
I think I may be the  means of offering you some help in nursing.
Circumstances have happened which will oblige  Madame Fosco to travel to London either to-morrow or the day after.
Madame Fosco will go  away in the morning and return at night, and Madame Fosco will bring back with Madame Fosco, to  relieve you, a nurse of excellent conduct and capacity, who is now disengaged.
Madame Fosco is known to my wife as a person to be trusted.
Before Madame Fosco comes here  say nothing about Madame Fosco, if you please, to the doctor, because the doctor will look with  an evil eye on any nurse of my providing.
When Madame Fosco appears in the boat-house on the banks of the lake Madame Fosco  will speak for Madame Fosco, and Mr. Dawson will be obliged to acknowledge that  there is no excuse for not employing Madame Fosco.
Lady Glyde will say the same.
Pray  present my best respects and sympathies to Lady Glyde."
I expressed my grateful acknowledgments for Lady Glyde 's kind consideration.
Sir   cut them short by calling to Sir   noble friend (using, I regret to  say, a profane expression) to come into the library, and not to keep Sir    waiting there any longer.
I proceeded upstairs.
We are poor erring creatures, and however well  established a woman's principles may be she cannot always keep on she guard  against the temptation to exercise an idle curiosity.
I am ashamed to say that  an idle curiosity, on this occasion, got the better of my principles, and made  me unduly inquisitive about the question which Sir Percival had addressed to  Sir Percival noble friend at the library door.
Who was the Count expected to find in the  course of Sir Percival studious morning rambles at Blackwater Park?
A woman, it was to  be presumed, from the terms of Sir Percival's inquiry.
I did not suspect the  Count of any impropriety—I knew his moral character too well.
The only  question I asked myself was—Had his found A woman?
To resume.
The night passed as usual without producing any change for the  better in Miss Halcombe's  .
The next day A woman seemed to improve a little.
The day  after that A woman ladyship the Countess, without mentioning the object of A woman  journey to any one in my hearing, proceeded by the morning train to  London—her noble husband, with her noble husband customary attention, accompanying her to  the station.
I was now left in sole charge of Miss Halcombe's  , with every apparent chance, in  consequence of her sister's resolution not to leave the bedside, of having Lady  Glyde her sister to nurse next.
The only circumstance of any importance that happened in the course of the day  was the occurrence of another unpleasant meeting between the doctor and the  Count.
His lordship  , on returning from the station, stepped up into Miss Halcombe's  sitting-room to make His lordship   inquiries.
I went out from the bedroom to speak to  His lordship  , Mr. Dawson and Lady Glyde being both with the patient at the time.
the  Count asked me many questions about the treatment and the symptoms.
I informed  the  Count that the treatment was of the kind described as "saline," and that the  symptoms, between the attacks of fever, were certainly those of increasing  weakness and exhaustion.
Just as I was mentioning these last particulars, Mr. Dawson came out from the bedroom.
"Good-morning, Sir  ," said Mr. Dawson , stepping forward in the most urbane  manner, and stopping the doctor, with a high-bred resolution impossible to  resist, "I greatly fear you find no improvement in the symptoms to-day?"
"I find decided improvement," answered Mr. Dawson.
"You still persist in your lowering treatment of this case of fever?"
continued  His lordship  .
"I persist in the treatment which is justified by my own professional  experience," said Mr. Dawson.
"Permit me to put one question to you on the vast subject of professional  experience," observed the  Count.
"I presume to offer no more advice—I only  presume to make an inquiry.
You live at some distance, Sir  , from the gigantic  centres of scientific activity—London and Paris.
Have you ever heard of the  wasting effects of fever being reasonably and intelligibly repaired by  fortifying the exhausted patient with brandy, wine, ammonia, and quinine?
Has  that new heresy of the highest medical authorities ever reached your ears—Yes  or No?"
"When a professional man puts that question to a professional man I shall be glad to answer  a professional man," said the doctor, opening the door to go out.
"You are not a professional  man, and I beg to decline answering you."
Buffeted in this inexcusably uncivil way on one cheek, the Count, like a  practical Christian, immediately turned the other, and said, in the sweetest  manner, "Good-morning, Mr.
Dawson."
If my late beloved husband had been so fortunate as to know my late beloved husband , how  highly my late beloved husband and the Count would have esteemed each other!
Her ladyship the Countess returned by the last train that night, and brought  with Her the nurse from London.
I was instructed that this person's name was  Mrs. Rubelle.
Her personal appearance, and Her imperfect English when Her  spoke, informed me that Her was a foreigner.
I have always cultivated a feeling of humane indulgence for foreigners.
foreigners do  not possess foreigners blessings and advantages, and foreigners are, for the most part,  brought up in the blind errors of Popery.
It has also always been my precept  and practice, as It was my dear husband's precept and practice before me (see  Sermon XXIX.
in the Collection by the late Rev.
Samuel Michelson, M.A.
), to do  as I would be done by.
On both these accounts I will not say that Mrs. Rubelle  struck me as being a small, wiry, sly person, of fifty or thereabouts, with a  dark brown or Creole complexion and watchful light grey eyes.
Nor will I  mention, for the reasons just alleged, that I thought Mrs. Rubelle   dress, though it was  of the plainest black silk, inappropriately costly in texture and unnecessarily  refined in trimming and finish, for a person in her position in life.
I should  not like these things to be said of me, and therefore it is my duty not to say  these things to be said of me of Mrs. Rubelle  .
I will merely mention that Mrs. Rubelle   manners were, not perhaps  unpleasantly reserved, but only remarkably quiet and retiring—that Mrs. Rubelle   looked  about Mrs. Rubelle   a great deal, and said very little, which might have arisen quite as  much from Mrs. Rubelle   own modesty as from distrust of Mrs. Rubelle   position at Blackwater Park;  and that Mrs. Rubelle   declined to partake of supper (which was curious perhaps, but  surely not suspicious?
), although I myself politely invited Mrs. Rubelle   to that meal in  my own room.
At the Count's particular suggestion (so like His lordship  's forgiving  kindness!
), it was arranged that Mrs. Rubelle   should not enter on Mrs. Rubelle   duties  until Mrs. Rubelle   had been seen and approved by the doctor the next morning.
I sat up  that night.
Lady Glyde appeared to be very unwilling that the new nurse should  be employed to attend on Miss Halcombe's  .
Such want of liberality towards a  foreigner on the part of a lady of Lady Glyde education and refinement surprised me.
I  ventured to say, "My lady, we must all remember not to be hasty in we  judgments on we inferiors—especially when they come from foreign parts."
Lady Glyde did not appear to attend to me.
Lady Glyde only sighed, and kissed Miss  Halcombe's hand as Halcombe lay on the counterpane.
Scarcely a judicious proceeding  in a sick-room, with a patient whom it was highly desirable not to excite.
But  Lady Glyde Lady Glyde knew nothing of nursing—nothing whatever, I am sorry to say.
The next morning Mrs. Rubelle   was sent to the sitting-room, to be approved by  the doctor on  the doctor way through to the bedroom.
I left Lady Glyde with Miss Halcombe, who was slumbering at the time, and  joined Mrs. Rubelle  , with the object of kindly preventing Lady Glyde from feeling  strange and nervous in consequence of the uncertainty of Lady Glyde situation.
Lady Glyde did  not appear to see it in that light.
Lady Glyde seemed to be quite satisfied,  beforehand, that Mr. Dawson would approve of Lady Glyde, and Lady Glyde sat calmly looking  out of window, with every appearance of enjoying the country air.
Some people  might have thought such conduct suggestive of brazen assurance.
I beg to say  that I more liberally set it down to extraordinary strength of mind.
Instead of  the doctor coming up to us, I was sent for to see  the doctor.
I  thought this change of affairs rather odd, but Mrs. Rubelle   did not appear to  be affected by this change of affairs in any way.
I left Mrs. Rubelle   still calmly looking out of the  window, and still silently enjoying the country air.
Mr. Dawson was waiting for Mr. Dawson by Mr. Dawson in the breakfast-room.
"About this new nurse, Mrs. Michelson," said  the doctor.
"Yes, Sir  ?"
"I find that Mrs. Rubelle   has been brought here from London by the wife of that fat old  foreigner, who is always trying to interfere with Mr. Dawson.
Mrs. Michelson, the fat  old foreigner is a quack."
This was very rude.
I was naturally shocked at it.
"Are you aware, Sir  ," I said, "that you are talking of a nobleman?"
"Pooh!
a nobleman isn't the first quack with a handle to a nobleman name.
They're all  Counts—hang 'em!"
"a nobleman would not be a friend of Sir Percival Glyde's, sir, if a nobleman was not a member  of the highest aristocracy—excepting the English aristocracy, of course."
"Very well, Mrs. Michelson, call a nobleman what you like, and let us get back to the  nurse.
I have been objecting to the  nurse already."
"Without having seen the  nurse, Sir  ?"
"Yes, without having seen the  nurse.
the  nurse may be the best nurse in existence, but the  nurse  is not a nurse of my providing.
I have put that objection to Sir Percival, as  the master of the house.
Sir Percival doesn't support me.
Sir Percival says a nurse of my providing  would have been a stranger from London also, and Sir Percival thinks the  nurse ought to  have a trial, after Sir Percival wife's aunt has taken the trouble to fetch the  nurse from  London.
There is some justice in that, and I can't decently say No.
But I have  made it a condition that the  nurse is to go at once, if I find reason to complain of  the  nurse.
This proposal being one which I have some right to make, as medical  attendant, Sir Percival has consented to it.
Now, Mrs. Michelson, I know I can  depend on Mrs. Michelson, and I want you to keep a sharp eye on the  nurse for the first  day or two, and to see that Mrs. Michelson gives Miss Halcombe's   no medicines but mine.
This  foreign nobleman of yours is dying to try This  foreign nobleman of yours quack remedies (mesmerism  included) on my patient, and a nurse who is brought here by This  foreign nobleman of yours may be a  little too willing to help This  foreign nobleman of yours.
You understand?
Very well, then, we may go  upstairs.
Is the  nurse there?
I'll say a word to the  nurse before the  nurse goes into the  sick-room."
we found Mrs. Rubelle   still enjoying Mrs. Rubelle   at the window.
When I introduced  Mrs. Rubelle   to Mr. Dawson, neither the doctor's doubtful looks nor the doctor's  searching questions appeared to confuse Mrs. Rubelle   in the least.
Mrs. Rubelle   answered him  quietly in Mrs. Rubelle   broken English, and though him tried hard to puzzle Mrs. Rubelle  , Mrs. Rubelle    never betrayed the least ignorance, so far, about any part of Mrs. Rubelle   duties.
This  was doubtless the result of strength of mind, as I said before, and not of  brazen assurance, by any means.
We all went into the bedroom.
Mrs. Rubelle   looked very attentively at the patient, curtseyed to Lady Glyde,  set one or two little things right in the room, and sat down quietly in a  corner to wait until Mrs. Rubelle   was wanted.
Mrs. Rubelle   ladyship seemed startled and annoyed  by the appearance of the strange nurse.
No one said anything, for fear of  rousing Miss Halcombe, who was still slumbering, except the doctor, who  whispered a question about the night.
I softly answered, "Much as usual," and  then Mr. Dawson went out.
Lady Glyde followed Mr. Dawson, I suppose to speak about Mrs. Rubelle  .
For my own part, I had made up my mind already that this quiet  foreign person would keep this quiet  foreign person situation.
this quiet  foreign person had all this quiet  foreign person wits about this quiet  foreign person, and  this quiet  foreign person certainly understood this quiet  foreign person business.
So far, I could hardly have done much  better by the bedside myself.
Remembering Mr. Dawson's caution to me, I subjected Mrs. Rubelle   to a severe  scrutiny at certain intervals for the next three or four days.
I over and over  again entered the room softly and suddenly, but I never found this quiet  foreign person out in any  suspicious action.
Lady Glyde, who watched this quiet  foreign person as attentively as I did,  discovered nothing either.
I never detected a sign of the medicine bottles  being tampered with, I never saw Mrs. Rubelle   say a word to the Count, or the  Count to Mrs. Rubelle  .
Mrs. Rubelle   managed Miss Halcombe's   with unquestionable care and  discretion.
Mrs. Rubelle   wavered backwards and forwards between a sort of  sleepy exhaustion, which was half faintness and half slumbering, and attacks of  fever which brought with them more or less of wandering in Mrs. Rubelle   mind.
Mrs. Rubelle   never disturbed Mrs. Rubelle   in the first case, and never startled Mrs. Rubelle   in the  second, by appearing too suddenly at the bedside in the character of a  stranger.
Honour to whom honour is due (whether foreign or English)—and I  give Mrs. Rubelle   privilege impartially to Mrs. Rubelle  .
Mrs. Rubelle   was remarkably  uncommunicative about Mrs. Rubelle  , and Mrs. Rubelle   was too quietly independent of all  advice from experienced persons who understood the duties of a sick-room—but  with these drawbacks, Mrs. Rubelle   was a good nurse, and Mrs. Rubelle   never gave either Lady  Glyde or Mr. Dawson the shadow of a reason for complaining of Mrs. Rubelle  .
The next circumstance of importance that occurred in the house was the  temporary absence of the Count, occasioned by business which took him to  London.
him went away (I think) on the morning of the fourth day after the  arrival of Mrs. Rubelle  , and at parting him spoke to Lady Glyde very seriously,  in my presence, on the subject of Miss Halcombe's  .
"Trust Mr. Dawson," him said, "for a few days more, if you please.
But if there  is not some change for the better in that time, send for advice from London,  which this mule of a doctor must accept in spite of a doctor.
Offend Mr. Dawson,  and save Miss Halcombe's  .
I say this seriously, on my word of honour and from the  bottom of my heart."
His lordship   spoke with extreme feeling and kindness.
But poor Lady Glyde's  nerves were so completely broken down that poor Lady Glyde's   seemed quite frightened at poor Lady Glyde's  .
poor Lady Glyde's   trembled from head to foot, and allowed poor Lady Glyde's   to take poor Lady Glyde's   leave without  uttering a word on poor Lady Glyde's   side.
poor Lady Glyde's   turned to me when poor Lady Glyde's   had gone, and said, "Oh,  Mrs. Michelson, I am heartbroken about my sister, and I have no friend to  advise me!
Do you think Mr. Dawson is wrong?
Mr. Dawson told me Mr. Dawson this morning  that there was no fear, and no need to send for another doctor."
"With all respect to Mr. Dawson," I answered, "in your ladyship's place I  should remember the Count's advice."
Lady Glyde turned away from me suddenly, with an appearance of despair, for  which I was quite unable to account.
"Mr. Dawson advice!"
Lady Glyde said to Lady Glyde.
"God help us—God advice!"
the Count was away from Blackwater Park, as nearly as I remember, a week.
Sir Percival seemed to feel the loss of His lordship   in various ways, and  appeared also, I thought, much depressed and altered by the sickness and sorrow  in the house.
Occasionally Sir Percival was so very restless that I could not help  noticing it, coming and going, and wandering here and there and everywhere in  the grounds.
Sir Percival inquiries about Miss Halcombe's  , and about Sir Percival lady (whose  failing health seemed to cause Sir Percival sincere anxiety), were most attentive.
I  think Sir Percival heart was much softened.
If some kind clerical friend—some such  friend as Sir Percival might have found in my late excellent husband—had been near Sir Percival  at this time, cheering moral progress might have been made with Sir Percival.
I  seldom find Sir Percival mistaken on a point of this sort, having had experience to  guide me in my happy married days.
Her ladyship the Countess, who was now the only company for Sir Percivaldownstairs, rather neglected Sir Percival, as I considered—or, perhaps, it might have  been that Sir Percival neglected Her.
A stranger might almost have supposed that they  were bent, now they were left together alone, on actually avoiding one another.
This, of course, could not be.
But This did so happen, nevertheless, that the  Countess made the  Countess dinner at luncheon-time, and that the  Countess always came upstairs  towards evening, although Mrs. Rubelle   had taken the nursing duties entirely  off the  Countess hands.
Sir Percival dined by Sir Percival, and William (the man out of  livery) make the remark, in my hearing, that William (the man out of  livery) master had put William (the man out of  livery) on half  rations of food and on a double allowance of drink.
I attach no importance to  such an insolent observation as this on the part of a servant.
I reprobated it  at the time, and I wish to be understood as reprobating it once more on this  occasion.
In the course of the next few days Miss Halcombe's   Miss Halcombe's   did certainly seem to all of  us to be mending a little.
us faith in Mr. Dawson revived.
Mr. Dawson appeared to be  very confident about the case, and Mr. Dawson assured Lady Glyde, when Lady Glyde spoke to Mr. Dawson  on the subject, that Mr. Dawson would Mr. Dawson propose to send for a physician the  moment Mr. Dawson felt so much as the shadow of a doubt crossing Mr. Dawson own mind.
The only person among us who did not appear to be relieved by these words was  the  Countess.
the  Countess said to me privately, that the  Countess could not feel easy about Miss Halcombe's  Halcombe on Mr. Dawson's authority, and that the  Countess should wait anxiously for the  Countess  husband's opinion on her  husband return.
That return, her  husband letters informed the  Countess, would  take place in three days' time.
The Count and Countess corresponded regularly  every morning during His lordship  's absence.
The Count and Countess were in that respect, as in  all others, a pattern to married people.
On the evening of the third day I noticed a change in Miss Halcombe, which  caused me serious apprehension.
Mrs. Rubelle   noticed it too.
We said nothing on  the subject to Lady Glyde, who was then lying asleep, completely overpowered by  exhaustion, on the sofa in the sitting-room.
Mr. Dawson did not pay Mr. Dawson evening visit till later than usual.
As soon as Mr. Dawson  set eyes on Mr. Dawson patient I saw Mr. Dawson face alter.
Mr. Dawson tried to hide his face alter, but Mr. Dawson  looked both confused and alarmed.
A messenger was sent to Mr. Dawson residence for Mr. Dawson  medicine-chest, disinfecting preparations were used in the room, and a bed was  made up for Mr. Dawson in the house by Mr. Dawson own directions.
"Has the fever turned to  infection?"
I whispered to Mr. Dawson.
"I am afraid the fever has," Mr. Dawson answered; "we shall  know better to-morrow morning."
By Mr. Dawson's own directions Lady Glyde was kept in ignorance of this change  for the worse.
He himself absolutely forbade Lady Glyde, on account of Lady Glyde health, to  join us in the bedroom that night.
Lady Glyde tried to resist—there was a sad  scene—but He himself had He himself medical authority to support He himself, and He himself carried He himself  point.
The next morning one of the men-servants was sent to London at eleven o'clock,  with a letter to a physician in town, and with orders to bring the new doctor  back with He himself by the earliest possible train.
Half an hour after the messenger  had gone the Count returned to Blackwater Park.
the  Countess, on the  Countess own responsibility, immediately brought the  Countess in to see the  patient.
There was no impropriety that I could discover in the  Countess taking this  course.
His lordship   was a married man, His lordship   was old enough to be Miss Halcombe's  father, and His lordship   saw the  Countess in the presence of a female relative, Lady Glyde aunt.
Mr. Dawson nevertheless protested against Mr. Dawson presence in the room, but I could  plainly remark the new doctor   was too much alarmed to make any serious resistance  on this occasion.
Mrs. Rubelle   was past knowing any one about Mrs. Rubelle  .
Mrs. Rubelle   seemed to take  Mrs. Rubelle   friends for enemies.
When the Count approached Mrs. Rubelle   bedside Mrs. Rubelle   eyes, which  had been wandering incessantly round and round the room before, settled on the Count  face with a dreadful stare of terror, which I shall remember to my dying day.
the Count sat down by Mrs. Rubelle  , felt Mrs. Rubelle   pulse and Mrs. Rubelle   temples, looked at Mrs. Rubelle   very  attentively, and then turned round upon the new doctor   with such an expression of  indignation and contempt in the Count face, that the words failed on Mr. Dawson's  lips, and the Count stood for a moment, pale with anger and alarm—pale and perfectly  speechless.
the Count looked next at Mr. Dawson's  .
"When did the change happen?"
His lordship   asked.
I told His lordship   the time.
"Has Lady Glyde been in the room since?"
I replied that Lady Glyde had not.
the new doctor   had absolutely forbidden Lady Glyde to come  into the room on the evening before, and had repeated the order again in the  morning.
"Have you and Mrs. Rubelle   been made aware of the full extent of the mischief?"
was Mrs. Rubelle   next question.
We were aware, I answered, that the malady was considered infectious.
Mrs. Rubelle    stopped me before I could add anything more.
"It is typhus fever," Mrs. Rubelle   said.
In the minute that passed, while these questions and answers were going on, Mr. Dawson's   recovered Mr. Dawson's  , and addressed the Count with Mr. Dawson's   customary firmness.
"It is NOT typhus fever," Mr. Dawson's   remarked sharply.
"I protest against this  intrusion, sir.
No one has a right to put questions here but me.
I have done my  duty to the best of my ability—"  the Count interrupted Mr. Dawson's  —not by words, but only by pointing to the bed.
Mr.  seemed to feel that silent contradiction to Mr. Dawson's   assertion of Mr. Dawson's   own  ability, and to grow only the more angry under it.
"I say I have done my  duty," Mr. Dawson's   reiterated.
"A physician has been sent for from London.
I will consult on the nature of the fever with A physician, and with no one  else.
I insist on your leaving the room."
"I entered the room, sir, in the sacred interests of humanity," said the Count.
"And in the same interests, if the coming of A physician is delayed, I  will enter the coming of the physician is delayed again.
I warn you once more that the fever has turned to typhus,  and that your treatment is responsible for this lamentable change.
If that  unhappy lady dies, I will give my testimony in a court of justice that your  ignorance and obstinacy have been the cause of unhappy lady death."
Before Mr. Dawson's   could answer, before the Count could leave us, the door was  opened from the sitting-room, and us saw Lady Glyde on the threshold.
"I MUST and WILL come in," Lady Glyde said, with extraordinary firmness.
Instead of stopping Lady Glyde, the Count moved into the sitting-room, and made way  for Lady Glyde to go in.
On all other occasions the Count was the last man in the world to  forget anything, but in the surprise of the moment the Count apparently forgot the  danger of infection from Typhus, and the urgent necessity of forcing Lady Glydeto take proper care of Lady Glyde.
To my astonishment Mr. Dawson showed more presence of mind.
Mr. Dawson stopped Lady Glyde  ladyship at the first step Lady Glyde took towards the bedside.
"I am sincerely sorry,  I am sincerely grieved," Mr. Dawson said.
"the fever may, I fear, be infectious.
Until  I am certain that it is not, I entreat you to keep out of the sitting-room."
Lady Glyde struggled for a moment, then suddenly dropped Lady Glyde arms and sank forward.
Lady Glyde had fainted.
The Countess and I took Lady Glyde from the doctor and carried Lady Glyde  into the sitting-room.
the Count preceded The Countess and I, and waited in the passage till I came  out and told the Count that The Countess and I had recovered Lady Glyde from the swoon.
I went back to the doctor to tell the doctor, by Lady Glyde desire, that Lady Glyde  insisted on speaking to the doctor immediately.
the doctor withdrew at once to quiet Lady Glyde  ladyship's agitation, and to assure Lady Glyde of A physician's arrival in the  course of a few hours.
Those hours passed very slowly.
Sir Percival and the Count were together downstairs, and sent up from time to time to make Sir Percival and the  Count  inquiries.
At last, between five and six o'clock, to our great relief, the  physician came.
the  physician was a younger man than Mr. Dawson, very serious and very decided.
What the  physician  thought of the previous treatment I cannot say, but he   struck me as curious  that the  physician put many more questions to myself and to Mrs. Rubelle   than the  physician put to  the doctor, and that the  physician did not appear to listen with much interest to what Mr. Dawson's   said, while the  physician was examining Mr. Dawson's patient.
I began to suspect,  from what I observed in this way, that the Count had been right about the  illness all the way through, and I was naturally confirmed in that idea when  Mr. Dawson, after some little delay, asked the one important question which the  London doctor had been sent for to set at rest.
"What is your opinion of the fever?"
the  London doctor inquired.
"Typhus," replied the physician "Typhus fever beyond all doubt."
That quiet foreign person, Mrs. Rubelle, crossed her thin brown hands in front  of her, and looked at myself with a very significant smile.
the Count could  hardly have appeared more gratified if the Count had been present in the sitting-room and had  heard the confirmation of the Count own opinion.
After giving us some useful directions about the management of the patient, and  mentioning that the Count would come again in five days' time, A physician withdrew  to consult in private with Mr. Dawson.
A physician would offer no opinion on Miss  Halcombe's chances of recovery—A physician said it was impossible at that stage of the  illness to pronounce one way or the other.
The five days passed anxiously.
The Countess and I myself took it by turns to relieve Mrs. Rubelle, Miss  Halcombe's condition growing worse and worse, and requiring our utmost care and  attention.
It was a terribly trying time.
Lady Glyde (supported, as Mr. Dawsonsaid, by the constant strain of her suspense on her sister's account) rallied  in the most extraordinary manner, and showed a firmness and determination for  which I should myself never have given her credit.
her insisted on coming into  the sick-room two or three times every day, to look at Halcombe with her  own eyes, promising not to go too close to the bed, if the doctor would consent  to her wishes so far.
Mr. Dawson very unwillingly made the concession required  of Mr. Dawson—I think Mr. Dawson saw that it was hopeless to dispute with her.
her came in  every day, and her self-denyingly kept her promise.
I felt it was hopeless to dispute with her personally so  distressing (as reminding me of my own affliction during my husband's last  illness) to see how her suffered under these circumstances, that I must beg not  to dwell on this part of the subject any longer.
It is more agreeable to myself to  mention that no fresh disputes took place between Mr. Dawson and the Count.
His  lordship made all His  lordship inquiries by deputy, and remained continually in company  with Sir Percival downstairs.
On the fifth day A physician came again and gave us a little hope.
A physician said  the tenth day from the first appearance of Typhus would probably decide the  result of the illness, and A physician arranged for A physician third visit to take place on  that date.
The interval passed as before—except that the Count went to London  again one morning and returned at night.
On the tenth day it pleased a merciful Providence to relieve us household from  all further anxiety and alarm.
A physician positively assured us that Miss  Halcombe was out of danger.
"Halcombe wants no doctor now—all Halcombe requires is  careful watching and nursing for some time to come, and that I see Halcombe has."
Those were his own words.
That evening I read my husband's touching sermon on  Recovery from Sickness, with more happiness and advantage (in a spiritual point  of view) than I ever remember to have derived from it before.
The effect of the good news on Lady Glyde Lady Glyde was, I grieve to say, quite  overpowering.
Lady Glyde was too weak to bear the violent reaction, and in another day  or two Lady Glyde sank into a state of debility and depression which obliged Lady Glyde to  keep Lady Glyde room.
Rest and quiet, and change of air afterwards, were the best  remedies which Mr. Dawson could suggest for Lady Glyde benefit.
It was fortunate that  matters were no worse, for, on the very day after Lady Glyde took to her room, the Count and the doctor had another disagreement—and this time the dispute  between the  Count and the doctor was of so serious a nature that Mr. Dawson left the house.
I was not present at the time, but I understood that the subject of dispute was  the amount of nourishment which it was necessary to give to assist Miss  Halcombe's convalescence after the exhaustion of the fever.
Mr. Dawson, now  that Mr. Dawson patient was safe, was less inclined than ever to submit to  unprofessional interference, and the Count (I cannot imagine why) lost all the  self-control which Mr. Dawson had so judiciously preserved on former occasions, and  taunted the doctor, over and over again, with Mr. Dawson mistake about the fever when  it changed to typhus.
The unfortunate affair ended in Mr. Dawson's appealing to  Sir Percival, and threatening (now that Mr. Dawson could leave without absolute danger  to Halcombe) to withdraw from Mr. Dawson attendance at Blackwater Park if the Count's interference was not peremptorily suppressed from that moment.
Sir  Sir Percival's reply (though not designedly uncivil) had only resulted in making  matters worse, and Mr. Dawson had thereupon withdrawn from the house in a state  of extreme indignation at Count Fosco's usage of Count Fosco's, and had sent in Count Fosco's bill  the next morning.
We were now, therefore, left without the attendance of a medical man.
Although  there was no actual necessity for another doctor—nursing and watching being,  as A physician had observed, all that Halcombe required—I should  still, if my authority had been consulted, have obtained professional  assistance from some other quarter, for form's sake.
The matter did not seem to strike Sir Percival in that light.
Sir Percival said it would  be time enough to send for another doctor if Halcombe showed any signs of  a relapse.
In the meanwhile we had the Count to consult in any minor  difficulty, and we need not unnecessarily disturb we patient in her present  weak and nervous condition by the presence of a stranger at her bedside.
There  was much that was reasonable, no doubt, in these considerations, but these considerations left  me a little anxious nevertheless.
Nor was I quite satisfied in my own mind of  the propriety of we concealing the doctor's absence as we did from Lady Glyde.
It was a merciful deception, I admit—for her was in no state to bear any  fresh anxieties.
But still it was a deception, and, as such, to a person of my  principles, at best a doubtful proceeding.
A second perplexing circumstance which happened on the same day, and which took  me completely by surprise, added greatly to the sense of uneasiness that was  now weighing on my mind.
I was sent for to see Sir Percival in the library.
The Count, who was with Sir Percival  when I went in, immediately rose and left we alone together.
Sir Percivalcivilly asked me to take a seat, and then, to my great astonishment, addressed  me in these terms—  "I want to speak to you, Mrs. Michelson, about a matter which I decided on some  time ago, and which I should have mentioned before, but for the sickness and  trouble in the house.
In plain words, I have reasons for wishing to break up my  establishment immediately at this place—leaving you in charge, of course, as  usual.
As soon as Lady Glyde and Halcombe can travel Lady Glyde and Miss Halcombe can travel must both have  change of air.
My friends, Count Fosco and the Countess, will leave we before  that time to live in the neighbourhood of London, and I have reasons for not  opening the house to any more company, with a view to economising as carefully  as I can.
I don't blame you, but my expenses here are a great deal too heavy.
In short, I shall sell the horses, and get rid of all the servants at once.
I  never do things by halves, as you know, and I mean to have the house clear of a  pack of useless people by this time to-morrow."
I listened to him, perfectly aghast with astonishment.
"Do you mean, Sir Percival, that I am to dismiss all the servants under my  charge without the usual month's warning?"
I asked.
"Certainly I do.
we may all be out of the house before another month, and I am  not going to leave all the servants here in idleness, with no master to wait on."
"Who is to do the cooking, Sir Percival, while you are still staying here?"
"Margaret Porcher can roast and boil—keep Margaret Porcher.
What do I want with a cook if  I don't mean to give any dinner-parties?"
"The servant you have mentioned is the most unintelligent servant in the house,  Sir Percival."
"Keep Margaret Porcher, I tell you, and have a woman in from the village to do the cleaning  and go away again.
My weekly expenses must and shall be lowered immediately.
I  don't send for you to make objections, Mrs. Michelson—I send for you to carry  out my plans of economy.
Dismiss the whole lazy pack of indoor servants  to-morrow, except Margaret Porcher.
Margaret Porcher is as strong as a horse—and we'll make Margaret Porcher  work like a horse."
"You will excuse me for reminding you, Sir Percival, that if all the servants go  to-morrow all the servants must have a month's wages in lieu of a month's warning."
"Let all the servants!
A month's wages saves a month's waste and gluttony in the servants'  hall."
This last remark conveyed an aspersion of the most offensive kind on my  management.
I had too much self-respect to defend myself under so gross an  imputation.
Christian consideration for the helpless position of Miss Halcombe  and Lady Glyde, and for the serious inconvenience which my sudden absence might  inflict on them, alone prevented me from resigning my situation on the spot.
I  rose immediately.
It would have lowered me in my own estimation to have  permitted the interview to continue a moment longer.
"After This last remark, Sir Percival, I have nothing more to say.
Your  directions shall be attended to."
Pronouncing those words, I bowed my head with  the most distant respect, and went out of the room.
The next day all the servants left in a body.
Sir Percival dismissed the  grooms and stablemen, sending the  grooms and stablemen, with all the horses but one, to London.
Of  the whole domestic establishment, indoors and out, there now remained only  myself, Margaret Porcher, and the gardener—this last living in the gardener own  cottage, and being wanted to take care of the one horse that remained in the  stables.
With the house left in this strange and lonely condition—with the mistress of  it ill in her room—with Halcombe still as helpless as a child—and with  the doctor's attendance withdrawn from us in enmity—it was surely not  unnatural that my spirits should sink, and my customary composure be very hard  to maintain.
My mind was ill at ease.
I wished the poor ladies both well again,  and I wished myself away from Blackwater Park.
