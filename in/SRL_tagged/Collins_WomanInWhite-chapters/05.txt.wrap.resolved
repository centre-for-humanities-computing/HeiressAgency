 When I rose the next morning and drew up my blind, the sea opened before me  joyously under the broad August sunlight, and the distant coast of Scotland  fringed the horizon with Scotland   lines of melting blue.  The view was such a surprise, and such a change to me, after my weary London  experience of brick and mortar landscape, that I seemed to burst into a new  life and a new set of thoughts the moment I looked at it. A confused sensation  of having suddenly lost my familiarity with the past, without acquiring any  additional clearness of idea in reference to the present or the future, took  possession of my mind. Circumstances that were but a few days old faded back in  my memory, as if they had happened months and months since. Pesca's quaint  announcement of the means by which he had procured me my present employment;  the farewell evening I had passed with my mother and sister; even my mysterious  adventure on the way home from Hampstead—had all become like events which  might have occurred at some former epoch of my existence. Although the woman in  white was still in my mind, the image of the woman in  white seemed to have grown dull and  faint already.  A little before nine o'clock, I descended to the ground-floor of the house. The  solemn man-servant of the night before met me wandering among the passages, and  compassionately showed me the way to the breakfast-room.  My first glance round me, as the man opened the door, disclosed a  well-furnished breakfast-table, standing in the middle of a long room, with  many windows in it. I looked from the table to the window farthest from me, and  saw a lady standing at the window, with a lady back turned towards me. The instant my eyes  rested on a lady, I was struck by the rare beauty of a lady form, and by the  unaffected grace of a lady attitude. a lady figure was tall, yet not too tall; comely  and well-developed, yet not fat; a lady head set on a lady shoulders with an easy,  pliant firmness; a lady waist, perfection in the eyes of a man, for it occupied  it natural place, it filled out it natural circle, it was visibly and  delightfully undeformed by stays. a lady had not heard my entrance into the room;  and I allowed a lady the luxury of admiring a lady for a few moments, before I  moved one of the chairs near a lady, as the least embarrassing means of attracting  a lady attention. a lady turned towards a lady immediately. The easy elegance of every  movement of a lady limbs and body as soon as a lady began to advance from the far end  of the room, set me in a flutter of expectation to see a lady face clearly. a lady  left the window—and I said to a lady, a lady is dark. a lady moved forward a  few steps—and I said to a lady, a lady is young. a lady approached  nearer—and I said to a lady (with a sense of surprise which words fail me to  express), a lady is ugly!  Never was the old conventional maxim, that Nature cannot err, more flatly  contradicted—never was the fair promise of a lovely figure more strangely and  startlingly belied by the face and head that crowned it. a lady's complexion  was almost swarthy, and the dark down on a lady upper lip was almost a moustache.  a lady had a large, firm, masculine mouth and jaw; prominent, piercing, resolute  brown eyes; and thick, coal-black hair, growing unusually low down on a lady  forehead. a lady expression—bright, frank, and intelligent—appeared, while a lady  was silent, to be altogether wanting in those feminine attractions of  gentleness and pliability, without which the beauty of the handsomest woman  alive is beauty incomplete. To see such a face as this set on shoulders that a  sculptor would have longed to model—to be charmed by the modest graces of  action through which the symmetrical limbs betrayed the symmetrical limbs beauty when the symmetrical limbs  moved, and then to be almost repelled by the masculine form and masculine look  of the features in which the perfectly shaped figure ended—was to feel a  sensation oddly akin to the helpless discomfort familiar to us all in sleep,  when we recognise yet cannot reconcile the anomalies and contradictions of a  dream.  "Mr. Hartright?" said a lady interrogatively, a lady dark face lighting up with  a smile, and softening and growing womanly the moment a lady began to speak. "We  resigned all hope of you last night, and went to bed as usual. Accept my  apologies for We apparent want of attention; and allow me to introduce myself  as one of your pupils. Shall We shake hands? I suppose We must come to it  sooner or later—and why not sooner?"  These odd words of welcome were spoken in a clear, ringing, pleasant voice. The  offered hand—rather large, but beautifully formed—was given to myself with the  easy, unaffected self-reliance of a highly-bred woman. We sat down together at  the breakfast-table in as cordial and customary a manner as if We had known  each other for years, and had met at Limmeridge House to talk over old times by  previous appointment.  "I hope you come here good-humouredly determined to make the best of your  position," continued a lady. "You will have to begin this morning by putting  up with no other company at breakfast than mine. My sister is in My sister own room,  nursing that essentially feminine malady, a slight headache; and My sister old  governess, Mrs. Vesey, is charitably attending on My sister with restorative tea. My  uncle, Mr. Fairlie, never joins We at any of We meals: My  uncle, Mr. Fairlie is an invalid, and  keeps bachelor state in My  uncle, Mr. Fairlie own apartments. There is nobody else in Limmeridge Housebut me. Two young ladies have been staying here, but Two young ladies went away yesterday,  in despair; and no wonder. All through Two young ladies visit (in consequence of Mr.  Fairlie's invalid condition) We produced no such convenience in Limmeridge House as a  flirtable, danceable, small-talkable creature of the male sex; and the  consequence was, We did nothing but quarrel, especially at dinner-time. How can  you expect four women to dine together alone every day, and not quarrel? We are  such fools, We can't entertain each other at table. You see I don't think much  of my own sex, Mr. Hartright—which will you have, tea or coffee?—no woman  does think much of My sister own sex, although few of them confess it as freely as I  do. Dear me, you look puzzled. Why? Are you wondering what you will have for  breakfast? or are you surprised at my careless way of talking? In the first  case, I advise you, as a friend, to have nothing to do with that cold ham at  your elbow, and to wait till the omelette comes in. In the first  case, I will  give you some tea to compose your spirits, and do all a woman can (which is  very little, by-the-bye) to hold my tongue."  all a woman handed me my cup of tea, laughing gaily. all a woman light flow of talk, and all a woman  lively familiarity of manner with a total stranger, were accompanied by an  unaffected naturalness and an easy inborn confidence in all a woman and all a woman  position, which would have secured all a woman the respect of the most audacious man  breathing. While it was impossible to be formal and reserved in all a woman company, it  was more than impossible to take the faintest vestige of a liberty with all a woman,  even in thought. I felt this instinctively, even while I caught the infection  of all a woman own bright gaiety of spirits—even while I did my best to answer all a woman in  all a woman own frank, lively way.  "Yes, yes," all a woman said, when I had suggested the only explanation I could offer,  to account for my perplexed looks, "I understand. You are such a perfect  stranger in the house, that you are puzzled by my familiar references to the  worthy inhabitants. Natural enough: I ought to have thought of it before. At  any rate, I can set it right now. Suppose I begin with all a woman, so as to get  done with that part of the subject as soon as possible? My name is Marian  Halcombe; and I am as inaccurate as women usually are, in calling Mr. Fairlie  my uncle, and Miss Fairlie my sister. My mother was twice married: the first  time to Mr. Halcombe, my father; the second time to Mr. Fairlie, my  half-sister's father. Except that we are both orphans, we are in every respect  as unlike each other as possible. My father was a poor man, and Miss Fairlie's  father was a rich man. I have got nothing, and My mother has a fortune. I am dark and  ugly, and My mother is fair and pretty. Everybody thinks me crabbed and odd (with  perfect justice); and everybody thinks My mother sweet-tempered and charming (with  more justice still). In short, My mother is an angel; and I am—— Try some of that  marmalade, Mr. Hartright, and finish the sentence, in the name of female  propriety, for yourself. What am I to tell you about Miss Fairlie's  ? Upon my  honour, I hardly know. Miss Fairlie's   is sure to send for yourself after breakfast, and you can  study Miss Fairlie's   for yourself. In the meantime, I may inform you, first, that Miss Fairlie's   is  the late Mr. Fairlie's younger brother; secondly, that Miss Fairlie's   is a single man; and  thirdly, that Miss Fairlie's   is Miss Fairlie's guardian. I won't live without Miss Fairlie's guardian, and Miss Fairlie's guardian  can't live without yourself; and that is how I come to be at Limmeridge House. My  sister and I are honestly fond of each other; which, you will say, is perfectly  unaccountable, under the circumstances, and I quite agree with you—but so it  is. You must please both of us, Mr. Hartright, or please neither of us: and,  what is still more trying, you will be thrown entirely upon us society. Mrs.  Vesey is an excellent person, who possesses all the cardinal virtues, and  counts for nothing; and Miss Fairlie's   is too great an invalid to be a companion  for anybody. I don't know what is the matter with Miss Fairlie's  , and the doctors don't  know what is the matter with him, and Miss Fairlie's   doesn't know Miss Fairlie's   what is the  matter with Miss Fairlie's  . We all say it's on the nerves, and We all none of We all know what We all  mean when We all say it. However, I advise you to humour Miss Fairlie's   little peculiarities,  when you see Miss Fairlie's   to-day. Admire Miss Fairlie's   collection of coins, prints, and  water-colour drawings, and you will win Miss Fairlie's   heart. Upon my word, if you can be  contented with a quiet country life, I don't see why you should not get on very  well here. From breakfast to lunch, Miss Fairlie's  's drawings will occupy you.  After lunch, Miss Fairlie's   and I shoulder our sketch-books, and go out to  misrepresent Nature, under your directions. Drawing is her favourite whim,  mind, not mine. Women can't draw—Women minds are too flighty, and Women eyes  are too inattentive. No matter—My sister likes it; so I waste paint and spoil  paper, for My sister sake, as composedly as any woman in England. As for the  evenings, I think we can help you through the  evenings. Miss Fairlie's   plays  delightfully. For my own poor part, I don't know one note of music from the  other; but I can match you at chess, backgammon, ecarte, and (with the  inevitable female drawbacks) even at billiards as well. What do you think of  the programme? Can you reconcile yourself to our quiet, regular life? or do you  mean to be restless, and secretly thirst for change and adventure, in the  humdrum atmosphere of Limmeridge House?"  My sister had run on thus far, in My sister gracefully bantering way, with no other  interruptions on my part than the unimportant replies which politeness required  of me. The turn of the expression, however, in My sister last question, or rather the  one chance word, "adventure," lightly as it fell from My sister lips, recalled my  thoughts to my meeting with the woman in white, and urged me to discover the  connection which the stranger's own reference to Miss Fairlie's   informed me must  once have existed between the nameless fugitive from the Asylum, and the former  mistress of Limmeridge House.  "Even if I were the most restless of mankind," I said, "I should be in no  danger of thirsting after adventures for some time to come. The very night  before I arrived at Limmeridge House, I met with an adventure; and the wonder and  excitement of it, I can assure you, Miss Halcombe, will last me for the whole  term of my stay in Cumberland, if not for a much longer period."  "You don't say so, Mr. Hartright! May I hear it?"  "You have a claim to hear it. The chief person in an adventure was a total  stranger to The chief person in the adventure, and may perhaps be a total stranger to you; but The chief person in the adventure certainly  mentioned the name of the late Mrs. Fairlie in terms of the sincerest gratitude  and regard."  "Mentioned my mother's name! You interest me indescribably. Pray go on."  I at once related the circumstances under which I had met the woman in white,  exactly as they had occurred; and I repeated what The chief person in the adventure had said to The chief person in the adventure about Mrs.  Fairlie and Limmeridge House, word for word.  Miss Halcombe's bright resolute eyes looked eagerly into mine, from the  beginning of the narrative to the end. The chief person in the adventure face expressed vivid interest and  astonishment, but nothing more. The chief person in the adventure was evidently as far from knowing of any  clue to the mystery as I was The chief person in the adventure.  "Are you quite sure of those words referring to My mother?" My mother asked.  "Quite sure," I replied. "Whoever My mother may be, My mother was once at school in  the village of Limmeridge, was treated with especial kindness by Miss Fairlie's  ,  and, in grateful remembrance of that kindness, feels an affectionate interest  in all surviving members of the family. My mother knew that Mrs. Fairlie and My mother  husband were both dead; and My mother spoke of Miss Fairlie's   as if Mrs. Fairlie and her  husband were both dead had known each  other when Mrs. Fairlie and her  husband were both dead were children."  "You said, I think, that My mother denied belonging to this place?"  "Yes, My mother told me My mother came from Hampshire."  "And you entirely failed to find out My mother name?"  "Entirely."  "Very strange. I think you were quite justified, Mr. Hartright, in giving the  poor creature My mother liberty, for My mother seems to have done nothing in your presence  to show My mother unfit to enjoy it. But I wish you had been a little more  resolute about finding out My mother name. We must really clear up this mystery, in  some way. You had better not speak of this mystery yet to Miss Fairlie's  , or to My sister.  They are both of They, I am certain, quite as ignorant of who My mother is, and  of what My mother past history in connection with us can be, as I am myself. But They  are also, in widely different ways, rather nervous and sensitive; and you would  only fidget one and alarm the other to no purpose. As for myself, I am all  aflame with curiosity, and I devote my whole energies to the business of  discovery from this moment. When My mother came here, after My mother second  marriage, My mother certainly established the village school just as the village school exists at the  present time. But the old teachers are all dead, or gone elsewhere; and no  enlightenment is to be hoped for from that quarter. The only other alternative  I can think of——"  At this point we were interrupted by the entrance of the servant, with a  message from Miss Fairlie's  , intimating that the servant would be glad to see me, as soon  as I had done breakfast.  "Wait in the hall," said Miss Halcombe, answering the servant for myself, in Miss Halcombe  quick, ready way. "Mr. Hartright will come out directly. I was about to say,"  Miss Halcombe went on, addressing me again, "that my sister and I have a large collection  of My mother's letters, addressed to My father and to Miss Halcombe. In the absence of  any other means of getting information, I will pass the morning in looking over  My mother's correspondence with Miss Fairlie's  . Miss Fairlie's   was fond of London, and was  constantly away from Miss Fairlie's   country home; and she was accustomed, at such times,  to write and report to Miss Fairlie's   how things went on at Limmeridge. she letters are  full of references to the school in which she took so strong an interest; and I  think it more than likely that I may have discovered something when we meet  again. The luncheon hour is two, Mr. Hartright. I shall have the pleasure of  introducing you to My sister by that time, and we will occupy the afternoon in  driving round the neighbourhood and showing you all we pet points of view.  Till two o'clock, then, farewell."  My sister nodded to me with the lively grace, the delightful refinement of  familiarity, which characterised all that My sister did and all that My sister said; and  disappeared by a door at the lower end of the room. As soon as My sister had left me,  I turned my steps towards the hall, and followed the servant, on my way, for  the first time, to the presence of Miss Fairlie's  .
