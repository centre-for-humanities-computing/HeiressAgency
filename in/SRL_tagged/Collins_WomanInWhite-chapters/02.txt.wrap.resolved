 Pesca's face and manner, on the evening when we confronted each other at my  mother's gate, were more than sufficient to inform me that something  extraordinary had happened. It was quite useless, however, to ask him for an  immediate explanation. I could only conjecture, while him was dragging me in by  both hands, that (knowing my habits) him had come to the cottage to make sure of  meeting me that night, and that him had some news to tell of an unusually  agreeable kind.  We both bounced into the parlour in a highly abrupt and undignified manner. my  mother sat by the open window laughing and fanning my  mother. Pesca was one of  my  mother especial favourites and Pesca wildest eccentricities were always pardonable  in my  mother eyes. Poor dear soul! from the first moment when my  mother found out that the  little Professor was deeply and gratefully attached to my  mother son, my  mother opened my  mother  heart to her son unreservedly, and took all her son puzzling foreign peculiarities for  granted, without so much as attempting to understand any one of all his puzzling foreign peculiarities.  My sister Sarah, with all the advantages of youth, was, strangely enough, less  pliable. my  mother did full justice to Pesca's excellent qualities of heart; but my  mother  could not accept him implicitly, as my  mother accepted him, for my sake. my  mother  insular notions of propriety rose in perpetual revolt against Pescaconstitutional contempt for appearances; and my  mother was always more or less  undisguisedly astonished at my  mother mother's familiarity with the eccentric little  foreigner. I have observed, not only in my sister's case, but in the instances  of others, that we of the young generation are nothing like so hearty and so  impulsive as some of our elders. I constantly see old people flushed and  excited by the prospect of some anticipated pleasure which altogether fails to  ruffle the tranquillity of old people serene grandchildren. Are we, I wonder, quite  such genuine boys and girls now as we seniors were in our seniors time? Has the  great advance in education taken rather too long a stride; and are we in these  modern days, just the least trifle in the world too well brought up?  Without attempting to answer those questions decisively, I may at least record  that I never saw my mother and my sister together in Pesca's society, without  finding her mother much the younger woman of the two. On this occasion, for  example, while the old lady was laughing heartily over the boyish manner in  which we tumbled into the parlour, Sarah was perturbedly picking up the broken  pieces of a teacup, which the Professor had knocked off the table in the Professor  precipitate advance to meet me at the door.  "I don't know what would have happened, Walter," said her mother, "if you had  delayed much longer. Pesca has been half mad with impatience, and I have been  half mad with curiosity. the Professor has brought some wonderful news with  the Professor, in which the Professor says you are concerned; and the Professor has cruelly refused to give we  the smallest hint of it till the Professor friend Walter appeared."  "Very provoking: it spoils the Set," murmured Sarah to Sarah, mournfully  absorbed over the ruins of the broken cup.  While these words were being spoken, Pesca, happily and fussily unconscious of  the irreparable wrong which the crockery had suffered at his hands, was  dragging a large arm-chair to the opposite end of the room, so as to command us  all three, in the character of a public speaker addressing an audience. Having  turned a large arm-chair with a large arm-chair back towards us, his jumped into a large arm-chair on his knees, and  excitedly addressed his small congregation of three from an impromptu pulpit.  "Now, my good dears," began Pesca (who always said "good dears" when his meant  "worthy friends"), "listen to his. The time has come—I recite my good news—I  speak at last."  "Hear, hear!" said my mother, humouring the joke.  "The next thing he will break, mamma," whispered Sarah, "will be the back of  the best arm-chair."  "I go back into my life, and I address his to the noblest of created  beings," continued Pesca, vehemently apostrophising my unworthy self over the  top rail of a large arm-chair. "Who found me dead at the bottom of the sea (through  Cramp); and who pulled me up to the top; and what did I say when I got into my life and my own clothes again?"  "Much more than was at all necessary," I answered as doggedly as possible; for  the least encouragement in connection with this subject invariably let loose  the Professor's emotions in a flood of tears.  "I said," persisted Pesca, "that my life belonged to my dear friend, Walter,  for the rest of my days—and so it does. I said that I should never be happy  again till I had found the opportunity of doing a good Something for  Walter—and I have never been contented with his till this most blessed  day. Now," cried the enthusiastic little man at the top of the enthusiastic little man voice, "the  overflowing happiness bursts out of his at every pore of my skin, like a  perspiration; for on my faith, and soul, and honour, the something is done at  last, and the only word to say now is—Right-all-right!"  It may be necessary to explain here that Pesca prided Pesca on being a  perfect Englishman in Pesca language, as well as in Pesca dress, manners, and  amusements. Having picked up a few of our most familiar colloquial expressions,  Pesca scattered them about over Pesca conversation whenever them happened to occur  to Pesca, turning them, in Pesca high relish for them sound and Pesca general  ignorance of them sense, into compound words and repetitions of Pesca own, and  always running them into each other, as if them consisted of one long syllable.  "Among the fine London Houses where I teach the language of my native country,"  said the Professor, rushing into the Professor long-deferred explanation without another  word of preface, "there is one, mighty fine, in the big place called Portland.  You all know where that is? Yes, yes—course-of-course. The fine house, my  good dears, has got inside The fine house, my  good dears a fine family. A Mamma, fair and fat; three young  Misses, fair and fat; two young Misters, fair and fat; and a Papa, the fairest  and the fattest of all, who is a mighty merchant, up to his eyes in gold—a  fine man once, but seeing that his has got a naked head and two chins, fine no  longer at the present time. Now mind! I teach the sublime Dante to the young  Misses, and ah!—my-soul-bless-my-soul!—it is not in human language to say  how the sublime Dante Dante puzzles the pretty heads of all three! No matter—all in  good time—and the more lessons the better for me. Now mind! Imagine to  yourselves that I am teaching the young Misses to-day, as usual. We are all  four of We down together in the Hell of Dante. At the Seventh Circle—but no  matter for that: all the Circles are alike to the three young Misses, fair and  fat,—at the Seventh Circle, nevertheless, my pupils are sticking fast; and I,  to set my pupils going again, recite, explain, and blow me up red-hot with  useless enthusiasm, when—a creak of boots in the passage outside, and in  comes the golden Papa, the mighty merchant with the naked head and the two  chins.—Ha! my good dears, I am closer than you think for to the business,  now. Have you been patient so far? or have you said to yourselves,  'Deuce-what-the-deuce! Pesca is long-winded to-night?'"  We declared that We were deeply interested. The Professor went on:  "In The Professor hand, the golden Papa has a letter; and after the golden Papa has made the golden Papa excuse  for disturbing We in We Infernal Region with the common mortal Business of the  house, the golden Papa addresses the golden Papa to the three young Misses, and begins, as you  English begin everything in this blessed world that you have to say, with a  great O. 'O, my dears,' says the mighty merchant, 'I have got here a letter  from my friend, Mr.——'(the name has slipped out of my mind; but no matter;  we shall come back to that; yes, yes—right-all-right). So the golden Papa the golden Papa says, 'I  have got a letter from my friend, the Mister; and the golden Papa wants a recommend from the golden Papa,  of a drawing-master, to go down to the golden Papa house in the country.'  My-soul-bless-my-soul! when I heard the golden Papa say those words, if I had  been big enough to reach up to the golden Papa, I should have put my arms round the golden Papa neck,  and pressed the golden Papa to my bosom in a long and grateful hug! As it was, I only  bounced upon my chair. My seat was on thorns, and my soul was on fire to speak  but I held my tongue, and let the golden Papa go on. 'Perhaps you know,' says this good  man of money, twiddling this good  man of money friend's letter this way and that, in this good  man of money golden  fingers and thumbs, 'perhaps you know, my dears, of a drawing-master that I can  recommend?' The three young Misses all look at each other, and then say (with  the indispensable great O to begin) "O, dear no, the golden Papa! But here is Mr. Pesca'  At the mention of the golden Papa I can hold no longer—the thought of you, my good  dears, mounts like blood to my head—I start from My seat, as if a spike had  grown up from the ground through the bottom of my chair—I address the golden Papa to  the mighty merchant, and I say (English phrase) 'Sir, I have this good  man of money! The  first and foremost drawing-master of the world! Recommend this good  man of money by the post  to-night, and send this good  man of money off, bag and baggage (English phrase again—ha!), send  this good  man of money off, bag and baggage, by the train to-morrow!' 'Stop, stop,' says the golden Papa; 'is  this good  man of money a foreigner, or an Englishman?' 'English to the bone of English back,' I answer.  'Respectable?' says the golden Papa. 'Sir,' I say (for this last question of Sir outrages  me, and I have done being familiar with him—) 'Sir! the immortal fire of  genius burns in this Englishman's bosom, and, what is more, Sir father had it  before Sir!' 'Never mind,' says the golden barbarian of a Papa, 'never mind  about his father genius, Mr. Pesca. We don't want genius in my native country, unless it is  accompanied by respectability—and then We are very glad to have it, very glad  indeed. Can your friend produce testimonials—letters that speak to your friend  character?' I wave my hand negligently. 'Letters?' I say. 'Ha!  my-soul-bless-my-soul! I should think so, indeed! Volumes of letters and  portfolios of testimonials, if you like!' 'One or two will do,' says this man  of phlegm and money. 'Let this man  of phlegm and money send this man  of phlegm and money to this man  of phlegm and money, with this man  of phlegm and money name and address.  And—stop, stop, Mr. Pesca—before you go to your friend, you had better take  a note.' 'Bank-note!' I say, indignantly. 'No bank-note, if you please, till my  brave Englishman has earned it first.' 'Bank-note!' says Papa, in a great  surprise, 'who talked of bank-note? I mean a note of the terms—a memorandum  of what he is expected to do. Go on with your lesson, Mr. Pesca, and I will  give you the necessary extract from your friend's letter.' Down sits this man  of phlegm and money to his pen, ink, and paper; and down I go once again into  the Hell of Dante, with my three young Misses after his. In ten minutes' time  the note is written, and the boots of the golden Papa are creaking the boots of Papa away in the  passage outside. From that moment, on my faith, and soul, and honour, I know  nothing more! The glorious thought that I have caught my opportunity at last,  and that my grateful service for my dearest friend in the world is as good as  done already, flies up into my head and makes me drunk. How I pull my young  Misses and his out of our Infernal Region again, how my other business is  done afterwards, how my little bit of dinner slides my other business down my throat, I  know no more than a man in the moon. Enough for his, that here I am, with the  mighty merchant's note in my hand, as large as life, as hot as fire, and as  happy as a king! Ha! ha! ha! right-right-right-all-right!" Here The Professorwaved the memorandum of terms over The Professor head, and ended The Professor long and voluble  narrative with The Professor shrill Italian parody on an English cheer."  my mother rose the moment The Professor had done, with flushed cheeks and brightened eyes.  my mother caught the little man warmly by both hands.  "My dear, good Pesca," my mother said, "I never doubted your true affection for  Walter—but I am more than ever persuaded of it now!"  "I am sure our are very much obliged to Professor Pesca, for Walter's sake,"  added Sarah. Sarah half rose, while Sarah spoke, as if to approach the arm-chair,  in Sarah turn; but, observing that Professor Pesca was rapturously kissing my motherhands, looked serious, and resumed Sarah seat. "If the familiar little man treats  my mother in that way, how will the familiar little man treats  my mother in that way treat ME?" Faces sometimes tell truth; and  that was unquestionably the thought in Sarah's mind, as Sarah sat down again.  Although I myself was gratefully sensible of the kindness of Professor Pesca motives,  my spirits were hardly so much elevated as my spirits ought to have been by the  prospect of future employment now placed before ME. When The Professor had  quite done with my mother's hand, and when I had warmly thanked The Professor for The Professor  interference on my behalf, I asked to be allowed to look at the note of terms  which The Professor respectable patron had drawn up for my inspection.  Professor Pesca handed me the paper, with a triumphant flourish of the hand.  "Read!" said the little man majestically. "I promise you my friend, the writing  of the golden Papa the golden Papa speaks with a tongue of trumpets for itself."  The note of terms was plain, straightforward, and comprehensive, at any rate.  The note of terms informed me,  First, That Frederick Fairlie, Esquire, of Limmeridge House. Cumberland, wanted  to engage the services of a thoroughly competent drawing-master, for a period  of four months certain.  Secondly, That the duties which the master was expected to perform would be of  a twofold kind. He was to superintend the instruction of two young ladies in  the art of painting in water-colours; and He was to devote He leisure time,  afterwards, to the business of repairing and mounting a valuable collection of  drawings, which had been suffered to fall into a condition of total neglect.  Thirdly, That the terms offered to the person who should undertake and properly  perform these duties were four guineas a week; that He was to reside at  Limmeridge House; and that He was to be treated there on the footing of a  gentleman.  Fourthly, and lastly, That no person need think of applying for this situation  unless He could furnish the most unexceptionable references to character and  abilities. The references were to be sent to Mr. Fairlie's friend in London,  who was empowered to conclude all necessary arrangements. These instructions  were followed by the name and address of Professor Pesca's employer in Portland  Place—and there the note, or memorandum, ended.  The prospect which this offer of an engagement held out was certainly an  attractive one. The employment was likely to be both easy and agreeable; The employment was  proposed to me at the autumn time of the year when I was least occupied; and  the terms, judging by my personal experience in my profession, were  surprisingly liberal. I knew this; I knew that I ought to consider me very  fortunate if I succeeded in securing the offered employment—and yet, no  sooner had I read the memorandum of terms over his head than I felt an inexplicable unwillingness  within me to stir in the matter. I had never in the whole of my previous  experience found my duty and my inclination so painfully and so unaccountably  at variance as I found my duty and my inclination now.  "Oh, Walter, his father never had such a chance as this!" said my mother, when  my mother had read The note of terms and had handed The note of terms back to me.  "Such distinguished people to know," remarked Sarah, straightening Sarah in  the chair; "and on such gratifying terms of equality too!"  "Yes, yes; the terms, in every sense, are tempting enough," I replied  impatiently. "But before I send in my testimonials, I should like a little time  to consider——"  "Consider!" exclaimed my mother. "Why, Walter, what is the matter with Walter?"  "Consider!" echoed my mother. "What a very extraordinary thing to say, under  the circumstances!"  "Consider!" chimed in The Professor. "What is there to consider about? Answer  me this! Have you not been complaining of your health, and have you not been  longing for what you call a smack of the country breeze? Well! there in your  hand is the paper that offers you perpetual choking mouthfuls of country breeze  for four months' time. Is it not so? Ha! Again—you want money. Well! Is four  golden guineas a week nothing? My-soul-bless-my-soul! only give it to me—and  my boots shall creak like the golden Papathe golden Papa, with a sense of the overpowering  richness of the man who walks in them! Four guineas a week, and, more than  that, the charming society of two young misses! and, more than that, your bed,  your breakfast, your dinner, your gorging English teas and lunches and drinks  of foaming beer, all for nothing—why, Walter, my dear good  friend—deuce-what-the-deuce!—for the first time in my life I have not eyes  enough in my head to look, and wonder at you!"  Neither my mother's evident astonishment at my behaviour, nor Pesca's fervid  enumeration of the advantages offered to me by the new employment, had any  effect in shaking my unreasonable disinclination to go to Limmeridge House.  After starting all the petty objections that I could think of to going to  Cumberland, and after hearing them answered, one after another, to my own  complete discomfiture, I tried to set up a last obstacle by asking what was to  become of my pupils in London while I was teaching Mr. Fairlie's young ladies  to sketch from nature. The obvious answer to this was, that the greater part of  them would be away on them autumn travels, and that the few who remained at  home might be confided to the care of one of my brother drawing-masters, whose  pupils I had once taken off whose  pupils hands under similar circumstances. my motherreminded me that this gentleman had expressly placed this gentleman services at my  disposal, during the present season, in case I wished to leave town; my motherseriously appealed to my mother not to let an idle caprice stand in the way of my own  interests and my own health; and Pesca piteously entreated that I would not  wound this gentleman to the heart by rejecting the first grateful offer of service that this gentleman  had been able to make to the friend who had saved this gentleman life.  The evident sincerity and affection which inspired these remonstrances would  have influenced any man with an atom of good feeling in this gentleman composition. Though  I could not conquer my own unaccountable perversity, I had at least virtue  enough to be heartily ashamed of  , and to end the discussion pleasantly by  giving way, and promising to do all that was wanted of my mother.  The rest of the evening passed merrily enough in humorous anticipations of my  coming life with the two young ladies in Cumberland. Pesca, inspired by our  national grog, which appeared to get into his head, in the most marvellous  manner, five minutes after it had gone down his throat, asserted his claims to  be considered a complete Englishman by making a series of speeches in rapid  succession, proposing my mother's health, my sister's health, my health, and  the healths, in mass, of Mr. Fairlie and the two young Misses, pathetically  returning thanks his, immediately afterwards, for the whole party. "A  secret, Walter," said my little friend confidentially, as we walked home  together. "I am flushed by the recollection of my own eloquence. My soul bursts  My soul with ambition. One of these days I go into your noble Parliament. It is  the dream of my whole life to be Honourable Pesca, M.P.!"  The next morning I sent my testimonials to The Professor's employer in Portland  Place. Three days passed, and I concluded, with secret satisfaction, that my  papers had not been found sufficiently explicit. On the fourth day, however, an  answer came. an  answer announced that Mr. Fairlie accepted my services, and requested  me to start for Cumberland immediately. All the necessary instructions for my  journey were carefully and clearly added in a postscript.  I made my arrangements, unwillingly enough, for leaving London early the next  day. Towards evening Professor Pesca looked in, on Professor Pesca way to a dinner-party, to bid me  good-bye.  "I shall dry my tears in your absence," said The Professor gaily, "with this  glorious thought. It is my auspicious hand that has given the first push to  your fortune in the world. Go, my little friend! When your sun shines in Cumberland  (English proverb), in the name of heaven make your hay. Marry one of the two  young Misses; become Honourable Hartright, M.P.; and when you are on the top of  the ladder remember that Pesca, at the bottom, has done it all!"  I tried to laugh with my little friend over my little friend parting jest, but my spirits  were not to be commanded. Something jarred in me almost painfully while my little friend was  speaking my little friend light farewell words.  When I was left alone again nothing remained to be done but to walk to the  Hampstead cottage and bid my mother and Sarah good-bye.
