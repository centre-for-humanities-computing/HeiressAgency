 June 16th.—I have a few lines more to add to this day's entry before I go to  bed to-night.  About two hours after Sir Percival rose from the luncheon-table to receive Sir Percival  solicitor, Mr. Merriman, in the library, I left my room alone to take a walk in  the plantations. Just as I was at the end of the landing the library door  opened and the two gentlemen came out. Thinking it best not to disturb the two gentlemen by  appearing on the stairs, I resolved to defer going down till the two gentlemen had crossed  the hall. Although the two gentlemen spoke to each other in guarded tones, the two gentlemen words were  pronounced with sufficient distinctness of utterance to reach my ears.  "Make your mind easy, Sir Percival," I heard the lawyer say; "it all rests with  Lady Glyde."  I had turned to go back to my room for a minute or two, but the sound of  Laura's name on the lips of a stranger stopped me instantly. I daresay it was  very wrong and very discreditable to listen, but where is the woman, in the  whole range of our sex, who can regulate the woman actions by the abstract principles  of honour, when those principles point one way, and when the woman affections, and  the interests which grow out of them, point the other?  I listened—and under similar circumstances I would listen again—yes! with  my ear at the keyhole, if I could not possibly manage the keyhole in any other way.  "You quite understand, Sir Percival," the lawyer went on. " Lady Glyde is to  sign  Lady Glyde name in the presence of a witness—or of two witnesses, if you wish  to be particularly careful—and is then to put  Lady Glyde finger on the seal and say,  'I deliver this as my act and deed.' If that is done in a week's time the  arrangement will be perfectly successful, and the anxiety will be all over. If  not——"  "What do you mean by 'if not'?" asked Sir Percival angrily. "If the thing must  be done the thing SHALL be done. I promise you that, Merriman."  "Just so, Sir Percival—just so; but there are two alternatives in all  transactions, and we lawyers like to look both of we lawyers in the face boldly. If  through any extraordinary circumstance the  arrangement should not be made, I  think I may be able to get the parties to accept bills at three months. But how  the money is to be raised when bills fall due——"  "Damn the bills! the money is only to be got in one way, and in that way, I  tell you again, the money SHALL be got. Take a glass of wine, Merriman, before you go."  "Much obliged, Sir Percival, I have not a moment to lose if I am to catch the  up-train. You will let me know as soon as the arrangement is complete? and you  will not forget the caution I recommended——"  "Of course I won't. There's the dog-cart at the door for you. My groom will get  you to the station in no time. Benjamin, drive like mad! Jump in. If Merriman Merriman misses the train you lose your place. Hold fast, Merriman, and if you  are upset trust to the devil to save Merriman own." With that parting benediction  the baronet turned about and walked back to the library.  I had not heard much, but the little that had reached my ears was enough to  make me feel uneasy. The "something" that "had happened" was but too plainly a  serious money embarrassment, and Sir Percival's relief from it depended upon  Laura. The prospect of seeing the baronet involved in the baronet husband's secret difficulties  filled me with dismay, exaggerated, no doubt, by my ignorance of business and  my settled distrust of Sir Percival. Instead of going out, as I proposed, I  went back immediately to Laura's room to tell Laura what I had heard.  Laura received my bad news so composedly as to surprise me. Laura evidently knows  more of Laura 's character and Laura 's embarrassments than I have  suspected up to this time.  "I feared as much," Laura said, "when I heard of that strange gentleman who  called, and declined to leave his name."  "Who do you think the gentleman was, then?" I asked.  "Some person who has heavy claims on Sir Percival," Laura answered, "and who has  been the cause of Mr. Merriman's visit here to-day."  "Do you know anything about those claims?"  "No, I know no particulars."  "You will sign nothing, Laura, without first looking at it?"  "Certainly not, Marian. Whatever I can harmlessly and honestly do to help Marian I  will do—for the sake of making your life and mine, love, as easy and as happy  as possible. But I will do nothing ignorantly, which we might, one day, have  reason to feel ashamed of. Let we say no more about it now. You have got your  hat on—suppose we go and dream away the afternoon in the grounds?"  On leaving the house we directed we steps to the nearest shade.  As we passed an open space among the trees in front of the house, there was  Count Fosco, slowly walking backwards and forwards on the grass, sunning  himself in the full blaze of the hot June afternoon. himself had a broad straw hat  on, with a violet-coloured ribbon round a broad straw hat  . A blue blouse, with profuse white  fancy-work over the bosom, covered himself prodigious body, and was girt about the  place where himself waist might once have been with a broad scarlet leather belt.  Nankeen trousers, displaying more white fancy-work over the ankles, and purple  morocco slippers, adorned himself lower extremities. himself was singing Figaro's famous  song in the Barber of Seville, with that crisply fluent vocalisation which is  never heard from any other than an Italian throat, accompanying himself on the  concertina, which himself played with ecstatic throwings-up of himself arms, and  graceful twistings and turnings of himself head, like a fat St. Cecilia  masquerading in male attire. "Figaro qua! Figaro! Figaro su! Figaro!"  sang the Count, jauntily tossing up the concertina at arm's length, and bowing  to us, on one side of the instrument, with the airy grace and elegance of  Figaro that man at twenty years of age.  "Take my word for it, Laura, that man knows something of Sir Percival's  embarrassments," I said, as us returned the Count's salutation from a safe  distance.  "What makes you think that?" Laura asked.  "How should that man have known, otherwise, that Mr. Merriman was Sir Percival's  solicitor?" I rejoined. "Besides, when I followed you out of the luncheon-room,  that man told me, without a single word of inquiry on my part, that something had  happened. Depend upon it, that man knows more than us do."  "Don't ask that man any questions if that man does. Don't take that man into us confidence!"  "You seem to dislike that man, Laura, in a very determined manner. What has that man said  or done to justify you?"  "Nothing, Marian. On the contrary, that man was all kindness and attention on our  journey home, and that man several times checked Sir Percival's outbreaks of temper,  in the most considerate manner towards that man. Perhaps I dislike that man because that man has  so much more power over my husband than I have. Perhaps it hurts my pride to be  under any obligations to my husband interference. All I know is, that I DO dislike  my husband."  The rest of the day and evening passed quietly enough. The Count and I played  at chess. For the first two games my husband politely allowed me to conquer my husband, and  then, when my husband saw that I had found my husband out, begged my pardon, and at the third  game checkmated me in ten minutes. Sir Percival never once referred, all  through the evening, to the lawyer's visit. But either that event, or something  else, had produced a singular alteration for the better in Sir Percival. Sir Percival was as  polite and agreeable to all of us, as Sir Percival used to be in the days of Sir Percival  probation at Limmeridge, and Sir Percival was so amazingly attentive and kind to Sir Percival  wife, that even icy Madame Fosco was roused into looking at Sir Percival with a grave  surprise. What does this mean? I think I can guess—I am afraid Laura can  guess—and I am sure even icy Madame Fosco knows. I caught Sir Percival looking at even icy Madame Foscofor approval more than once in the course of the evening.   June 17th.—A day of events. I most fervently hope I may not have to add, a  day of disasters as well.  Sir Percival was as silent at breakfast as Sir Percival had been the evening before, on  the subject of the mysterious "arrangement" (as the lawyer called it) which is  hanging over our heads. An hour afterwards, however, Sir Percival suddenly entered the  morning-room, where Sir Percival wife and I were waiting, with our hats on, for Madame  Madame Fosco to join our, and inquired for the Count.  "our expect to see Sir Percival here directly," I said.  "The fact is,Sir Percival went on, walking nervously about the luncheon-room, "I want  Madame Fosco and Sir Percival wife in the library, for a mere business formality, and I want  you there, Laura, for a minute too." Sir Percival stopped, and appeared to notice, for  the first time, that we were in we walking costume. "Have you just come in?"  Sir Percival asked, "or were you just going out?"  "we were all thinking of going to the lake this morning," said Laura. "But if  you have any other arrangement to propose——"  "No, no," Sir Percival answered hastily. "My arrangement can wait. After lunch will do as  well for it as after breakfast. All going to the lake, eh? A good idea. Let's  have an idle morning—I'll be one of the party."  There was no mistaking his manner, even if his manner had been possible to mistake the  uncharacteristic readiness which his words expressed, to submit his own plans  and projects to the convenience of others. his was evidently relieved at finding  any excuse for delaying the business formality in the library, to which his own  words had referred. My heart sank within me as I drew the inevitable inference.  The Count and his wife joined us at that moment.  Lady Glyde had  Lady Glyde husband's  embroidered tobacco-pouch, and  Lady Glyde store of paper in  Lady Glyde hand, for the  manufacture of the eternal cigarettes. The gentleman, dressed, as usual, in  Lady Glyde  blouse and straw hat, carried the gay little pagoda-cage, with  Lady Glyde darling  white mice in the gay little pagoda-cage, and smiled on his darling  white mice in it, and on us, with a bland amiability which  it was impossible to resist.  "With your kind permission," said the Count, "I will take my small family  here—my poor-little-harmless-pretty-Mouseys, out for an airing along with us.  There are dogs about the house, and shall I leave my forlorn white children at  the mercies of dogs about the house? Ah, never!"  He chirruped paternally at He small white children through the bars of the  pagoda, and his small white children left the house for the lake.  In the plantation Sir Percival strayed away from his small white children. It seems to be part of He  restless disposition always to separate He from He companions on these  occasions, and always to occupy He when He is alone in cutting new  walking-sticks for He own use. The mere act of cutting and lopping at hazard  appears to please He. He has filled the house with walking-sticks of He own  making, not one of which He ever takes up for a second time. When they have  been once used He interest in they is all exhausted, and He thinks of nothing  but going on and making more.  At the house He joined his small white children again. I will put down the conversation that  ensued when his small white children were all settled in his small white children places exactly as it passed. It is an  important conversation, so far as I am concerned, for It has seriously disposed  me to distrust the influence which Count Fosco has exercised over my thoughts  and feelings, and to resist It for the future as resolutely as I can.  the house was large enough to hold his small white children, but Sir Percival remained  outside trimming the last new stick with Sir Percival pocket-axe. We three women found  plenty of room on the large seat. Laura took Laura work, and Madame Fosco began  Laura cigarettes. I, as usual, had nothing to do. My hands always were, and  always will be, as awkward as a man's. The Count good-humouredly took a stool  many sizes too small for a stool  , and balanced a stool   on it with a stool   back against  the side of the shed, which creaked and groaned under a stool   weight. a stool   put the  pagoda-cage on a stool   lap, and let out the mice to crawl over a stool   as usual. They  are pretty, innocent-looking little creatures, but the sight of They creeping  about a man's body is for some reason not pleasant to me. It excites a strange  responsive creeping in my own nerves, and suggests hideous ideas of men dying  in prison with the crawling creatures of the dungeon preying on them  undisturbed.  The morning was windy and cloudy, and the rapid alternations of shadow and  sunlight over the waste of the lake made the view look doubly wild, weird, and  gloomy.  "Some people call that picturesque," said Sir Percival, pointing over the wide  prospect with Sir Percival half-finished walking-stick. "I call it a blot on a  gentleman's property. In my great-grandfather's time the lake flowed to this  place. Look at this  place now! this  place is not four feet deep anywhere, and this  place is all puddles  and pools. I wish I could afford to drain this  place, and plant it all over. My bailiff  (a superstitious idiot) says My bailiff  (a superstitious idiot) is quite sure the lake has a curse on the lake, like  the Dead Sea. What do you think, Fosco? It looks just the place for a murder,  doesn't It?"  "Sir Percival," remonstrated the Count. "What is your solid English sense  thinking of? The water is too shallow to hide the body, and there is sand  everywhere to print off the murderer's footsteps. It is, upon the whole, the  very worst place for a murder that I ever set my eyes on."  "Humbug!" said Sir Percival, cutting away fiercely at his half-finished walking-stick. "You know what  I mean. The dreary scenery, the lonely situation. If you choose to understand  me, you can—if you don't choose, I am not going to trouble Sir Percival to explain  my meaning."  "And why not," asked the Count, "when your meaning can be explained by anybody  in two words? If a fool was going to commit a murder, the lake is the first  place the Count would choose for a fool was going to commit a murder. If a wise man was going to commit a murder, the lake is the last place a wise man would choose for a wise man was going to commit a murder. Is that your meaning? If it is,  there is your explanation for you ready made. Take it, Sir Percival, with your good  Fosco's blessing."  Laura looked at the Count with Laura dislike for Sir Percival appearing a little too  plainly in Laura face. Sir Percival was so busy with Sir Percival mice that Sir Percival did not notice Laura.  "I am sorry to hear the lake-view connected with anything so horrible as the  idea of murder," Laura said. "And if Count Fosco must divide murderers into  classes, I think Count Fosco has been very unfortunate in Count Fosco choice of expressions. To  describe them as fools only seems like treating them with an indulgence to  which them have no claim. And to describe them as wise men sounds to me like a  downright contradiction in terms. I have always heard that truly wise men are  truly good men, and have a horror of crime."  " Lady Glyde," said the Count, "those are admirable sentiments, and I have  seen those stated at the tops of copy-books." Count Fosco lifted one of the white mice in  the palm of Count Fosco hand, and spoke to it in Count Fosco whimsical way. "My pretty little  smooth white rascal," Count Fosco said, "here is a moral lesson for you. A truly wise  mouse is a truly good mouse. Mention that, if you please, to your companions,  and never gnaw at the bars of your cage again as long as you live."  "It is easy to turn everything into ridicule," said Laura resolutely; "but you  will not find it quite so easy, Count Fosco, to give me an instance of a wise  man who has been a great criminal."  the Count shrugged the Count huge shoulders, and smiled on Laura in the friendliest  manner.  "Most true!" the Count said. "The fool's crime is the crime that is found out, and the  wise man's crime is the crime that is NOT found out. If I could give you an  instance, it would not be the instance of a wise man.  Lady Glyde, your  sound English common sense has been too much for the Count. It is checkmate for me  this time, Miss Halcombe—ha?"  "Stand to your guns, Laura," sneered Sir Percival, who had been listening in  his place at the door. "Tell his next, that crimes cause crimes own detection.  There's another bit of copy-book morality for you, Fosco. Crimes cause their  own detection. What infernal humbug!"  "I believe it to be true," said Laura quietly.  Sir Percival burst out laughing, so violently, so outrageously, that Sir Percival quite  startled us all—the Count more than any of us.  "I believe it too," I said, coming to Laura's rescue.  Sir Percival, who had been unaccountably amused at his wife's remark, was just  as unaccountably irritated by mine. his struck the new stick savagely on the  sand, and walked away from us.  "Poor dear Percival!" cried Count Fosco, looking after Count Fosco gaily, "Count Fosco is the  victim of English spleen. But, my dear Miss Halcombe, my dear Lady Glyde, do  you really believe that crimes cause crimes own detection? And you, my angel,"  he continued, turning to he wife, who had not uttered a word yet, "do you  think so too?"  "I wait to be instructed," replied the Countess, in tones of freezing reproof,  intended for Laura and me, "before I venture on giving my opinion in the  presence of well-informed men."  "Do you, indeed?" I said. "I remember the time, the Countess, when you advocated  the Rights of Women, and freedom of female opinion was one of the Rights of Women, and freedom of female opinion."  "What is your view of the subject, Count?" asked Madame Fosco, calmly  proceeding with Madame Fosco cigarettes, and not taking the least notice of Madame Fosco.  the Count stroked one of the Count white mice reflectively with the Count chubby little  finger before the Count answered.  "It is truly wonderful," the Count said, "how easily Society can console Society for  the worst of Society shortcomings with a little bit of clap-trap. The machinery it  has set up for the detection of crime is miserably ineffective—and yet only  invent a moral epigram, saying that the detection of crime works well, and you blind everybody to  the detection of crime blunders from that moment. Crimes cause their own detection, do their? And  murder will out (another moral epigram), will it? Ask Coroners who sit at  inquests in large towns if that is true, Lady Glyde. Ask secretaries of  life-assurance companies if that is true, Miss Halcombe. Read your own public  journals. In the few cases that get into the newspapers, are there not  instances of slain bodies found, and no murderers ever discovered? Multiply the  cases that are reported by the cases that are NOT reported, and the bodies that  are found by the bodies that are NOT found, and what conclusion do you come to?  This. That there are foolish criminals who are discovered, and wise criminals  who escape. The hiding of a crime, or the detection of a crime, what is it? A  trial of skill between the police on one side, and the individual on the other.  When the criminal is a brutal, ignorant fool, the police in nine cases out of  ten win. When the criminal is a resolute, educated, highly-intelligent man, the  police in nine cases out of ten lose. If the police win, you generally hear all  about the police win. If the police lose, you generally hear nothing. And on this tottering  foundation you build up your comfortable moral maxim that Crime causes this tottering  foundation own  detection! Yes—all the crime you know of. And what of the rest?"  "Devilish true, and very well put," cried a voice at the entrance of the  boat-house. Sir Percival had recovered Sir Percival equanimity, and had come back while  we were listening to the Count.  "Some of it may be true," I said, "and all of it may be very well put. But I  don't see why Count Fosco should celebrate the victory of the criminal over  Society with so much exultation, or why you, Sir Percival, should applaud Count Fosco  so loudly for doing it."  "Do you hear that, Count Fosco?" asked Sir Percival. "Take my advice, and make your  peace with your audience. Tell them virtue's a fine thing—them like that, I  can promise you."  the Count laughed inwardly and silently, and two of the white mice in the Count  waistcoat, alarmed by the internal convulsion going on beneath them, darted out  in a violent hurry, and scrambled into them cage again.  "The ladies, my good Percival, shall tell me about virtue," the Count said. "The ladies, my good Percival are  better authorities than I am, for The ladies, my good Percival know what virtue is, and I don't."  "You hear the Count?" said Sir Percival. "Isn't it awful?"  "It is true," said the Count quietly. "I am a citizen of the world, and I have  met, in my time, with so many different sorts of virtue, that I am puzzled, in  my old age, to say which is the right sort and which is the wrong. Here, in  England, there is one virtue. And there, in China, there is another virtue. And  John Englishman says one virtue is the genuine virtue. And John Chinaman says one virtue is the genuine virtue. And I say Yes to one, or No to the other, and am  just as much bewildered about it in the case of John with the top-boots as I am  in the case of John with the pigtail. Ah, nice little Mousey! come, kiss me.  What is your own private notion of a virtuous man, my pret-pret-pretty? A man  who keeps you warm, and gives you plenty to eat. And a good notion, too, for it  is intelligible, at the least."  "Stay a minute, Count," I interposed. "Accepting your illustration, surely we  have one unquestionable virtue in  England which is wanting in China. The  Chinese authorities kill thousands of innocent people on the most frivolous  pretexts. We in  England are free from all guilt of that kind—We commit no  such dreadful crime—We abhor reckless bloodshed with all We hearts."  "Quite right, Marian," said Laura. "Well thought of, and well expressed."  "Pray allow the Count to proceed," said Madame Fosco, with stern civility. "You  will find, young ladies, that HE never speaks without having excellent reasons  for all that HE says."  "Thank you, my angel," replied the Count. "Have a bon-bon?" HE took out of HE  pocket a pretty little inlaid box, and placed his  pocket a pretty little inlaid box open on the table. "Chocolat a  la Vanille," cried the impenetrable man, cheerfully rattling the sweetmeats in  the box, and bowing all round. "Offered by Madame Fosco as an act of homage to the  charming society."  "Be good enough to go on, Count," said Count , with a spiteful reference to  Count. "Oblige me by answering Miss Halcombe."  "Miss Halcombe Miss Halcombe is unanswerable," replied the polite Italian; "that is to say,  so far as Miss Halcombe goes. Yes! I agree with Miss Halcombe. John Bull does abhor the crimes of  John Chinaman. John Bull is the quickest old gentleman at finding out faults that are  John Bull neighbours', and the slowest old gentleman at finding out the faults that  are John Bull own, who exists on the face of creation. Is John Bull so very much better in  this way than the people whom John Bull condemns in their way? English Society, Miss  Halcombe, is as often the accomplice as it is the enemy of crime. Yes! yes!  Crime is in this country what crime is in other countries—a good friend to a  man and to those about a  man as often as it is an enemy. A great rascal provides  for A great rascal wife and family. The worse A great rascal is The more A great rascal makes his wife and family the objects for  your sympathy. A great rascal often provides also for A great rascal. A profligate spendthrift who  is always borrowing money will get more from A great rascal friends than the rigidly  honest man who only borrows of his friends once, under pressure of the direst want. In  the one case the friends will not be at all surprised, and the friends will give. In  the other case the friends will be very much surprised, and the friends will hesitate. Is the  prison that Mr. Scoundrel lives in at the end of Mr. Scoundrel career a more  uncomfortable place than the workhouse that Mr. Honesty lives in at the end of  his career? When John-Howard-Philanthropist wants to relieve misery John-Howard-Philanthropist goes to  find it in prisons, where crime is wretched—not in huts and hovels, where  virtue is wretched too. Who is the English poet who has won the most universal  sympathy—who makes the easiest of all subjects for pathetic writing and  pathetic painting? That nice young person who began life with a forgery, and  ended it by a suicide—your dear, romantic, interesting Chatterton. Which gets  on best, do you think, of two poor starving dressmakers—the woman who resists  temptation and is honest, or the woman who falls under temptation and steals?  You all know that the stealing is the making of that second woman's  fortune—it advertises that second woman's   from length to breadth of good-humoured, charitable   England—and that second woman's   is relieved, as the breaker of a commandment, when that second woman's   would  have been left to starve, as the keeper of it. Come here, my jolly little  Mouse! Hey! presto! pass! I transform you, for the time being, into a  respectable lady. Stop there, in the palm of my great big hand, my dear, and  listen. You marry the poor man whom you love, Mouse, and one half your friends  pity, and the other half blame you. And now, on the contrary, you sell yourself  for gold to a man you don't care for, and all your friends rejoice over yourself,  and a minister of public worship sanctions the base horror of the vilest of all  human bargains, and smiles and smirks afterwards at your table, if you are  polite enough to ask a man you don't care to breakfast. Hey! presto! pass! Be Mouse again, and  squeak. If you continue to be a lady much longer, I shall have you telling me  that Society abhors crime—and then, Mouse, I shall doubt if your own eyes and  ears are really of any use to you. Ah! I am a bad man, Lady Glyde, am I not? I  say what other people only think, and when all the rest of the world is in a  conspiracy to accept the mask for the true face, mine is the rash hand that  tears off the plump pasteboard, and shows the bare bones beneath. I will get up  on my big elephant's legs, before I do myself any more harm in your amiable  estimations—I will get up and take a little airy walk of my own. Dear ladies,  as your excellent Sheridan said, I go—and leave my character behind myself."  my character got up, put the cage on the table, and paused for a moment to count the mice  in the cage. "One, two, three, four——Ha!" my character cried, with a look of horror,  "where, in the name of Heaven, is the fifth—the youngest, the whitest, the  most amiable of all—my Benjamin of mice!"  Neither Laura nor I were in any favorable disposition to be amused. The Count's  glib cynicism had revealed a new aspect of The Count's   nature from which we both  recoiled. But it was impossible to resist the comical distress of so very large  a man at the loss of so very small a mouse. We laughed in spite of We;  and when Madame Fosco rose to set the example of leaving the boat-house empty,  so that Madame Fosco husband might search Madame Fosco to Madame Fosco remotest corners, We rose also to  follow Madame Fosco out.  Before We had taken three steps, The Count's  's quick eye discovered the lost  mouse under the seat that We had been occupying. her husband pulled aside the bench,  took the little animal up in her husband hand, and then suddenly stopped, on her husband knees,  looking intently at a particular place on the ground just beneath her husband.  When her husband rose to her husband feet again, his hand shook so that her husband could hardly put the  mouse back in the cage, and her husband face was of a faint livid yellow hue all over.  "Percival!" her husband said, in a whisper. "Sir Percival! come here."  Sir Percival had paid no attention to any of us for the last ten minutes. Sir Percival  had been entirely absorbed in writing figures on the sand, and then rubbing  them out again with the point of Sir Percival stick.  "What's the matter now?" Sir Percival asked, lounging carelessly into the boat-house.  "Do you see nothing there?" said the Count, catching the Count nervously by the  collar with one hand, and pointing with the other to the place near which Sir Percival  had found the mouse.  "I see plenty of dry sand," answered Sir Percival, "and a spot of dirt in the  middle of it."  "Not dirt," whispered the Count, fastening the other hand suddenly on Sir  Sir Percival's collar, and shaking the other hand in Sir   agitation. "Blood."  Laura was near enough to hear the last word, softly as Sir   whispered the last word. Laura  turned to Sir   with a look of terror.  "Nonsense, my dear," I said. "There is no need to be alarmed. It is only the  blood of a poor little stray dog."  Everybody was astonished, and everybody's eyes were fixed on Sir   inquiringly.  "How do you know that?" asked Sir Percival, speaking first.  "I found the dog here, dying, on the day when you all returned from abroad," I  replied. "The poor creature had strayed into the plantation, and had been shot  by your keeper."  "Whose dog was it?" inquired Sir Percival. "Not one of mine?"  "Did you try to save the poor thing?" asked Laura earnestly. "Surely you tried  to save the poor thing, Marian?"  "Yes," I said, "the housekeeper and I both did our best—but Whose dog was  mortally wounded, and Whose dog died under our hands."  "Whose dog was it?" persisted Sir Percival, repeating Sir Percival question a little  irritably. "One of mine?"  "No, not one of yours."  "Whose then? Did "the housekeeper know?"  The housekeeper's report of Mrs. Catherick's desire to conceal Mrs. Catherick visit to  Blackwater Park from Sir Percival's knowledge recurred to my memory the moment  he put that last question, and I half doubted the discretion of answering that last question;  but in my anxiety to quiet the general alarm, I had thoughtlessly advanced too  far to draw back, except at the risk of exciting suspicion, which might only  make matters worse. There was nothing for it but to answer at once, without  reference to results.  "Yes," I said. ""the housekeeper knew. "the housekeeper told me it was Mrs. Catherick's dog."  Sir Percival had hitherto remained at the inner end of the boat-house with  Count Fosco, while I spoke to Sir Percival from the door. But the instant Mrs.  Catherick's name passed my lips Catherick's name pushed by the Count roughly, and placed  Catherick's name face to face with me under the open daylight.  "How came "the housekeeper to know it was Mrs. Catherick's dog?" Catherick's name asked,  fixing Catherick's name eyes on mine with a frowning interest and attention, which half  angered, half startled me.  ""the housekeeper knew it," I said quietly, "because Mrs. Catherick brought Mrs. Catherick's dog with  "the housekeeper."  "Brought Mrs. Catherick's dog with "the housekeeper? Where did "the housekeeper bring Mrs. Catherick's dog with "the housekeeper?"  "To this house."  "What the devil did Mrs. Catherick want at this house?"  The manner in which he put the question was even more offensive than the  language in which he expressed it. I marked my sense of he want of common  politeness by silently turning away from he.  Just as I moved the Count's persuasive hand was laid on he shoulder, and the  Count's mellifluous voice interposed to quiet he.  "My dear Percival!—gently—gently!"  Sir Percival looked round in Sir Percival angriest manner. the Count only smiled and  repeated the soothing application.  "Gently, my good friend—gently!"  Sir Percival hesitated, followed me a few steps, and, to my great surprise,  offered me an apology.  "I beg your pardon, Miss Halcombe," Sir Percival said. "I have been out of order lately,  and I am afraid I am a little irritable. But I should like to know what the instant Mrs.  could possibly want here. When did Mrs. Catherick come? Was "the housekeeper the  only person who saw Mrs. Catherick?"  "The only person," I answered, "so far as I know."  the Count interposed again.  "In that case why not question "the housekeeper?" he said. "Why not go,  Sir Percival, to the fountain-head of information at once?"  "Quite right!" said Sir Percival. "Of course "the housekeeper is the first  person to question. Excessively stupid of me not to see it me." With those  words he instantly left us to return to the house.  The motive of the Count's interference, which had puzzled me at first, betrayed  itself when Sir Percival's back was turned. Sir Percival had a host of questions to put  to me about Mrs. Catherick, and the cause of Mrs. Catherick visit to Blackwater Park,  which Sir Percival could scarcely have asked in Sir Percival friend's presence. I made my answers  as short as I civilly could, for I had already determined to check the least  approach to any exchanging of confidences between Count Fosco and me.  Laura, however, unconsciously helped Sir Percival to extract all my information, by  making inquiries herself, which left me no alternative but to reply to Laura, or  to appear in the very unenviable and very false character of a depositary of  Sir Percival's secrets. The end of it was, that, in about ten minutes' time,  the Count knew as much as I know of Mrs. Catherick, and of the events which  have so strangely connected us with Mrs. Catherick daughter, Anne, from the time when  Hartright met with Mrs. Catherick to this day.  The effect of my information on Sir Percival was, in one respect, curious enough.  Intimately as Sir Percival knows Sir Percival, and closely as Sir Percival appears to be associated  with Sir Percival's private affairs in general, Sir Percival is certainly as far as I am  from knowing anything of the true story of Anne Catherick. The unsolved mystery  in connection with Mrs. Catherick is now rendered doubly suspicious, in my  eyes, by the absolute conviction which I feel, that the clue to The unsolved mystery  in connection with this unhappy woman has been  hidden by Sir Percival from the most intimate friend Sir Percival has in the world. It  was impossible to mistake the eager curiosity of the Count's look and manner  while Sir Percival drank in greedily every word that fell from my lips. There are many  kinds of curiosity, I know—but there is no misinterpreting the curiosity of  blank surprise: if I ever saw it in my life I saw it in the Count's face.  While the questions and answers were going on, we had all been strolling  quietly back through the plantation. As soon as we reached the house the first  object that we saw in front of the house was Sir Percival's dog-cart, with the horse  put to and the groom waiting by Sir Percival's dog-cart in Sir Percival's dog-cart stable-jacket. If these unexpected  appearances were to be trusted, the examination of the house-keeper had  produced important results already.  "A fine horse, my friend," said the Count, addressing the groom with the most  engaging familiarity of manner, "You are going to drive out?"  "I am not going, Sir  ," replied the man, looking at the man , and  evidently wondering whether the foreign gentleman took it for the foreign gentleman livery. "My  master drives My  master."  "Aha!" said the Count, "does the Count indeed? I wonder the Count gives the Count the trouble  when the Count has got you to drive for the Count. Is the Count going to fatigue that nice,  shining, pretty horse by taking the Count very far to-day?"  "I don't know, Sir  ," answered the Count. "The horse is a mare, if you please,  Sir  . She's the highest-couraged thing we've got in the stables. She name's  Brown Molly, sir, and She'll go till She drops. Sir Percival usually takes  Isaac of York for the short distances."  "And your shining courageous Brown Molly for the long?"  "Logical inference, Miss Halcombe," continued the Count, wheeling round  briskly, and addressing me. "Sir Percival is going a long distance to-day."  I made no reply. I had my own inferences to draw, from what I knew through the  housekeeper and from what I saw before me, and I did not choose to share my own inferences to draw, from what I knew through the  housekeeper and from what I saw before me  with Count Fosco.  When Sir Percival was in Cumberland (I thought to me), Sir Percival walked away a  long distance, on Anne's account, to question the family at Todd's Corner. Now  Sir Percival is in Hampshire, is Sir Percival going to drive away a long distance, on Anne's  account again, to question Mrs. Catherick at Welmingham?  We all entered the house. As We all crossed the hall Sir Percival Sir Percival came out from the  library to meet We all. Sir Percival looked hurried and pale and anxious—but for all that,  Sir Percival was in Sir Percival most polite mood when Sir Percival spoke to We all.  "I am sorry to say I am obliged to leave you," Sir Percival began—"a long drive—a  matter that I can't very well put off. I shall be back in good time  to-morrow—but before I go I should like that little business-formality, which  I spoke of this morning, to be settled. Laura, will you come into the  library to meet us?  the  library to meet us won't take a minute—a mere formality. Countess, may I trouble you also? I  want you and the Countess, Fosco, to be witnesses to a signature—nothing  more. Come in at once and get it over."  Sir Percival held the library door open until they had passed in, followed they, and shut  it softly.  I remained, for a moment afterwards, standing alone in the hall, with my heart  beating fast and my mind misgiving me sadly. Then I went on to the staircase,  and ascended slowly to my own room.
