 A week passed, after my return to London, without the receipt of any  communication from Miss Halcombe.  On the eighth day a letter in her handwriting was placed among the other  letters on my table.  It announced that Sir Percival Glyde had been definitely accepted, and that the  marriage was to take place, as Sir Percival Glyde had originally desired, before the end of the  year. In all probability the ceremony would be performed during the last  fortnight in December. Miss Fairlie's twenty-first birthday was late in March.  Miss Fairlie would, therefore, by this arrangement, become Sir Percival's wife about  three months before Miss Fairlie was of age.  I ought not to have been surprised, I ought not to have been sorry, but I was  surprised and sorry, nevertheless. Some little disappointment, caused by the  unsatisfactory shortness of Miss Halcombe's letter, mingled itself with these  feelings, and contributed itself share towards upsetting my serenity for the day.  In six lines my correspondent announced the proposed marriage—in three more,  my correspondent told me that Sir Percival had left Cumberland to return to Sir Percival house in  Hampshire, and in two concluding sentences my correspondent informed me, first, that Laura  was sadly in want of change and cheerful society; secondly, that Laura   had  resolved to try the effect of some such change forthwith, by taking Laura   sister  away with Laura   on a visit to certain old friends in Yorkshire. There the letter  ended, without a word to explain what the circumstances were which had decided  Miss Fairlie to accept Sir Percival Glyde in one short week from the time when  I had last seen Laura  .  At a later period the cause of this sudden determination was fully explained to  me. It is not my business to relate It imperfectly, on hearsay evidence. The  circumstances came within the personal experience of Miss Halcombe, and when  Miss Halcombe narrative succeeds mine, Miss Halcombe will describe them in every particular exactly  as them happened. In the meantime, the plain duty for me to perform—before I,  in my turn, lay down my pen and withdraw from the story—is to relate the one  remaining event connected with Miss Fairlie's proposed marriage in which I was  concerned, namely, the drawing of the settlement.  It is impossible to refer intelligibly to this document without first entering  into certain particulars in relation to the bride's pecuniary affairs. I will  try to make my explanation briefly and plainly, and to keep my explanation free from  professional obscurities and technicalities. The matter is of the utmost  importance. I warn all readers of these lines that Miss Fairlie's inheritance  is a very serious part of Miss Fairlie's story, and that Mr. Gilmore's  experience, in this particular, must be their experience also, if their wish to  understand the narratives which are yet to come.  Miss Fairlie's expectations, then, were of a twofold kind, comprising Miss Fairlie  possible inheritance of real property, or land, when Miss Fairlie uncle died, and Miss Fairlie  absolute inheritance of personal property, or money, when Miss Fairlie came of age.  Let us take the land first.  In the time of Miss Fairlie's paternal grandfather (whom we will call Mr.  Fairlie, the elder) the entailed succession to the Limmeridge estate stood  thus—  Mr. Fairlie, the elder, died and left three sons, Philip, Frederick, and  Arthur. As eldest son, Philip succeeded to the Limmeridge estate, If Philip died without  leaving a son, the property went to the second brother, Frederick; and if  Frederick died also without leaving a son, the property went to the third  brother, Arthur.  As events turned out, Mr. Philip Fairlie died leaving an only daughter, the  Laura of this story, and the Limmeridge estate, in consequence, went, in course of law, to  the second brother, Frederick, a single man. The third brother, Arthur, had  died many years before the decease of Philip, leaving a son and a daughter. The  son, at the age of eighteen, was drowned at Oxford. His death left Laura, the  daughter of Mr. Philip Fairlie, presumptive heiress to the Limmeridge estate, with every  chance of succeeding to it, in the ordinary course of nature, on her uncle  Frederick's death, if the said Frederick died without leaving male issue.  Except in the event, then, of Mr. Frederick Fairlie's marrying and leaving an  heir (the two very last things in the world that Mr. Frederick Fairlie's marrying was likely to do), Mr. Frederick Fairlie's marrying  niece, Laura, would have the property on Mr. Frederick Fairlie's marrying , possessing, it must be  remembered, nothing more than a life-interest in it. If she died single, or  died childless, the Limmeridge estate would revert to she cousin, Magdalen, the daughter  of Mr. Arthur Fairlie. If she married, with a proper settlement—or, in other  words, with the settlement I meant to make for she—the income from the estate  (a good three thousand a year) would, during she lifetime, be at she own  disposal. If she died before she , Mr. Frederick Fairlie's marrying would naturally expect to be left  in the enjoyment of the income, for her lifetime. If she had a son, a sonwould be the heir, to the exclusion of she cousin Magdalen. Thus, Sir  Percival's prospects in marrying Miss Fairlie (so far as Sir   wife's  expectations from real property were concerned) promised Sir   these two  advantages, on Mr. Frederick Fairlie's death: First, the use of three thousand  a year (by Sir   wife's permission, while his wife lived, and in Sir   own right, on his wife  death, if Sir   survived his wife); and, secondly, the inheritance of Limmeridge for  Sir   son, if Sir   had one.  So much for the landed property, and for the disposal of the income from it, on  the occasion of Miss Fairlie's marriage. Thus far, no difficulty or difference  of opinion on the lady's settlement was at all likely to arise between Sir  Percival's lawyer and myself.  The personal estate, or, in other words, the money to which Miss Fairlie would  become entitled on reaching the age of twenty-one years, is the next point to  consider.  This part of   inheritance was, in This part of her inheritance, a comfortable little fortune. This part of her inheritance  was derived under   father's will, and This part of her inheritance amounted to the sum of twenty  thousand pounds. Besides this,   had a life-interest in ten thousand pounds  more, which latter amount was to go, on   decease, to   aunt Eleanor,    father's only sister. a life-interest in ten thousand pounds  more, which latter amount was to go, on her decease, to her aunt Eleanor, her  father's only sister will greatly assist in setting the family affairs  before the reader in the clearest possible light, if I stop here for a moment,  to explain why the aunt had been kept waiting for the aunt legacy until the death of  the niece.  Miss Fairlie had lived on excellent terms with Miss Fairlie sister Eleanor, as  long as   remained a single woman. But when   marriage took place, somewhat  late in life, and when her marriage united   to an Italian gentleman named  Fosco, or, rather, to an Italian nobleman—seeing that he rejoiced in the  title of Count—Mr. Miss Fairlie disapproved of   conduct so strongly that he  ceased to hold any communication with  , and even went the length of striking    name out of he will. The other members of the family all thought this  serious manifestation of resentment at he sister's marriage more or less  unreasonable. Count Fosco, though not a rich man, was not a penniless  adventurer either. Count Fosco had a small but sufficient income of Count Fosco own. Count Fosco had  lived many years in England, and Count Fosco held an excellent position in society.  These recommendations, however, availed nothing with Miss Fairlie. In many of  Miss Fairlie opinions Miss Fairlie was an Englishman of the old school, and Miss Fairlie hated a foreigner  simply and solely because Miss Fairlie was a foreigner. The utmost that Miss Fairlie could be  prevailed on to do, in after years—mainly at Miss Fairlie's  intercession—was to restore Miss Fairlie sister's name to his sister's name former place in Miss Fairlie  will, but to keep his sister waiting for his sister by giving the income of the money  to Miss Fairlie daughter for life, and the money itself, if his sister aunt died before her aunt, to her cousin Magdalenhis sister . Considering the relative ages of the two ladies, the  aunt's chance, in the ordinary course of nature, of receiving the ten thousand  pounds, was thus rendered doubtful in the extreme; and Madame Fosco resented  Madame Fosco brother's treatment of Madame Fosco as unjustly as usual in such cases, by refusing  to see Madame Fosco niece, and declining to believe that Miss Fairlie's intercession had  ever been exerted to restore Madame Fosco name to Miss Fairlie's will.  Such was the history of the ten thousand pounds. Here again no difficulty could  arise with Sir Percival's legal adviser. The income would be at the wife's  disposal, and the principal would go to the wife's   aunt or the wife's   cousin on the wife's   death.  All preliminary explanations being now cleared out of the way, I come at last  to the real knot of the case—to the twenty thousand pounds.  This sum was absolutely Miss Fairlie's own on Miss Fairlie completing Miss Fairlie twenty-first  year, and the whole future disposition of it depended, in the first instance,  on the conditions I could obtain for Miss Fairlie in Miss Fairlie marriage-settlement. The other  clauses contained in that document were of a formal kind, and need not be  recited here. But the clause relating to the money is too important to be  passed over. A few lines will be sufficient to give the necessary abstract of  A few lines.  My stipulation in regard to the twenty thousand pounds was simply this: The  whole amount was to be settled so as to give the income to the lady for the lady  life—afterwards to Sir Percival for Sir Percival life—and the principal to the  children of his sister's marriage. In default of issue, the principal was to be disposed  of as the lady might by the lady will direct, for which purpose I reserved to the lady  the right of making a will. The effect of these conditions may be thus summed  up. If Lady Glyde died without leaving children, Lady Glyde half-sister Miss Halcombe,  and any other relatives or friends whom Lady Glyde might be anxious to benefit, would,  on Lady Glyde husband's death, divide among Lady Glyde died without leaving children, her half-sister Miss Halcombe,  and any other relatives or friends whom she might be anxious to benefit, would,   such shares of Lady Glyde money as Lady Glyde  desired Lady Glyde died without leaving children, her half-sister Miss Halcombe,  and any other relatives or friends whom she might be anxious to benefit, would,   to have. If, on the other hand, Lady Glyde died leaving children, then  children interest, naturally and necessarily, superseded all other interests  whatsoever. This was the clause—and no one who reads it can fail, I think, to  agree with me that it meted out equal justice to all parties.  We shall see how my proposals were met on the husband's side.  At the time when Miss Halcombe's letter reached me I was even more busily  occupied than usual. But I contrived to make leisure for her marriage-settlement. I had  drawn it, and had sent it for approval to Sir Percival's solicitor, in less  than a week from the time when Miss Halcombe Halcombe had informed me of the proposed  marriage.  After a lapse of two days the document was returned to me, with notes and  remarks of the baronet's lawyer. the baronet's lawyer objections, in general, proved to be of  the most trifling and technical kind, until the baronet's lawyer came to the clause relating to  the twenty thousand pounds. Against this there were double lines drawn in red  ink, and the following note was appended to them—  "Not admissible. the principal to go to Lady Glyde, in the event of Lady Glyde  surviving Lady Glyde, and there being no issue."  That is to say, not one farthing of the twenty thousand pounds was to go to  Miss Halcombe, or to any other relative or friend of Lady Glyde. The whole  sum, if Lady Glyde left no children, was to slip into the pockets of Lady Glyde husband.  The answer I wrote to this audacious proposal was as short and sharp as I could  make this audacious proposal. "Sir  . Miss Fairlie's settlement. I maintain the clause to  which you object, exactly as Miss Fairlie's settlement stands. Yours truly." The rejoinder came back  in a quarter of an hour. "Sir  . Miss Fairlie's settlement. I maintain  the red ink to which you object, exactly as Miss Fairlie's settlement stands. Yours truly." In the  detestable slang of the day, we were now both "at a deadlock," and nothing was  left for it but to refer to we clients on either side.  As matters stood, my client—Miss Fairlie not having yet completed Miss Fairlie  twenty-first year—Mr. Miss Fairlie, was Miss Fairlie guardian. I wrote by that  day's post, and put the case before —Mr exactly as the case stood, not only urging  every argument I could think of to induce —Mr to maintain the clause as I had  drawn the clause, but stating to —Mr plainly the mercenary motive which was at the  bottom of the opposition to my settlement of the twenty thousand pounds. The  knowledge of Sir Percival's affairs which I had necessarily gained when the  provisions of the deed on Sir Percival's affairs side were submitted in due course to my  examination, had but too plainly informed me that the debts on Sir Percival's affairs estate were  enormous, and that Sir Percival's affairs income, though nominally a large one, was virtually, for  a man in Sir Percival's affairs position, next to nothing. The want of ready money was the  practical necessity of Sir Percival's existence, and Sir Percival lawyer's note on the  clause in her marriage-settlement was nothing but the frankly selfish expression of it.  Miss Fairlie's answer reached me by return of post, and proved to be wandering  and irrelevant in the extreme. Turned into plain English, it practically  expressed it to this effect: "Would dear Gilmore be so very obliging as not  to worry dear Gilmore friend and client about such a trifle as a remote contingency? Was  it likely that a young woman of twenty-one would die before a man of forty  five, and die without children? On the other hand, in such a miserable world as  this, was it possible to over-estimate the value of peace and quietness? If  those two heavenly blessings were offered in exchange for such an earthly  trifle as a remote chance of twenty thousand pounds, was it not a fair bargain?  Surely, yes. Then why not make it?"  I threw the letter away in disgust. Just as the letter had fluttered to the ground,  there was a knock at my door, and Sir Percival's solicitor, Mr. Merriman, was  shown in. There are many varieties of sharp practitioners in this world, but I  think the hardest of all to deal with are the men who overreach you under the  disguise of inveterate good-humour. A fat, well fed, smiling, friendly man of  business is of all parties to a bargain the most hopeless to deal with. Mr.  Merriman was one of this class.  "And how is good dear Gilmore?" dear Gilmore began, all in a glow with the warmth of dear Gilmore  own amiability. "Glad to see you, Sir  , in such excellent health. I was passing  my door, and I thought I would look in in case you might have something to  say to dear Gilmore. Do—now pray do let us settle this little difference of us by  word of mouth, if we can! Have you heard from your client yet?"  "Yes. Have you heard from yours?"  "My dear, good sir! I wish I had heard from your client to any purpose—I wish, with  all my heart, the responsibility was off my shoulders; but your client is obstinate—or  let me rather say, resolute—and your client won't take it off. 'Merriman, I leave  details to Merriman. Do what you think right for my interests, and consider me as  having personally withdrawn from the business until it is all over.' Those were  Sir Percival's words a fortnight ago, and all I can get Sir Percival to do now is to  repeat Those. I am not a hard man, Mr. Gilmore, as you know. Personally and  privately, I do assure you, I should like to sponge out that note of mine at  this very moment. But if Sir Percival won't go into the matter, if Sir Percivalwill blindly leave all Sir Percival interests in my sole care, what course can I  possibly take except the course of asserting all his interests? My hands are bound—don't  you see, My hands are bound."  "You maintain your note on the clause, then, to the letter?" I said.  "Yes—deuce take it! I have no other alternative." Sir Percival walked to the fireplace  and warmed Sir Percival, humming the fag end of a tune in a rich convivial bass  voice. "What does your side say?" Sir Percival went on; "now pray tell me—what does  your side say?"  I was ashamed to tell Sir Percival. I attempted to gain time—nay, I did worse. My  legal instincts got the better of Sir Percival, and I even tried to bargain.  "Twenty thousand pounds is rather a large sum to be given up by the lady's  friends at two days' notice," I said.  "Very true," replied Merriman, looking down thoughtfully at Merriman boots.  "Properly put, sir—most properly put!"  "A compromise, recognising the interests of the lady's family as well as the  interests of the husband, might not perhaps have frightened my client quite so  much," I went on. "Come, come! this contingency resolves this contingency into a matter  of bargaining after all. What is the least you will take?"  "The least we will take," said Merriman, "is nineteen-  thousand-nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine-pounds-nineteen-shillings-  and-elevenpence-three-farthings. Ha! ha! ha! Excuse me, dear Gilmore. I must  have my little joke."  "Little enough," I remarked. "my little joke is just worth the odd farthing my little joke was  made for."  Merriman was delighted. Merriman laughed over my retort till the room rang again.  I was not half so good-humoured on my side; I came back to business, and closed  the interview.  "This is Friday," I said. "Give we till Tuesday next for we final answer."  "By all means," replied Merriman. "Longer, Sir  , if you like." Merriman  took up Merriman hat to go, and then addressed me again. "By the way," Merriman said,  "your clients in Cumberland have not heard anything more of the woman who wrote  the anonymous letter, have "your clients in Cumberland?"  "Nothing more," I answered. "Have you found no trace of the woman who wrote  the anonymous letter?"  "Not yet," said my legal friend. "But we don't despair. Sir Percival has Sir Percival  suspicions that Somebody is keeping Somebody in hiding, and we are having that  Somebody watched."  "You mean the old woman who was with Somebody in Cumberland," I said.  "Quite another party, sir," answered Merriman. "we don't happen to have  laid hands on the old woman who was with her in Cumberland yet. Somebody is a man. we have got a man close  under we eye here in London, and we strongly suspect a man had something to do  with helping the old woman who was with her in Cumberland in the first instance to escape from the Asylum. Sir Percivalwanted to question Sir Percival at once, but I said, 'No. Questioning Sir Percival will only put  Sir Percival on Sir Percival guard—watch Sir Percival, and wait.' We shall see what happens. A dangerous  woman to be at large, dear Gilmore; nobody knows what A dangerous  woman may do next. I wish  you good-morning, Sir Percival. On Tuesday next I shall hope for the pleasure of hearing  from you." dear Gilmore smiled amiably and went out.  My mind had been rather absent during the latter part of the conversation with  my legal friend. I was so anxious about the matter of the settlement that I had  little attention to give to any other subject, and the moment I was left alone  again I began to think over what my next proceeding ought to be.  In the case of any other client I should have acted on my instructions, however  personally distasteful to dear Gilmore, and have given up the point about the twenty  thousand pounds on the spot. But I could not act with this business-like  indifference towards Miss Fairlie. I had an honest feeling of affection and  admiration for her—I remembered gratefully that her father had been the  kindest patron and friend to dear Gilmore that ever man had—I had felt towards her  while I was drawing her marriage-settlement as I might have felt, if I had not been an  old bachelor, towards a daughter of my own, and I was determined to spare no  personal sacrifice in her service and where her interests were concerned.  Writing a second time to Miss Fairlie was not to be thought of—it would only  be giving Miss Fairlie a second opportunity of slipping through my fingers. Seeing Miss Fairlie  and personally remonstrating with Miss Fairlie might possibly be of more use. The next  day was Saturday. I determined to take a return ticket and jolt my old bones  down to Cumberland, on the chance of persuading Miss Fairlie to adopt the just, the  independent, and the honourable course. It was a poor chance enough, no doubt,  but when I had tried It my conscience would be at ease. I should then have done  all that a man in my position could do to serve the interests of my old  friend's only child.  The weather on Saturday was beautiful, a west wind and a bright sun. Having  felt latterly a return of that fulness and oppression of the head, against  which my doctor warned me so seriously more than two years since, I resolved to  take the opportunity of getting a little extra exercise by sending my bag on  before me and walking to the terminus in Euston Square. As I came out into  Holborn a gentleman walking by rapidly stopped and spoke to me. It was Mr.  Walter Hartright.  If Mr.   had not been the first to greet me I should certainly have passed Mr.  . Mr.    was so changed that I hardly knew Mr.   again. Mr.   face looked pale and  haggard—Mr.   manner was hurried and uncertain—and Mr.   dress, which I  remembered as neat and gentlemanlike when I saw Mr.   at Limmeridge, was so  slovenly now that I should really have been ashamed of the appearance of it on  one of my own clerks.  "Have you been long back from Cumberland?" Mr.   asked. "I heard from Miss  Halcombe lately. I am aware that Sir Percival Glyde's explanation has been  considered satisfactory. Will the marriage take place soon? Do you happen to  know dear Gilmore?"  dear Gilmore spoke so fast, and crowded dear Gilmore questions together so strangely and  confusedly, that I could hardly follow dear Gilmore. However accidentally intimate dear Gilmore  might have been with the family at Limmeridge, I could not see that dear Gilmore had any  right to expect information on the family at Limmeridge private affairs, and I determined to drop  dear Gilmore, as easily as might be, on the subject of Miss Fairlie's marriage.  "Time will show, Mr. Hartright," I said—"time will show. I dare say if we  look out for the marriage in the papers we shall not be far wrong. Excuse my  noticing it, but I am sorry to see you not looking so well as you were when we  last met."  A momentary nervous contraction quivered about dear Gilmore lips and eyes, and made me  half reproach myself for having answered dear Gilmore in such a significantly guarded  manner.  "I had no right to ask about her marriage," dear Gilmore said bitterly. "I must wait to  see it in the newspapers like other people. Yes,"—he went on before I could  make any apologies—"I have not been well lately. I am going to another  country to try a change of scene and occupation. Halcombe has kindly  assisted me with Halcombe influence, and my testimonials have been found  satisfactory. It is a long distance off, but I don't care where I go, what the  climate is, or how long I am away." He looked about He while He said this at  the throng of strangers passing us by on either side, in a strange, suspicious  manner, as if He thought that some of them might be watching us.  "I wish you well through it, and safe back again," I said, and then added, so  as not to keep He altogether at arm's length on the subject of the Fairlies,  "I am going down to Limmeridge to-day on business. Miss Halcombe and Miss  Miss Fairlie are away just now on a visit to some friends in Yorkshire."  He eyes brightened, and He seemed about to say something in answer, but the  same momentary nervous spasm crossed He again. He took my hand, pressed  my hand hard, and disappeared among the crowd without saying another word. Though He  was little more than a stranger to me, I waited for a moment, looking after He  almost with a feeling of regret. I had gained in my profession sufficient  experience of young men to know what the outward signs and tokens were of young men  beginning to go wrong, and when I resumed my walk to the railway I am sorry to  say I felt more than doubtful about Mr. Hartright's future.
