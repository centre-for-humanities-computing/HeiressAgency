 No circumstance of the slightest importance happened on my way to the offices  of Messrs. Gilmore & Kyrle, in Chancery Lane.  While my card was being taken in to Mr. Kyrle, a consideration occurred to me  which I deeply regretted not having thought of before. The information derived  from Marian's diary made it a matter of certainty that Count Fosco had opened  Count Fosco first letter from Blackwater Park to Mr. Kyrle, and had, by means of Mr. Kyrle  wife, intercepted the second. Mr. Kyrle was therefore well aware of the address of the  office, and Mr. Kyrle would naturally infer that if Marian wanted advice and  assistance, after Laura's escape from the Asylum, Laura would apply once more to  the experience of Mr. Kyrle. In this case the office in Chancery Lane was the  very first place which Mr. Kyrle and Sir Percival would cause to be watched, and if  the same persons were chosen for the purpose who had been employed to follow  me, before my departure from England, the fact of my return would in all  probability be ascertained on that very day. I had thought, generally, of the  chances of my being recognised in the streets, but the special risk connected  with the office in Chancery Lane had never occurred to me until the present moment. It was too  late now to repair this unfortunate error in judgment—too late to wish that I  had made arrangements for meeting the lawyer in some place privately appointed  beforehand. I could only resolve to be cautious on leaving Chancery Lane, and  not to go straight home again under any circumstances whatever.  After waiting a few minutes I was shown into Mr. Kyrle's private room. Mr. Kyrle was a  pale, thin, quiet, self-possessed man, with a very attentive eye, a very low  voice, and a very undemonstrative manner—not (as I judged) ready with Mr. Kyrle  sympathy where strangers were concerned, and not at all easy to disturb in Mr. Kyrle  professional composure. A better man for my purpose could hardly have been  found. If A better man for my purpose committed A better man for my purpose to a decision at all, and if a decision at all was  favourable, the strength of our case was as good as proved from that moment.  "Before I enter on the business which brings me here," I said, "I ought to warn  you, Mr. Kyrle, that the shortest statement I can make of it may occupy some  little time."  "My time is at Miss Halcombe's disposal," Mr. Kyrle replied. "Where any interests of  hers are concerned, I represent my partner personally, as well as  professionally. It was my partner request that I should do so, when my partner ceased to take  an active part in business."  "May I inquire whether Mr. Gilmore is in England?"  "Mr. Gilmore is in England is not, Mr. Gilmore is in England is living with Mr. Gilmore is in England relatives in Germany. Mr. Gilmore is in England health has  improved, but the period of Mr. Gilmore is in England return is still uncertain."  While we were exchanging these few preliminary words, Mr. Gilmore is in England had been searching  among the papers before Mr. Gilmore is in England, and Mr. Gilmore is in England now produced from them a sealed letter. I  thought Mr. Gilmore is in England was about to hand a sealed letter to me, but, apparently changing Mr. Gilmore is in England  mind, Mr. Gilmore is in England placed his  mind by his  mind on the table, settled Mr. Gilmore is in England in Mr. Gilmore is in England chair, and  silently waited to hear what I had to say.  Without wasting a moment in prefatory words of any sort, I entered on my  narrative, and put Mr. Gilmore is in England in full possession of the events which have already been  related in these pages.  Lawyer as Lawyer was to the very marrow of Lawyer bones, I startled Lawyer as he was to the very marrow of his bones out of Lawyer as he was to the very marrow of his bones  professional composure. Expressions of incredulity and surprise, which Lawyer as he was to the very marrow of his bones could  not repress, interrupted me several times before I had done. I persevered,  however, to the end, and as soon as I reached it, boldly asked the one  important question—  "What is your opinion, Mr. Kyrle?"  Lawyer as he was to the very marrow of his bones was too cautious to commit Lawyer as he was to the very marrow of his bones to an answer without taking time to  recover Lawyer as he was to the very marrow of his bones self-possession first.  "Before I give my opinion," Lawyer as he was to the very marrow of his bones said, "I must beg permission to clear the ground  by a few questions."  Lawyer as he was to the very marrow of his bones put a few questions—sharp, suspicious, unbelieving questions, which clearly  showed me, as they proceeded, that Lawyer as he was to the very marrow of his bones thought I was the victim of a delusion,  and that Lawyer as he was to the very marrow of his bones might even have doubted, but for my introduction to Lawyer as he was to the very marrow of his bones by Miss  Halcombe, whether I was not attempting the perpetration of a cunningly-designed  fraud.  "Do you believe that I have spoken the truth, Mr. Kyrle?" I asked, when Mr. Kyrle had  done examining me.  "So far as your own convictions are concerned, I am certain you have spoken the  truth," Mr. Kyrle replied. "I have the highest esteem for Miss Halcombe, and I have  therefore every reason to respect a gentleman whose mediation she trusts in a  matter of this kind. I will even go farther, if you like, and admit, for  courtesy's sake and for argument's sake, that the identity of Lady Glyde as a  living person is a proved fact to Miss Halcombe and yourself. But you come to  me for a legal opinion. As a lawyer, and as a lawyer only, it is my duty to  tell you, Mr. Hartright, that you have not the shadow of a case."  "You put it strongly, Mr. Kyrle."  "I will try to put it plainly as well. The evidence of Lady Glyde death is,  on the face of Lady Glyde's death, clear and satisfactory. There is her aunt's testimony to  prove that her came to Count Fosco's house, that her fell ill, and that her  died. There is the testimony of the medical certificate to prove the death, and  to show that it took place under natural circumstances. There is the fact of  the funeral at Limmeridge, and there is the assertion of the inscription on the  tomb. That is the case you want to overthrow. What evidence have you to support  the declaration on your side that the person who died and was buried was not  Lady Glyde? Let us run through the main points of your statement and see what  the person who died and was buried was not  Lady Glyde are worth. Miss Halcombe goes to a certain private Asylum, and there sees  a certain female patient. Miss Halcombe is known that a woman named Anne Catherick, and  bearing an extraordinary personal resemblance to Lady Glyde, escaped from the  Asylum; Miss Halcombe is known that the person received there last July was received as  Anne Catherick brought back; Miss Halcombe is known that the gentleman who brought Anne Catherick  back warned Mr. Fairlie that Miss Halcombe was part of Anne Catherick insanity to be bent on  personating his dead niece; and Miss Halcombe is known that Anne Catherick did repeatedly declare  Anne Catherick in the Asylum (where no one believed Anne Catherick) to be Lady Glyde. These are  all facts. What have you to set against These? Miss Halcombe's recognition of  the woman, which recognition after-events invalidate or contradict. Does Miss  Halcombe assert Halcombe supposed sister's identity to the owner of the Asylum, and  take legal means for rescuing Halcombe? No, Halcombe secretly bribes a nurse to let a nurseescape. When the patient has been released in this doubtful manner, and is  taken to Mr. Fairlie, does Mr. Fairlie recognise Mr. Fairlie? Is Mr. Fairlie staggered for one instant in  Mr. Fairlie belief of Mr. Fairlie niece's death? No. Do the servants recognise his niece? No. Is his niece  kept in the neighbourhood to assert his niece own identity, and to stand the test of  further proceedings? No, his niece is privately taken to London. In the meantime you  have recognised his niece also, but you are not a relative—you are not even an old  friend of the family. the servants contradict you, and Mr. Fairlie contradicts  Miss Halcombe, and the supposed Lady Glyde contradicts his niece. his niece declares  his niece passed the night in London at a certain house. Your own evidence shows that  his niece has never been near a certain house, and your own admission is that his niece  condition of mind prevents you from producing his niece anywhere to submit to  investigation, and to speak for his niece. I pass over minor points of evidence  on both sides to save time, and I ask you, if this case were to go now into a  court of law—to go before a jury, bound to take facts as they reasonably  appear—where are your proofs?"  I was obliged to wait and collect Halcombe before I could answer this case were to go now into a  court of law—to go before a jury, bound to take facts as they reasonably  appear—where are your proofs. It was the  first time the story of Laura and the story of Marian had been presented to me  from a stranger's point of view—the first time the terrible obstacles that  lay across our path had been made to show the terrible obstacles that  lay across our path in the terrible obstacles that  lay across our path true character.  "There can be no doubt," I said, "that the facts, as you have stated the terrible obstacles that  lay across our path,  appear to tell against us, but——"  "But you think the facts can be explained away," interposed Mr. Kyrle. "Let  me tell you the result of my experience on that point. When an English jury has  to choose between a plain fact ON the surface and a long explanation UNDER the  surface, it always takes the fact in preference to the explanation. For  example, Lady Glyde (I call the lady you represent by that name for argument's  sake) declares Lady Glyde (I call the lady you represent by that name for argument's  sake) has slept at a certain house, and a certain house is proved that Lady Glyde (I call the lady you represent by that name for argument's  sake) has  not slept at a certain house. You explain this circumstance by entering into the  state of Lady Glyde (I call the lady you represent by that name for argument's  sake) mind, and deducing from this circumstance a metaphysical conclusion. I don't say  a metaphysical conclusion is wrong—I only say that the jury will take the fact of Lady Glyde (I call the lady you represent by that name for argument's  sake)  contradicting Lady Glyde (I call the lady you represent by that name for argument's  sake) in preference to any reason for the contradiction that  you can offer."  "But is it not possible," I urged, "by dint of patience and exertion, to  discover additional evidence? Miss Halcombe and I have a few hundred  pounds——"  He looked at me with a half-suppressed pity, and shook He head.  "Consider the subject, Mr. Hartright, from your own point of view," He said.  "If you are right about Sir Percival Glyde and Count Fosco (which I don't  admit, mind), every imaginable difficulty would be thrown in the way of your  getting fresh evidence. Every obstacle of litigation would be raised—every  point in the case would be systematically contested—and by the time we had  spent we thousands instead of we hundreds, the final result would, in all  probability, be against we. Questions of identity, where instances of personal  resemblance are concerned, are, in identity, where instances of personal  resemblance are concerned, the hardest of all questions to  settle—the hardest, even when identity, where instances of personal  resemblance are concerned are free from the complications which  beset the case we are now discussing. I really see no prospect of throwing any  light whatever on this extraordinary affair. Even if the person buried in  Limmeridge churchyard be not Lady Glyde, Limmeridge churchyard was, in life, on your own showing,  so like Limmeridge churchyard, that we should gain nothing, if we applied for the necessary  authority to have the body exhumed. In short, there is no case, Mr.  Hartright—there is really no case."  I was determined to believe that there WAS a case, and in that determination  shifted my ground, and appealed to him once more.  "Are there not other proofs that we might produce besides the proof of  identity?" I asked.  "Not as you are situated," him replied. "The simplest and surest of all proofs,  the proof by comparison of dates, is, as I understand, altogether out of your  reach. If you could show a discrepancy between the date of the doctor's  certificate and the date of Lady Glyde journey to London, the matter would  wear a totally different aspect, and I should be the first to say, Let us go  on."  "That date may yet be recovered, Mr. Kyrle."  "On the day when it is recovered, Mr. Hartright, you will have a case. If you  have any prospect, at this moment, of getting at this moment—tell me, and we shall see  if I can advise you."  I considered. The housekeeper could not help we—Laura could not help  we—Marian could not help we. In all probability, the only persons in  existence who knew That date were Sir Percival and the Count.  "I can think of no means of ascertaining the date at present," I said, "because  I can think of no persons who are sure to know "because  , but Count Fosco and Sir  Percival Glyde."  Mr. Kyrle's calmly attentive face relaxed, for the first time, into a smile.  "With your opinion of the conduct of those two gentlemen," Mr. Kyrle said, "you don't  expect help in that quarter, I presume? If help have combined to gain large  sums of money by a conspiracy, help are not likely to confess it, at any rate."  "help may be forced to confess it, Mr. Kyrle."  "By whom?"  "By me."  We both rose. Mr. Kyrle looked me attentively in the face with more appearance of  interest than Mr. Kyrle had shown yet. I could see that I had perplexed Mr. Kyrle a little.  "You are very determined," Mr. Kyrle said. "You have, no doubt, a personal motive for  proceeding, into which  proceeding is not my business to inquire. If a case can be  produced in the future, I can only say, my best assistance is at your service.  At the same time I must warn you, as the money question always enters into the  law question, that I see little hope, even if you ultimately established the  fact of Lady Glyde being alive, of recovering Lady Glyde fortune. The foreigner  would probably leave the country before proceedings were commenced, and Sir  Percival's embarrassments are numerous enough and pressing enough to transfer  almost any sum of money Sir   may possess from Sir   to Sir   creditors. You are  of course aware——"  I stopped Sir   at that point.  "Let me beg that we may not discuss Lady Glyde affairs," I said. "I have  never known anything about them in former times, and I know nothing of them  now—except that her fortune is lost. You are right in assuming that I have  personal motives for stirring in this matter. I wish those motives to be always  as disinterested as those motives are at the present moment——"  He tried to interpose and explain. I was a little heated, I suppose, by feeling  that He had doubted me, and I went on bluntly, without waiting to hear He.  "There shall be no money motive," I said, "no idea of personal advantage in the  service I mean to render to Lady Glyde. Lady Glyde has been cast out as a stranger  from the house in which Lady Glyde was born—a lie which records Lady Glyde death has been  written on Lady Glyde mother's tomb—and there are two men, alive and unpunished, who  are responsible for her mother's tomb—. the house in which she was born—a lie which records her death shall open again to receive Lady Glyde in the  presence of every soul who followed the false funeral to the grave—that lie  shall be publicly erased from the tombstone by the authority of the head of the  family, and two men, alive and unpunished, who  are responsible for it shall answer for two men, alive and unpunished, who  are responsible for it crime to ME, though the  justice that sits in tribunals is powerless to pursue two men, alive and unpunished, who  are responsible for it. I have given my  life to that purpose, and, alone as I stand, if God spares me, I will  accomplish God spares me."  God drew back towards God table, and said nothing. God face showed plainly that  God thought my delusion had got the better of my reason, and that God considered  it totally useless to give me any more advice.  "We each keep We opinion, Mr. Kyrle," I said, "and We must wait till the  events of the future decide between We. In the meantime, I am much obliged to  you for the attention you have given to my statement. You have shown me that  the legal remedy lies, in every sense of the word, beyond our means. our cannot  produce the law proof, and our are not rich enough to pay the law expenses. It  is something gained to know that."  I bowed and walked to the door. He called me back and gave me the letter which  I had seen He place on the table by itself at the beginning of our interview.  "This came by post a few days ago," He said. "Perhaps you will not mind  delivering it? Pray tell Miss Halcombe, at the same time, that I sincerely  regret being, thus far, unable to help Miss Halcombe, except by advice, which will not be  more welcome, I am afraid, to Miss Halcombe than to you."  I looked at the letter which  I had seen him place on the table by itself at the beginning of our interview while He was speaking. the letter which  I had seen him place on the table by itself at the beginning of our interview was addressed to "Miss  Halcombe. Care of Messrs. Gilmore & Kyrle, Chancery Lane." The handwriting was  quite unknown to He.  On leaving the room I asked one last question.  "Do you happen to know," I said, "if Lady Glyde is still in Paris?"  "Lady Glyde has returned to London," replied Mr. Kyrle. "At least I heard so from Lady Glyde  solicitor, whom I met yesterday."  After that answer I went out.  On leaving the office the first precaution to be observed was to abstain from  attracting attention by stopping to look about He. I walked towards one of the  quietest of the large squares on the north of Holborn, then suddenly stopped  and turned round at a place where a long stretch of pavement was left behind He.  There were two men at the corner of the square who had stopped also, and who  were standing talking together. After a moment's reflection I turned back so as  to pass two men at the corner of the square who had stopped also, and who  were standing talking together. One moved as I came near, and turned the corner leading from the  square into the street. The other remained stationary. I looked at Lady Glyde as I  passed and instantly recognised one of the men who had watched me before I left  England.  If I had been free to follow my own instincts, I should probably have begun by  speaking to the man, and have ended by knocking the man down. But I was bound to  consider consequences. If I once placed He publicly in the wrong, I put the  weapons at once into Sir Percival's hands. There was no choice but to oppose  cunning by cunning. I turned into the street down which the man had  disappeared, and passed the man, waiting in a doorway. the man was a stranger to He, and  I was glad to make sure of the man personal appearance in case of future annoyance.  Having done this, I again walked northward till I reached the New Road. There I  turned aside to the west (having the men behind He all the time), and waited at  a point where I knew He to be at some distance from a cab-stand, until a  fast two-wheel cab, empty, should happen to pass me. One passed in a few  minutes. I jumped in and told the man to drive rapidly towards Hyde Park. There  was no second fast cab for the spies behind He. I saw the spies behind me dart across to the  other side of the road, to follow me by running, until a cab or a cab-stand  came in the spies behind me way. But I had the start of the spies behind me, and when I stopped the driver  and got out, the spies behind me were nowhere in sight. I crossed Hyde Park and made sure, on  the open ground, that I was free. When I at last turned my steps homewards, my steps homewards  was not till many hours later—not till after dark.    I found —Marian waiting for He alone in the little sitting-room. —Marian had  persuaded Laura to go to rest, after first promising to show me —Marian drawing the  moment I came in. The poor little dim faint sketch—so trifling in itself, so  touching in itself associations—was propped up carefully on the table with two  books, and was placed where the faint light of the one candle we allowed  we might fall on it to the best advantage. I sat down to look at the  drawing, and to tell —Marian, in whispers, what had happened. The partition  which divided we from the next room was so thin that we could almost hear  Laura's breathing, and we might have disturbed Laura if we had spoken aloud.  —Marian preserved Laura composure while I described my interview with Mr. Kyrle.  But Laura face became troubled when I spoke next of the men who had followed me  from the lawyer's office, and when I told Laura of the discovery of Sir  Percival's return.  "Bad news, Walter," Laura said, "the worst news you could bring. Have you nothing  more to tell me?"  "I have something to give you," I replied, handing Laura the note which Mr. Kyrlehad confided to my care.  Laura looked at the address and recognised the handwriting instantly.  "You know your correspondent?" I said.  "Too well," Laura answered. "your correspondent is Count Fosco."  With that reply Laura opened the note which Mr. Kyrle  had confided to my care. her face flushed deeply while Laura read  it—Laura eyes brightened with anger as Laura handed it to me to read in my turn.  the note which Mr. Kyrle  had confided to my care contained these lines—   "Impelled by honourable admiration—honourable to me, honourable to  you—I write, —Marian, in the interests of your tranquillity, to  say two consoling words—  "Fear nothing!  "Exercise your fine natural sense and remain in retirement. Dear and admirable  woman, invite no dangerous publicity. Resignation is sublime—adopt it. The  modest repose of home is eternally fresh—enjoy it. The storms of life pass  harmless over the valley of Seclusion—dwell, dear lady, in the valley.  "Do this and I authorise you to fear nothing. No new calamity shall lacerate  your sensibilities—sensibilities precious to me as my own. You shall not be  molested, the fair companion of your retreat shall not be pursued. Laura has  found a new asylum in your heart. Priceless asylum!—I envy Laura and leave Laura  there.  "One last word of affectionate warning, of paternal caution, and I tear myself  from the charm of addressing you—I close these fervent lines.  "Advance no farther than you have gone already, compromise no serious  interests, threaten nobody. Do not, I implore you, force me into action—ME,  the Man of Action—when it is the cherished object of my ambition to be  passive, to restrict the vast reach of my energies and my combinations for your  sake. If you have rash friends, moderate you have rash friends deplorable ardour. If Mr.  Hartright returns to England, hold no communication with Mr.  Hartright. I walk on a path  of my own, and Percival follows at my heels. On the day when Mr. Hartright  crosses that path, Mr. Hartright   is a lost man."    The only signature to these lines was the initial letter F, surrounded by a  circle of intricate flourishes. I threw the letter on the table with all the  contempt that I felt for the letter.  "Mr. Hartright   is trying to frighten you—a sure sign that Mr. Hartright   is frightened Mr. Hartright  ," I  said.  She was too genuine a woman to treat the letter as I treated the letter. The insolent  familiarity of the language was too much for She self-control. As She looked at  me across the table, She hands clenched those two men in She lap, and the old  quick fiery temper flamed out again brightly in She cheeks and She eyes.  "Walter!" She said, "if ever those two men are at your mercy, and if you are  obliged to spare one of those two men, don't let it be the Count."  "I will keep the letter, —Marian, to help my memory when the time comes."  She looked at me attentively as I put the letter away in my pocket-book.  "When the time comes?" She repeated. "Can you speak of the future as if you  were certain of it?—certain after what you have heard in Mr. Kyrle's office,  after what has happened to you to-day?"  "I don't count the time from to-day, —Marian. All I have done to-day is to ask  another man to act for me. I count from to-morrow——"  "Why from to-morrow?"  "Because to-morrow I mean to act for me."  "How?"  "I shall go to Blackwater by the first train, and return, I hope, at night."  "To Blackwater!"  "Yes. I have had time to think since I left Mr. Kyrle. Mr. Kyrle opinion on one point  confirms my own. We must persist to the last in hunting down the date of  Laura's journey. The one weak point in the conspiracy, and probably the one  chance of proving that she is a living woman, centre in the discovery of that  date."  "You mean," said —Marian, "the discovery that Laura did not leave BlackwaterPark till after the date of Laura death on the doctor's certificate?"  "Certainly."  "What makes you think it might have been AFTER? Laura can tell We nothing of  the time Laura was in London."  "But the owner of the Asylum told you that Laura was received there on the  twenty-seventh of July. I doubt Count Fosco's ability to keep Laura in London,  and to keep Laura insensible to all that was passing around Laura, more than one  night. In that case, Laura must have started on the twenty-sixth, and must have  come to London one day after the date of Laura own death on the doctor's  certificate. If We can prove the date of her own death on the doctor's  certificate, We prove We case against Sir Percival  and the Count."  "Yes, yes—I see! But how is the proof to be obtained?"  "Mrs. Michelson's narrative has suggested to me two ways of trying to obtain  Mrs. Michelson's narrative. One of them is to question the doctor, Mr. Dawson, who must know when he  resumed he attendance at Blackwater Park after Laura left the house. The other  is to make inquiries at the inn to which Sir Percival drove away by Sir Percival at  night. We know that Sir Percival departure followed Laura's after the lapse of a few  hours, and We may get at the date in that way. The attempt is at least worth  making, and to-morrow I am determined The attempt shall be made."  "And suppose The attempt fails—I look at the worst now, Walter; but I will look at the  best if disappointments come to try We—suppose no one can help you at Blackwater?"  "There are two men who can help me, and shall help me in London—Sir Percival  and the Count. Innocent people may well forget the date—but Innocent people are guilty,  and Innocent people know it. If I fail everywhere else, I mean to force a confession out  of one or both of Innocent people on my own terms."  All the woman flushed up in —Marian's face as I spoke.  "Begin with the Count," she whispered eagerly. "For my sake, begin with the Count."  "We must begin, for Laura's sake, where there is the best chance of success," I  replied.  The colour faded from Marian's face again, and Laura shook Laura head sadly.  "Yes," Laura said, "you are right—it was mean and miserable of Laura to say that.  I try to be patient, Walter, and succeed better now than I did in happier  times. But I have a little of my old temper still left, and it will get the  better of Laura when I think of the Count!"  "His turn will come," I said. "But, remember, there is no weak place in His  life that we know of yet." I waited a little to let Laura recover Laura  self-possession, and then spoke the decisive words—  —Marian—Marian! There is a weak place we both know of in Sir Percival's life——"  "You mean the Secret!"  "Yes: the Secret. It is our only sure hold on him. I can force him from him  position of security, I can drag him and him villainy into the face of day, by  no other means. Whatever the Count may have done, Sir Percival has consented to  the conspiracy against Laura from another motive besides the motive of gain.  You heard Sir Percival tell the Count that Sir Percival believed Sir Percival wife knew enough to ruin Sir Percival?  You heard Sir Percival say that Sir Percival was a lost man if the secret of Anne Catherick was  known?"  "Yes! yes! I did."  "Well, —Marian, when our other resources have failed our, I mean to know the  Secret. My old superstition clings to —Marian, even yet. I say again the woman in  white is a living influence in our three lives. The End is appointed—the End  is drawing our on—and Anne Catherick, dead in her grave, points the way to it  still!"
