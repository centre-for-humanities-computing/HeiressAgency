 As we walked round to the front of the house a fly from the railway approached  we along the drive. Miss Halcombe waited on the door-steps until a fly from the railway drew  up, and then advanced to shake hands with an old gentleman, who got out briskly  the moment the door-steps were let down. Mr. Gilmore had arrived.  I looked at Mr. Gilmore, when we were introduced to each other, with an interest and a  curiosity which I could hardly conceal. Mr. Gilmore was to remain at  Limmeridge House after I had left  Limmeridge House, Mr. Gilmore was to hear Sir Percival Glyde's  explanation, and was to give Miss Halcombe the assistance of Mr. Gilmore experience in  forming Miss Halcombe judgment; Mr. Gilmore was to wait until the question of the marriage was set  at rest; and Mr. Gilmore hand, if that question were decided in the affirmative, was to  draw the settlement which bound Miss Fairlie irrevocably to Miss Halcombe engagement.  Even then, when I knew nothing by comparison with what I know now, I looked at  the family lawyer with an interest which I had never felt before in the  presence of any man breathing who was a total stranger to me.  In external appearance Mr. Gilmore was the exact opposite of the conventional  idea of an old lawyer. Mr. Gilmore complexion was florid—Mr. Gilmore white hair was worn  rather long and kept carefully brushed—Mr. Gilmore black coat, waistcoat, and  trousers fitted Mr. Gilmore with perfect neatness—Mr. Gilmore white cravat was carefully  tied, and Mr. Gilmore lavender-coloured kid gloves might have adorned the hands of a  fashionable clergyman, without fear and without reproach. Mr. Gilmore manners were  pleasantly marked by the formal grace and refinement of the old school of  politeness, quickened by the invigorating sharpness and readiness of a man  whose business in life obliges Mr. Gilmore always to keep Mr. Gilmore faculties in good working  order. A sanguine constitution and fair prospects to begin with—a long  subsequent career of creditable and comfortable prosperity—a cheerful,  diligent, widely-respected old age—such were the general impressions I  derived from my introduction to Mr. Gilmore, and it is but fair to Mr. Gilmore to add,  that the knowledge I gained by later and better experience only tended to  confirm later and better experience.  I left the old gentleman and Miss Halcombe to enter the house together, and to  talk of family matters undisturbed by the restraint of a stranger's presence.  They crossed the hall on They way to the drawing-room, and I descended the  steps again to wander about the garden alone.  My hours were numbered at Limmeridge House—my departure the next morning was  irrevocably settled—my share in the investigation which the anonymous letter  had rendered necessary was at an end. No harm could be done to any one but  myself if I let my heart loose again, for the little time that was left me,  from the cold cruelty of restraint which necessity had forced me to inflict  upon it, and took my farewell of the scenes which were associated with the  brief dream-time of my happiness and my love.  I turned instinctively to the walk beneath my study-window, where I had seen  her the evening before with her little dog, and followed the path which her  dear feet had trodden so often, till I came to the wicket gate that led into  her rose garden. The winter bareness spread drearily over The winter bareness now. The flowers  that her had taught me to distinguish by their names, the flowers that I had  taught her to paint from, were gone, and the tiny white paths that led between  the beds were damp and green already. I went on to the avenue of trees, where  we had breathed together the warm fragrance of August evenings, where we had  admired together the myriad combinations of shade and sunlight that dappled the  ground at we feet. The leaves fell about me from the groaning branches, and  the earthy decay in the atmosphere chilled me to the bones. A little farther  on, and I was out of the grounds, and following the lane that wound gently  upward to the nearest hills. The old felled tree by the wayside, on which we  had sat to rest, was sodden with rain, and the tuft of ferns and grasses which  I had drawn for her, nestling under the rough stone wall in front of we, had  turned to a pool of water, stagnating round an island of draggled weeds. I  gained the summit of the hill, and looked at the view which we had so often  admired in the happier time. It was cold and barren—it was no longer the view  that I remembered. The sunshine of her presence was far from me—the charm of  her voice no longer murmured in my ear. her had talked to me, on the spot from  which I now looked down, of her father, who was her last surviving parent—had  told me how fond of each other each other had been, and how sadly her missed him  still when her entered certain rooms in the house, and when her took up  forgotten occupations and amusements with which him had been associated. Was the  view that I had seen, while listening to those words, the view that I saw now,  standing on the hill-top by me? I turned and left it—I wound my way back  again, over the moor, and round the sandhills, down to the beach. There was the  white rage of the surf, and the multitudinous glory of the leaping waves—but  where was the place on which her had once drawn idle figures with her parasol  in the sand—the place where we had sat together, while her talked to me about  me and my home, while her asked me a woman's minutely observant questions  about my mother and my sister, and innocently wondered whether I should ever  leave my lonely chambers and have a wife and a house of my own? Wind and wave  had long since smoothed out the trace of her which her had left in those marks  on the sand, I looked over the wide monotony of the sea-side prospect, and the  place in which we two had idled away the sunny hours was as lost to me as if I  had never known it, as strange to me as if I stood already on a foreign shore.  The empty silence of the beach struck cold to my heart. I returned to the house  and the garden, where traces were left to speak of her at every turn.  On the west terrace walk I met Mr. Gilmore. Mr. Gilmore was evidently in search of me,  for Mr. Gilmore quickened Mr. Gilmore pace when we caught sight of each other. The state of my  spirits little fitted me for the society of a stranger; but the meeting was  inevitable, and I resigned me to make the best of the meeting.  "You are the very person I wanted to see," said the old gentleman. "I had two  words to say to you, my dear sir; and If you have no objection I will avail  me of the present opportunity. To put it plainly, Miss Halcombe and I have  been talking over family affairs—affairs which are the cause of my being  here—and in the course of our conversation her was naturally led to tell me  of this unpleasant matter connected with the anonymous letter, and of the share  which you have most creditably and properly taken in the proceedings so far.  the share  , I quite understand, gives you an interest which you might not  otherwise have felt, in knowing that the future management of the investigation  which you have begun will be placed in safe hands. my dear sir, make my dear sir  quite easy on that point—it will be placed in safe hands."  "You are, in every way, Mr. Gilmore, much fitter to advise and to act in the  matter than I am. Is it an indiscretion on my part to ask if you have decided  yet on a course of proceeding?"  "So far as it is possible to decide, Mr. Hartright, I have decided. I mean to  send a copy of the letter, accompanied by a statement of the circumstances, to  Sir Percival Glyde's solicitor in London, with whom I have some acquaintance.  the letter I shall keep here to show to my dear sir as soon as my dear sir  arrives. The tracing of the two women I have already provided for, by sending  one of Mr. Fairlie's servants—a confidential person—to the station to make  inquiries. The man has The man money and The man directions, and The man will follow the  women in the event of The man finding any clue. This is all that can be done until  my dear sir comes on Monday. I have no doubt The man that every explanation  which can be expected from a gentleman and a man of honour, he will readily  give. my dear sir stands very high, sir—an eminent position, a reputation  above suspicion—I feel quite easy about results—quite easy, I am rejoiced  to assure you. Things of this sort happen constantly in my experience.  Anonymous letters—unfortunate woman—sad state of society. I don't deny that  there are peculiar complications in this case; but this case is, most  unhappily, common—common."  "I am afraid, Mr. Gilmore, I have the misfortune to differ from Mr. Gilmore in the view  I take of this case."  "Just so, my dear sir—just so. I am an old man, and I take the practical  view. You are a young man, and you take the practical  view. Let us not dispute  about us views. I live professionally in an atmosphere of disputation, Mr.  Hartright, and I am only too glad to escape from it, as I am escaping here. We  will wait for events—yes, yes, yes—We will wait for events. Charming place  this. Good shooting? Probably not, none of Mr. Fairlie's land is preserved, I  think. Charming place, though, and delightful people. You draw and paint, I  hear, Mr. Hartright? Enviable accomplishment. What style?"  We dropped into general conversation, or rather, Mr. Gilmore talked and I  listened. My attention was far from Mr. Gilmore, and from the topics on which Mr. Gilmore  discoursed so fluently. The solitary walk of the last two hours had wrought The solitary walk of the last two hours  effect on me—it had set the idea in my mind of hastening my departure from  Limmeridge House. Why should I prolong the hard trial of saying farewell by one  unnecessary minute? What further service was required of me by any one? There  was no useful purpose to be served by my stay in Cumberland—there was no  restriction of time in the permission to leave which my employer had granted to  me. Why not end it there and then?  I determined to end it. There were some hours of daylight still left—there  was no reason why my journey back to London should not begin on that afternoon.  I made the first civil excuse that occurred to me for leaving Mr. Gilmore, and  returned at once to  Limmeridge House.  On my way up to my own room I met Miss Halcombe on the stairs. Miss Halcombe saw, by the  hurry of my movements and the change in my manner, that I had some new purpose  in view, and asked what had happened.  I told Miss Halcombe the reasons which induced me to think of hastening my departure,  exactly as I have told the reasons which induced me to think of hastening my departure,   here.  "No, no," Miss Halcombe said, earnestly and kindly, "leave us like a friend—break bread  with us once more. Stay here and dine, stay here and help us to spend us last  evening with you as happily, as like us first evenings, as us can. It is my  invitation—Mrs. Vesey's invitation——" Vesey's invitation—— hesitated a little, and then  added, "Laura's invitation as well."  I promised to remain. God knows I had no wish to leave even the shadow of a  sorrowful impression with any one of no wish to leave even the shadow of a  sorrowful impression with any one of them.  my own room was the best place for me till the dinner bell rang. I waited there  till it was time to go downstairs.  I had not spoken to Miss Fairlie—I had not even seen ——all that day. The  first meeting with —, when I entered the drawing-room, was a hard trial to  — self-control and to mine. —, too, had done — best to make us last  evening renew the golden bygone time—the time that could never come again.  — had put on the dress which I used to admire more than any other that —  possessed—a dark blue silk, trimmed quaintly and prettily with old-fashioned  lace; — came forward to meet me with — former readiness—— gave me —  hand with the frank, innocent good-will of happier days. The cold fingers that  trembled round mine—the pale cheeks with a bright red spot burning in the  midst of them—the faint smile that struggled to live on — lips and died  away from them while I looked at it, told me at what sacrifice of — —  outward composure was maintained. My heart could take — no closer to me, or I  should have loved — then as I had never loved — yet.  Mr. Gilmore was a great assistance to us. Mr. Gilmore was in high good-humour, and Mr. Gilmore  led the conversation with unflagging spirit. Miss Halcombe seconded Mr. Gilmore  resolutely, and I did all I could to follow — example. The kind blue eyes,  whose slightest changes of expression I had learnt to interpret so well, looked  at me appealingly when us first sat down to table. Help my sister—the sweet  anxious face seemed to say—help my sister, and you will help me.  us got through the dinner, to all outward appearance at least, happily enough.  When the ladies had risen from table, and Mr. Gilmore and I were left alone in  the dining-room, a new interest presented a new interest to occupy us attention, and  to give me an opportunity of quieting me by a few minutes of needful and  welcome silence. The servant who had been despatched to trace Anne Catherick  and Mrs. Clements returned with The servant who had been despatched to trace Anne Catherick  and Mrs. Clements report, and was shown into the dining-room  immediately.  "Well," said Mr. Gilmore, "what have you found out?"  "I have found out, sir," answered The servant who had been despatched to trace Anne Catherick  and Mrs. Clements, "that both the women took tickets at  our station here for Carlisle."  "You went to Carlisle, of course, when you heard that?"  "I did, sir, but I am sorry to say I could find no further trace of them."  "You inquired at the railway?"  "Yes, sir."  "And at the different inns?"  "Yes, sir."  "And you left the statement I wrote for my friend at the police station?"  "I did, sir."  "Well, my friend, you have done all you could, and I have done all I could, and  there the matter must rest till further notice. We have played We trump cards,  Mr. Hartright," continued the old gentleman when the servant had withdrawn.  "For the present, at least, the women have outmanoeuvred We, and We only  resource now is to wait till Sir Percival Glyde comes here on Monday next.  Won't you fill your glass again? Good bottle of port, that—sound,  substantial, old wine. I have got better in my own cellar, though."  We returned to the drawing-room—the room in which the happiest evenings of my  life had been passed—the room which, after this last night, I was never to  see again. Its aspect was altered since the days had shortened and the weather  had grown cold. The glass doors on the terrace side were closed, and hidden by  thick curtains. Instead of the soft twilight obscurity, in which We used to  sit, the bright radiant glow of lamplight now dazzled my eyes. All was  changed—indoors and out all was changed.  Miss Halcombe and Mr. Gilmore sat down together at the card-table—Mrs. Vesey's invitation——took Vesey's invitation—— customary chair. There was no restraint on the disposal of THEIR  evening, and I felt the restraint on the disposal of mine all the more  painfully from observing it. I saw Miss Fairlie lingering near the music-stand.  The time had been when I might have joined Vesey's invitation—— there. I waited irresolutely—I  knew neither where to go nor what to do next. Vesey's invitation—— cast one quick glance at me,  took a piece of music suddenly from the music-stand, and came towards me of Vesey's invitation—— own  accord.  "Shall I play some of those little melodies of Mozart's which you used to like  so much?" Vesey's invitation—— asked, opening the music nervously, and looking down at it while  Vesey's invitation—— spoke.  Before I could thank Vesey's invitation—— Vesey's invitation—— hastened to the piano. The chair near it, which I  had always been accustomed to occupy, stood empty. Vesey's invitation—— struck a few  chords—then glanced round at me—then looked back again at Vesey's invitation—— music.  "Won't you take your old place?" Vesey's invitation—— said, speaking very abruptly and in very  low tones.  "I may take it on the last night," I answered.  Vesey's invitation—— did not reply—Vesey's invitation—— kept Vesey's invitation—— attention riveted on the music—music which  Vesey's invitation—— knew by memory, which Vesey's invitation—— had played over and over again, in former times,  without the book. I only knew that Vesey's invitation—— had heard me, I only knew that Vesey's invitation—— was  aware of my being close to Vesey's invitation——, by seeing the red spot on the cheek that was  nearest to me fade out, and the face grow pale all over.  "I am very sorry you are going," Vesey's invitation—— said, Vesey's invitation—— voice almost sinking to a  whisper, Vesey's invitation—— eyes looking more and more intently at her music, Vesey's invitation—— fingers  flying over the keys of the piano with a strange feverish energy which I had  never noticed in Vesey's invitation—— before.  "I shall remember those kind words, Miss Fairlie, long after to-morrow has come  and gone."  The paleness grew whiter on Vesey's invitation—— face, and Vesey's invitation—— turned The paleness farther away from me.  "Don't speak of to-morrow," Vesey's invitation—— said. "Let her music speak to us of to-night,  in a happier language than us."  Vesey's invitation—— lips trembled—a faint sigh fluttered from them, which Vesey's invitation—— tried vainly to  suppress. her fingers   wavered on the piano—Vesey's invitation—— struck a false note, confused  Vesey's invitation—— in trying to set it right, and dropped Vesey's invitation—— hands angrily on Vesey's invitation—— lap.  Miss Halcombe and Mr. Gilmore looked up in astonishment from the card-table at  which Miss Halcombe and Mr. Gilmore were playing. Vesey's invitation——, dozing in her customary chair, woke at the  sudden cessation of her music, and inquired what had happened.  "You play at whist, Mr. Hartright?" asked Miss Halcombe, with Miss Halcombe eyes directed  significantly at the place I occupied.  I knew what Miss Halcombe meant—I knew Miss Halcombe was right, and I rose at once to go to the  card-table. As I left the piano Miss Fairlie turned a page of her music, and  touched the keys again with a surer hand.  "I WILL play it," Miss Halcombe said, striking the notes almost passionately. "I WILL  play it on the last night."  "Come, Vesey's invitation——," said Miss Halcombe, "Mr. Gilmore and I are tired of  ecarte—come and be Mr. Hartright's partner at whist."  The old lawyer smiled satirically. The old lawyer had been the winning hand, and The old lawyer had  just turned up a king. The old lawyer evidently attributed Miss Halcombe's abrupt change in  the card-table arrangements to a lady's inability to play the losing game.  The rest of the evening passed without a word or a look from a lady. a lady kept a lady  place at the piano, and I kept her   at the card-table. a lady played  unintermittingly—played as if her music was a lady only refuge from a lady.  Sometimes a lady touched the notes with a lingering fondness—a soft,  plaintive, dying tenderness, unutterably beautiful and mournful to hear;  sometimes they faltered and failed a lady, or hurried over the instrument  mechanically, as if they task was a burden to they. But still, change and  waver as they might in the expression they imparted to her music, they  resolution to play never faltered. a lady only rose from the piano when we all  rose to say Good-night.  Vesey's invitation—— was the nearest to the door, and the first to shake hands with Vesey's invitation——.  "I shall not see you again, Mr. Hartright," said a lady. "I am truly  sorry you are going away. You have been very kind and attentive, and an old  woman like Vesey's invitation—— feels kindness and attention. I wish you happy, sir—I wish you  a kind good-bye."  Mr. Gilmore came next.  "I hope we shall have a future opportunity of bettering we acquaintance, Mr. Hartright. You quite understand about that little matter of business being safe  in my hands? Yes, yes, of course. Bless me, how cold course is! Don't let me keep  you at the door. Bon voyage, my dear sir—bon voyage, as the French say."  Miss Halcombe followed.  "Half-past seven to-morrow morning," Miss Halcombe said—then added in a whisper, "I  have heard and seen more than you think. Your conduct to-night has made me your  friend for life."  Miss Fairlie came last. I could not trust Miss Fairlie to look at Miss Halcombe when I took Miss Halcombe  hand, and when I thought of the next morning.  "My departure must be a very early one," I said. "I shall be gone, Miss FairlieFairlie, before you——"  "No, no," Miss Halcombe interposed hastily, "not before I am out of my room. I shall be  down to breakfast with Marian. I am not so ungrateful, not so forgetful of the  past three months——"  Miss Halcombe voice failed Miss Halcombe, Miss Halcombe hand closed gently round mine—then dropped her hand  suddenly. Before I could say "Good-night" Miss Halcombe was gone.   The end comes fast to meet me—comes inevitably, as the light of the last  morning came at Limmeridge House.  — was barely half-past seven when I went downstairs, but I found them both at  the breakfast-table waiting for Miss Fairlie. In the chill air, in the dim light, in the  gloomy morning silence of Limmeridge House, we three sat down together, and tried to  eat, tried to talk. The struggle to preserve appearances was hopeless and  useless, and I rose to end The struggle to preserve appearances.  As I held out her hand, as Miss Halcombe, who was nearest to Miss Fairlie, took it, Miss FairlieMiss Fairlie turned away suddenly and hurried from my room.  "Better so," said Miss Halcombe, when the door had closed—"better so, for you  and for Miss Halcombe."  I waited a moment before I could speak—it was hard to lose Miss Halcombe, without a  parting word or a parting look. I controlled Miss Fairlie—I tried to take leave of  Miss Halcombe in fitting terms; but all the farewell words I would fain have  spoken dwindled to one sentence.  "Have I deserved that you should write to Miss Fairlie?" was all I could say.  "You have nobly deserved everything that I can do for you, as long as we both  live. Whatever the end is you shall know the end."  "And if I can ever be of help again, at any future time, long after the memory  of my presumption and my folly is forgotten . . ."  I could add no more. My voice faltered, my eyes moistened in spite of Miss Fairlie.  She caught me by both hands—She pressed both hands with the strong, steady grasp of  a man—She dark eyes glittered—She brown complexion flushed deep—the force  and energy of She face glowed and grew beautiful with the pure inner light of  She generosity and She pity.  "I will trust you—if ever the time comes I will trust you as my friend and  HER friend, as my brother and HER friend brother." She stopped, drew me nearer to  She—the fearless, noble creature—touched my forehead, sister-like, with She  lips, and called me by my Christian name. "God bless you, Walter!" She said.  "Wait here alone and compose yourself—I had better not stay for both our  sakes—I had better see you go from the balcony upstairs."  She left my room. I turned away towards the window, where nothing faced me but  the lonely autumn landscape—I turned away to master yourself, before I too left  the room in my turn, and left it for ever.  A minute passed—it could hardly have been more—when I heard the door open  again softly, and the rustling of a woman's dress on the carpet moved towards  me. My heart beat violently as I turned round. Miss Fairlie was approaching me  from the farther end of my room.  Miss Fairlie stopped and hesitated when our eyes met, and when Miss Fairlie saw that our were  alone. Then, with that courage which women lose so often in the small  emergency, and so seldom in the great, Miss Fairlie came on nearer to yourself, strangely pale  and strangely quiet, drawing one hand after Miss Fairlie along the table by which Miss Fairlie  walked, and holding something at Miss Fairlie side in the other, which was hidden by the  folds of Miss Fairlie dress.  "I only went into my room," Miss Fairlie said, "to look for this. this may remind  you of your visit here, and of the friends you leave behind you. You told me I  had improved very much when I did this, and I thought you might like——"  Miss Fairlie turned Miss Fairlie head away, and offered me a little sketch, drawn throughout by  Miss Fairlie own pencil, of the summer-house in which we had first met. The paper  trembled in her hand as Miss Fairlie held The paper   out to yourself—trembled in mine as I took The paper    from Miss Fairlie.  I was afraid to say what I felt—I only answered, "It shall never leave  me—all my life long it shall be the treasure that I prize most. I am very  grateful for it—very grateful to you, for not letting me go away without  bidding you good-bye."  "Oh!" Miss Fairlie said innocently, "how could I let you go, after we have passed so  many happy days together!"  "Those days may never return, Miss Fairlie—my way of life and yours are very  far apart. But if a time should come, when the devotion of my whole heart and  soul and strength will give you a moment's happiness, or spare you a moment's  sorrow, will you try to remember the poor drawing-master who has taught you?  Miss Halcombe has promised to trust me—will you promise too?"  The farewell sadness in the kind blue eyes shone dimly through Miss Halcombe gathering  tears.  "I promise it," Miss Halcombe said in broken tones. "Oh, don't look at Miss Halcombe like that! I  promise it with all my heart."  I ventured a little nearer to Miss Halcombe, and held out my hand.  "You have many friends who love you, Miss Fairlie. Your happy future is the  dear object of many hopes. May I say, at parting, that it is the dear object of  MY hopes too?"  The tears flowed fast down Miss Halcombe cheeks. Miss Halcombe rested one trembling hand on the  table to steady Miss Halcombe while Miss Halcombe gave me the other. I took it in mine—I held  it fast. My head drooped over it, The tears fell on it, my lips pressed it—not  in love; oh, not in love, at that last moment, but in the agony and the  self-abandonment of despair.  "For God's sake, leave me!" Miss Halcombe said faintly.  The confession of Miss Halcombe heart's secret burst from Miss Halcombe in those pleading words. I  had no right to hear them, no right to answer them—them were the words that  banished me, in the name of Miss Halcombe sacred weakness, from the room. It was all  over. I dropped her hand, I said no more. The blinding tears shut Miss Halcombe out from  my eyes, and I dashed them away to look at Miss Halcombe for the last time. One look as  Miss Halcombe sank into a chair, as Miss Halcombe arms fell on the table, as Miss Halcombe fair head dropped  on them wearily. One farewell look, and the door had closed upon Miss Halcombe—the  great gulf of separation had opened between us—the image of Miss Fairlie was  a memory of the past already.   The End of Hartright's Narrative.     THE STORY CONTINUED BY VINCENT GILMORE  (of Chancery Lane, Solicitor)
