 The address communicated by Mrs. Todd took me to a lodging-house situated in a  respectable street near the Gray's Inn Road.  When I knocked the door was opened by Mrs. Clements Mrs. Clements. Mrs. Clements did not appear  to remember me, and asked what my business was. I recalled to Mrs. Clements our meeting  in Limmeridge churchyard at the close of my interview there with the woman in  white, taking special care to remind Mrs. Clements that I was the person who assisted  Anne Catherick (as Anne had Anne declared) to escape the pursuit from the  Asylum. This was my only claim to the confidence of Mrs. Clements. Mrs. Clements  remembered the circumstance the moment I spoke of the circumstance, and asked me into the  parlour, in the greatest anxiety to know if I had brought Mrs. Clements any news of Anne.  It was impossible for me to tell Mrs. Clements the whole truth without, at the same time,  entering into particulars on the subject of the conspiracy, which it would have  been dangerous to confide to a stranger. I could only abstain most carefully  from raising any false hopes, and then explain that the object of my visit was  to discover the persons who were really responsible for Anne's disappearance. I  even added, so as to exonerate myself from any after-reproach of my own  conscience, that I entertained not the least hope of being able to trace  Anne—that I believed we should never see Anne alive again—and that my main  interest in the affair was to bring to punishment two men whom I suspected to  be concerned in luring Anne away, and at whose hands I and some dear friends of  mine had suffered a grievous wrong. With this explanation I left this explanation to Mrs.  Clements to say whether we interest in the matter (whatever difference there  might be in the motives which actuated us) was not the same, and whether Anne  felt any reluctance to forward my object by giving me such information on the  subject of my inquiries as Mrs.   happened to possess.  Anne was at first too much confused and agitated to understand  thoroughly what I said to Anne. Anne could only reply that I was welcome to  anything Anne could tell me in return for the kindness I had shown to Anne; but  as Anne was not very quick and ready, at the best of times, in talking to  strangers, Anne would beg me to put Anne in the right way, and to say where I  wished Anne to begin.  Knowing by experience that the plainest narrative attainable from persons who  are not accustomed to arrange their ideas, is the narrative which goes far  enough back at the beginning to avoid all impediments of retrospection in its  course, I asked Mrs. Clements to tell me first what had happened after Mrs. Clements had  left Limmeridge, and so, by watchful questioning, carried Mrs. Clements on from point to  point, till we reached the period of Anne's disappearance.  The substance of the information which I thus obtained was as follows:—  On leaving the farm at Todd's Corner, Mrs. Clements and Anne had travelled that  day as far as Derby, and had remained there a week on Anne's account. They had  then gone on to London, and had lived in the lodging occupied by Mrs. Clementsat that time for a month or more, when circumstances connected with the house  and the landlord had obliged They to change They quarters. Anne's terror of  being discovered in London or London neighbourhood, whenever they ventured to walk  out, had gradually communicated London to Mrs. Clements, and Mrs. Clements had determined  on removing to one of the most out-of-the-way places in England—to the town  of Grimsby in Lincolnshire, where Mrs. Clements deceased husband had passed all her deceased husband early  life. her deceased husband relatives were respectable people settled in the town—His relatives had  always treated Mrs. Clements with great kindness, and Mrs. Clements thought it impossible  to do better than go there and take the advice of her deceased husband's friends. Annewould not hear of returning to Anne mother at Welmingham, because Anne had been  removed to the Asylum from that place, and because Sir Percival would be  certain to go back there and find Anne again. There was serious weight in this  objection, and Mrs. Clements felt that it was not to be easily removed.  At Grimsby the first serious symptoms of illness had shown the first serious symptoms of illness in Anne.  the first serious symptoms of illness appeared soon after the news of Lady Glyde's marriage had been made public  in the newspapers, and had reached Lady Glyde's marriage through that medium.  The medical man who was sent for to attend the sick woman discovered at once  that Anne was suffering from a serious affection of the heart. illnesslasted long, left illness very weak, and returned at intervals, though with  mitigated severity, again and again. the first serious symptoms of illness remained at Grimsby, in consequence,  during the first half of the new year, and there the first serious symptoms of illness might probably have  stayed much longer, but for the sudden resolution which Anne took at this time  to venture back to Hampshire, for the purpose of obtaining a private interview  with Lady Glyde.  Mrs. Clements did all in Mrs. Clements power to oppose the execution of this hazardous  and unaccountable project. No explanation of Mrs. Clements motives was offered by Anne,  except that Mrs. Clements believed the day of Mrs. Clements death was not far off, and that Mrs. Clements had  something on Mrs. Clements mind which must be communicated to Lady Glyde, at any risk, in  secret. Mrs. Clements resolution to accomplish this purpose was so firmly settled that  Mrs. Clements declared Mrs. Clements intention of going to Hampshire by Mrs. Clements if Mrs. Clementsfelt any unwillingness to go with Mrs. Clements. The doctor, on being consulted, was of  opinion that serious opposition to Mrs. Clements wishes would, in all probability,  produce another and perhaps a fatal fit of illness, and Mrs. Clements, under  this advice, yielded to necessity, and once more, with sad forebodings of  trouble and danger to come, allowed Anne Catherick to have Anne Catherick own way.  On the journey from London to Hampshire Mrs. Clements discovered that one of  their fellow-passengers was well acquainted with the neighbourhood of  Blackwater, and could give Anne Catherick all the information Anne Catherick needed on the subject of  localities. In this way Anne Catherick found out that the only place they could go to,  which was not dangerously near to Sir Percival's residence, was a large village  called Sandon. The distance here from Blackwater Park was between three and  four miles—and that distance, and back again, Anne Catherick had walked on each  occasion when Anne Catherick had appeared in the neighbourhood of the lake.  For the few days during which they were at Sandon without being discovered they  had lived a little away from the village, in the cottage of a decent  widow-woman who had a bedroom to let, and whose discreet silence Mrs. Clements  had done Anne Catherick best to secure, for the first week at least. Anne Catherick had also tried  hard to induce Anne Catherick to be content with writing to Lady Glyde, in the first  instance; but the failure of the warning contained in the anonymous letter sent  to Limmeridge had made Anne Catherick resolute to speak this time, and obstinate in the  determination to go on Anne Catherick errand alone.  Mrs. Clements, nevertheless, followed Mrs. Clements privately on each occasion when Mrs. Clements  went to the lake, without, however, venturing near enough to the boat-house to  be witness of what took place there. When Anne Catherick returned for the last time from  the dangerous neighbourhood, the fatigue of walking, day after day, distances  which were far too great for Anne Catherick strength, added to the exhausting effect of  the agitation from which Anne Catherick had suffered, produced the result which Mrs. ClementsClements had dreaded all along. The old pain over the heart and the other  symptoms of the illness at Grimsby returned, and Anne Catherick was confined to Anne Catherick bed  in the cottage.  In this emergency the first necessity, as Mrs. Clements knew by experience, was  to endeavour to quiet Anne Catherick's anxiety of mind, and for this purpose the good  woman went the good  woman the next day to the lake, to try if the good  woman could find Lady  Glyde (who would be sure, as Anne Catherick said, to take Anne Catherick daily walk to the  boat-house), and prevail on Anne Catherick to come back privately to the cottage near  Sandon. On reaching the outskirts of the plantation Mrs. Clements encountered,  not Lady Glyde, but a tall, stout, elderly gentleman, with a book in his  hand—in other words, Count Fosco.  The Count, after looking at the good  woman very attentively for a moment, asked if the good  woman  expected to see any one in that place, and added, before the good  woman could reply, that  he was waiting there with a message from Lady Glyde, but that he was not quite  certain whether the person then before he answered the description of the  person with whom he was desired to communicate.  Upon Mrs. Clements at once confided the good  woman errand to her errand, and entreated that  her errand would help to allay Anne Catherick's anxiety by trusting her errand message to the good  woman. The Countmost readily and kindly complied with The Count request. his message, The Count said, was a  very important one. Lady Glyde's entreated Anne and Lady Glyde's good friend to return  immediately to London, as Lady Glyde's felt certain that Sir Percival would discover  them if them remained any longer in the neighbourhood of Blackwater. Lady Glyde's was  Lady Glyde's going to London in a short time, and if Mrs. Clements and Anne Catherick would go  there first, and would let Lady Glyde's know what Mrs. Clements and Anne address was, Mrs. Clements and Anne should hear  from Lady Glyde's and see Lady Glyde's in a fortnight or less. The Count added that The Count had  already attempted to give a friendly warning to Anne Catherick Lady Glyde's, but that Lady Glyde's had  been too much startled by seeing that The Count was a stranger to let The Count approach and  speak to Lady Glyde's.  To Mrs. Clements replied, in the greatest alarm and distress, that Lady Glyde's  asked nothing better than to take Anne Catherick safely to London, but that there was no  present hope of removing Anne Catherick from the dangerous neighbourhood, as Anne Catherick lay ill  in Anne Catherick bed at that moment. The Count inquired if Mrs. Clements had sent for  medical advice, and hearing that Mrs. Clements had hitherto hesitated to do so, from the  fear of making their position publicly known in the village, informed Mrs. Clements that  The Count was The Count a medical man, and that The Count would go back with Mrs. Clements if Mrs. Clements  pleased, and see what could be done for Anne Catherick. Mrs. ClementsThe Count, as a person trusted with a secret message from Lady  Glyde) gratefully accepted the offer, and they went back together to the  cottage.  Anne Catherick was asleep when they got there. The Count started at the sight of Anne Catherick  (evidently from astonishment at Anne Catherick resemblance to Lady Glyde). Mrs. Clements Mrs. Clementssupposed that Mrs. Clements was only shocked to see how ill Anne Catherick was. Mrs. Clements would not  allow Anne Catherick to be awakened—Mrs. Clements was contented with putting questions to Mrs.  Clements about Mrs. Clements symptoms, with looking at Mrs. Clements, and with lightly touching Mrs. Clements  pulse. Sandon was a large enough place to have a grocer's and druggist's shop  in it, and thither The Count went to write The Count prescription and to get the  medicine made up. The Count brought his prescription back The Count, and told Mrs. Clements that the  medicine was a powerful stimulant, and that the  medicine would certainly give Annestrength to get up and bear the fatigue of a journey to London of only a few  hours. The remedy was to be administered at stated times on that day and on the  day after. On the third day Anne would be well enough to travel, and The Count arranged  to meet Mrs. Clements at the Blackwater station, and to see them off by the  midday train. If them did not appear The Count would assume that Anne Catherick was worse, and  would proceed at once to the cottage.  As events turned out, no such emergency as this occurred.  the  medicine had an extraordinary effect on Anne Catherick, and the good results of the  medicine  were helped by the assurance Mrs. Clements could now give Mrs. Clements that Mrs. Clements would  soon see Lady Glyde's in London. At the appointed day and time (when she would  soon see Lady Glyde in London had not  been quite so long as a week in Hampshire altogether), she would  soon see Lady Glyde in London arrived at the Blackwater station. The Count was waiting there for she would  soon see Lady Glyde in London, and was talking to an elderly  lady, who appeared to be going to travel by the train to London also. The Count most  kindly assisted she would  soon see Lady Glyde in London, and put she would  soon see Lady Glyde in London into the carriage himself, begging Mrs.  Clements not to forget to send Mrs. Clements address to Lady Glyde's. Lady Glyde's did  not travel in the same compartment, and Lady Glyde's did not notice what became of Lady Glyde'son reaching the London terminus. Mrs. Clements secured respectable lodgings in  a quiet neighbourhood, and then wrote, as Mrs. Clements had engaged to do, to inform Lady  Glyde of her address.  A little more than a fortnight passed, and no answer came.  At the end of that time a lady (the same elderly lady whom they had seen at the Blackwater station) called in a cab, and said that she came from Lady Glyde, who was then  at an hotel in London, and who wished to see Mrs. Clements, for the purpose of  arranging a future interview with Anne Catherick. Mrs. Clements expressed Mrs. Clements willingness  (Anne Catherick being present at the time, and entreating Anne Catherick to do so) to forward the  object in view, especially as Anne Catherick was not required to be away from the house  for more than half an hour at the most. Anne Catherick and the elderly lady (clearly  Madame Fosco) then left in the cab. Lady Glyde's stopped the cab, after the cab had  driven some distance, at a shop before they got to the hotel, and begged Mrs. ClementsClements to wait for Mrs. Clements for a few minutes while Mrs. Clements made a purchase that had  been forgotten. Lady Glyde's never appeared again.  After waiting some time Mrs. Clements became alarmed, and ordered the cabman to  drive back to Lady Glyde's lodgings. When Lady Glyde's got there, after an absence of rather more  than half an hour, Anne Catherick was gone.  The only information to be obtained from the people of the house   was derived  from the servant who waited on the lodgers. Anne Catherick had opened the door to a boy  from the street, who had left a letter for "the young woman who lived on the  second floor" (the part of the house which Mrs. Clements occupied). the servant who waited on the lodgershad delivered a letter for "the young woman who lived on the  second floor" (the part of the house which Mrs. Clements occupied), had then gone downstairs, and five minutes afterwards  had observed Anne Catherick open the door and go out, dressed in Anne Catherick bonnet and  shawl. Anne Catherick had probably taken a letter for "the young woman who lived on the  second floor" (the part of the house which Mrs. Clements occupied) with Anne Catherick, for a letter for "the young woman who lived on the  second floor" (the part of the house which Mrs. Clements occupied) was not to be found,  and it was therefore impossible to tell what inducement had been offered to  make Anne Catherick leave the house  . It must have been a strong one, for Anne Catherick would never  stir out alone in London of Anne Catherick own accord. If Mrs. Clements had not known this  by experience nothing would have induced Mrs. Clements to go away in the cab, even for so  short a time as half an hour only.  As soon as Mrs. Clements could collect Mrs. Clements thoughts, the first idea that naturally  occurred to Mrs. Clements was to go and make inquiries at the Asylum, to which  Mrs. Clements dreaded that Anne Catherick had been taken back.  Mrs. Clements went there the next day, having been informed of the locality in which the  house was situated by Anne Catherick. The answer Mrs. Clements received (Mrs. Clements application  having in all probability been made a day or two before the false AnneCatherick had really been consigned to safe keeping in the Asylum) was, that no  such person had been brought back there. Mrs. Clements had then written to Anne  Catherickat Welmingham to know if Mrs. Clements had seen or heard anything of Mrs. Clements daughter, and  had received an answer in the negative. After that reply had reached Mrs. Clements, Mrs. Clements  was at the end of Mrs. Clements resources, and perfectly ignorant where else to inquire  or what else to do. From that time to this Mrs. Clements had remained in total ignorance  of the cause of Anne Catherick's disappearance and of the end of Anne Catherick's story.
