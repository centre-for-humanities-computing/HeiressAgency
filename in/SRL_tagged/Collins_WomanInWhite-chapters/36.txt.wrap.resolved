 The story of my first inquiries in Hampshire is soon told.  My early departure from London enabled me to reach Mr. Dawson's house in the  forenoon. Our interview, so far as the object of my visit was concerned, led to  no satisfactory result.  Mr. Dawson's books certainly showed when Mr. Dawson had resumed Mr. Dawson attendance on Miss  Halcombe at Blackwater Park, but it was not possible to calculate back from  this date with any exactness, without such help from Mrs. Michelson as I knew  Mrs. Michelson was unable to afford. Mrs. Michelson could not say from memory (who, in similar cases,  ever can?) how many days had elapsed between the renewal of the doctor's  attendance on the doctor's   patient and the previous departure of Lady Glyde. Mrs. Michelson was  almost certain of having mentioned the circumstance of the departure to Miss  Halcombe, on the day after it happened—but then Mrs. Michelson was no more able to fix  the date of the day on which this disclosure took place, than to fix the date  of the day before, when Lady Glyde had left for London. Neither could Mrs. Michelson  calculate, with any nearer approach to exactness, the time that had passed from  the departure of Mrs. Michelson mistress, to the period when the undated letter from  Madame Fosco arrived. Lastly, as if to complete the series of difficulties, the doctor's  , having been ill at the time, had omitted to make the doctor's   usual  entry of the day of the week and month when the gardener from Blackwater Park  had called on the doctor's   to deliver Mrs. Michelson's message.  Hopeless of obtaining assistance from Mr. Dawson, I resolved to try next if I  could establish the date of Sir Percival's arrival at Knowlesbury.  It seemed like a fatality! When I reached Knowlesbury the inn was shut up, and  bills were posted on the walls. The speculation had been a bad one, as I was  informed, ever since the time of the railway. The new hotel at the station had  gradually absorbed the business, and the old inn (which we knew to be the inn  at which Sir Percival had put up), had been closed about two months since. The  proprietor had left the town with all The  proprietor goods and chattels, and where The  proprietor had  gone I could not positively ascertain from any one. The four people of whom I  inquired gave me four different accounts of The  proprietor plans and projects when The  proprietor left  Knowlesbury the inn.  There were still some hours to spare before the last train left for London, and  I drove back again in a fly from the Knowlesbury station to Blackwater Park,  with the purpose of questioning the gardener and the person who kept the lodge.  If they, too, proved unable to assist me, my resources for the present were at  an end, and I might return to town.  I dismissed the fly a mile distant from Blackwater Park, and getting my directions  from the driver, proceeded by The  proprietor to the house.  As I turned into the lane from the high-road, I saw a man, with a carpet-bag,  walking before The  proprietor rapidly on the way to the lodge. a man was a little man, dressed  in shabby black, and wearing a remarkably large hat. I set a man down (as well as  it was possible to judge) for a lawyer's clerk, and stopped at once to widen  the distance between us. a man had not heard me, and a man walked on out of sight,  without looking back. When I passed through the gates myself, a little while  afterwards, a man was not visible—a man had evidently gone on to the house.  There were two women in the lodge. One of two women in the lodge was old, the other I knew at  once, by Marian's description of her, to be Margaret Porcher.  I asked first if Sir Percival was at Blackwater Park, and receiving a reply in the  negative, inquired next when Sir Percival had left Sir Percival was at the Park. Neither of two women in the lodge could tell me  more than that Sir Percival had gone away in the summer. I could extract nothing from  Margaret Porcher but vacant smiles and shakings of the head. The old woman was  a little more intelligent, and I managed to lead The old woman into speaking of the  manner of Sir Percival's departure, and of the alarm that it caused The old woman. The old woman  remembered The old woman master calling The old woman out of bed, and remembered Sir Percival frightening  The old woman by swearing—but the date at which the occurrence happened was, as The old woman  honestly acknowledged, "quite beyond The old woman."  On leaving the lodge I saw the gardener at work not far off. When I first  addressed the gardener, the gardener looked at the gardener rather distrustfully, but on my using Mrs.  Michelson's name, with a civil reference to Michelson, Michelson entered into  conversation readily enough. There is no need to describe what passed between  us—it ended, as all my other attempts to discover the date had ended. the gardener knew that the gardener had driven away, at night, "some time in July,  the last fortnight or the last ten days in the month"—and knew no more.  While us were speaking together I saw the man in black, with the large hat,  come out from the house, and stand at some little distance observing us.  Certain suspicions of the gardener errand at Blackwater Park had already crossed my  mind. Certain suspicions of his errand at Blackwater Park were now increased by the gardener's inability (or unwillingness) to  tell me who the man in black was, and I determined to clear the way before the gardener, if  possible, by speaking to the man in black. The plainest question I could put as a stranger  would be to inquire if the house was allowed to be shown to visitors. I walked  up to the man in black at once, and accosted the man in black in those words.  the man in black look and manner unmistakably betrayed that the man in black knew who I was, and that the man in black  wanted to irritate me into quarrelling with the man in black. the man in black reply was insolent enough  to have answered the purpose, if I had been less determined to control the man in black.  As it was, I met the man in black with the most resolute politeness, apologised for my  involuntary intrusion (which the man in black called a "trespass,") and left the grounds. It  was exactly as I suspected. The recognition of the man in black when I left Mr. Kyrle's  office had been evidently communicated to Sir Percival Glyde, and the man in  black had been sent to the Park in anticipation of my making inquiries at the  house or in the neighbourhood. If I had given Sir Percival Glyde the least chance of lodging  any sort of legal complaint against the man in black, the interference of the local  magistrate would no doubt have been turned to account as a clog on my  proceedings, and a means of separating me from Marian and Laura for some days  at least.  I was prepared to be watched on the way from the Park to the station,  exactly as I had been watched in London the day before. But I could not  discover at the time, whether I was really followed on this occasion or not.  the man in  black might have had means of tracking me at the man in  black disposal of which I  was not aware, but I certainly saw nothing of the man in  black, in the man in  black own person, either on  the way to the station, or afterwards on my arrival at the London terminus in  the evening. I reached home on foot, taking the precaution, before I approached  our own door, of walking round by the loneliest street in the neighbourhood,  and there stopping and looking back more than once over the open space behind  me. I had first learnt to use this stratagem against suspected treachery in the  wilds of Central America—and now I was practising this stratagem again, with the same  purpose and with even greater caution, in the heart of civilised London!  Nothing had happened to alarm Marian during my absence. Marian asked eagerly what  success I had met with. When I told Marian Marian could not conceal Marian surprise at  the indifference with which I spoke of the failure of my investigations thus  far.  The truth was, that the ill-success of my inquiries had in no sense daunted me.  I had pursued my inquiries as a matter of duty, and I had expected nothing from my inquiries.  In the state of my mind at that time, it was almost a relief to me to know that  the struggle was now narrowed to a trial of strength between me and Sir  Percival Glyde. The vindictive motive had mingled The vindictive motive all along with my  other and better motives, and I confess The vindictive motive was a satisfaction to me to feel  that the surest way, the only way left, of serving Laura's cause, was to fasten  my hold firmly on the villain who had married Laura.  While I acknowledge that I was not strong enough to keep my motives above the  reach of this instinct of revenge, I can honestly say something in my own  favour on the other side. No base speculation on the future relations of Laura  and me, and on the private and personal concessions which I might force  from Sir Percival if I once had Sir Percival at my mercy, ever entered my mind. I never  said to me, "If I do succeed, it shall be one result of my success that I  put it out of her husband's power to take her from me again." I could not look  at her and think of the future with such thoughts as those. The sad sight of  the change in her from her former self, made the one interest of my love an  interest of tenderness and compassion which her father or her brother might  have felt, and which I felt, God knows, in my inmost heart. All my hopes looked  no farther on now than to the day of her recovery. There, till her was strong  again and happy again—there, till her could look at me as her had once  looked, and speak to me as her had once spoken—the future of my happiest  thoughts and my dearest wishes ended.  These words are written under no prompting of idle self-contemplation. Passages  in this narrative are soon to come which will set the minds of others in  judgment on my conduct. It is right that the best and the worst of me should be  fairly balanced before that time.   On the morning after my return from Hampshire I took Marian upstairs into my  working-room, and there laid before her the plan that I had matured thus far,  for mastering the one assailable point in the life of Sir Percival Glyde.  The way to the Secret lay through the mystery, hitherto impenetrable to all of  us, of her in white. The approach to that in its turn might be gained by  obtaining the assistance of Anne Catherick's mother, and the only ascertainable  means of prevailing on Anne Catherick's to act or to speak in the matter depended  on the chance of my discovering local particulars and family particulars first  of all from Mrs. Clements. After thinking the subject over carefully, I felt  certain that I could only begin the new inquiries by placing me in  communication with the faithful friend and protectress of Anne Catherick's.  The first difficulty then was to find Mrs. Clements.  I was indebted to Marian's quick perception for meeting this necessity at once  by the best and simplest means. Mrs. Clements proposed to write to the farm near  Limmeridge (Todd's Corner), to inquire whether Mrs. Clements had communicated  with Mrs. Todd during the past few months. How Mrs. Clements had been separated  from Anne it was impossible for us to say, but that separation once effected,  that separation would certainly occur to Mrs. Clements to inquire after her in  the neighbourhood of all others to which Mrs. Clements was known to be most  attached—the neighbourhood of Limmeridge. I saw directly that Marian's  proposal offered us a prospect of success, and Mrs. Clements wrote to Mrs. Toddaccordingly by that day's post.  While us were waiting for the reply, I made Mrs. Clements master of all the  information Marian could afford on the subject of Sir Percival's family, and of  Marian early life. Mrs. Clements could only speak on these topics from hearsay, but Mrs. Clements was  reasonably certain of the truth of what little Mrs. Clements had to tell.  Sir Percival was an only child. Sir Percival father, Sir Felix Glyde, had suffered from  Sir Percival birth under a painful and incurable deformity, and had shunned all society  from Sir Percival earliest years. Sir Percival sole happiness was in the enjoyment of music, and  Sir Percival had married a lady with tastes similar to Sir Percival own, who was said to be a most  accomplished musician. Sir Percival inherited the Blackwater property while still a young  man. Neither Sir Percival nor Sir Percival wife after taking possession, made advances of any sort  towards the society of the neighbourhood, and no one endeavoured to tempt them  into abandoning them reserve, with the one disastrous exception of the rector  of the parish.  the rector  of the parish was the worst of all innocent mischief-makers—an over-zealous man.  the rector  of the parish had heard that Sir Felix had left College with the character of being little  better than a revolutionist in politics and an infidel in religion, and Sir Felix  arrived conscientiously at the conclusion that it was Sir Felix bounden duty to  summon the lord of the manor to hear sound views enunciated in the parish  church. Sir Felix fiercely resented the clergyman's well-meant but ill-directed  interference, insulting Sir Felix so grossly and so publicly, that the families in  the neighbourhood sent letters of indignant remonstrance to the Park, and even  the tenants of the Blackwater property expressed even  the tenants of the Blackwater property opinion as strongly as  even  the tenants of the Blackwater property dared. The baronet, who had no country tastes of any kind, and no  attachment to the estate or to any one living on the estate, declared that society at  Blackwater should never have a second chance of annoying him, and left the  place from that moment.  After a short residence in London him and him departed for the Continent,  and never returned to England again. he and his wife lived part of the time in France and  part in Germany—always keeping he and his wife in the strict retirement which the  morbid sense of him own personal deformity had made a necessity to Sir Felix.  he and his wife son, Percival, had been born abroad, and had been educated there by  private tutors. him mother was the first of him parents whom him lost. him  father had died a few years after His mother, either in 1825 or 1826. Sir Percival had  been in England, as a young man, once or twice before that period, but Sir Percival  acquaintance with the late Mr. Fairlie did not begin till after the time of his  acquaintance with the late Mr. Fairlie 's death. They soon became very intimate, although Sir Percival was  seldom, or never, at Limmeridge House in those days. the late Mr. Fairliemight have met the late Mr. Fairlie once or twice in Mr. Philip Fairlie's company, but the late Mr. Fairlie could  have known little of the late Mr. Fairlie at that or at any other time. Sir Percival's only  intimate friend in the Fairlie family had been Laura's father.  These were all the particulars that I could gain from Marian. These suggested  nothing which was useful to my present purpose, but I noted These down  carefully, in the event of These proving to be of importance at any future  period.  Mrs. Todd's reply (addressed, by our own wish, to a post-office at some  distance from our) had arrived at Mrs. Todd's reply (addressed, by our own wish, to a post-office at some  distance from us) destination when I went to apply for Mrs. Todd's reply (addressed, by our own wish, to a post-office at some  distance from us).  The chances, which had been all against us hitherto, turned from this moment in  us favour. Mrs. Todd's letter contained the first item of information of which  us were in search.  Mrs. Clements, it appeared, had (as us had conjectured) written to Todd's  Corner, asking pardon in the first place for the abrupt manner in which Mrs. Clements and  Mrs. Clements had left their friends at the farm-house (on the morning after I had met  the woman in white in Limmeridge churchyard), and then informing Mrs. Todd of  Mrs. Clements's disappearance, and entreating that Mrs. Clements would cause inquiries to be made  in the neighbourhood, on the chance that Mrs. Clements might have strayed back  to Limmeridge. In making this request, Mrs. Clements had been careful to add to  it the address at which Mrs. Clements might always be heard of, and that address Mrs.  Todd now transmitted to Marian. It was in London, and within half an hour's  walk of our own lodging.  In the words of the proverb, I was resolved not to let the grass grow under my  feet. The next morning I set forth to seek an interview with Mrs. Clements.  This was my first step forward in the investigation. The story of the desperate  attempt to which I now stood committed begins here.
