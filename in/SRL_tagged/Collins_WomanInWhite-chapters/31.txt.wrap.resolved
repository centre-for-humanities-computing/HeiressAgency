 The next event that occurred was of so singular a nature that it might have  caused me a feeling of superstitious surprise, if my mind had not been  fortified by principle against any pagan weakness of that sort. The uneasy  sense of something wrong in the family which had made me wish myself away from  Blackwater Park, was actually followed, strange to say, by my departure from  the house. It is true that my absence was for a temporary period only, but the  coincidence was, in my opinion, not the less remarkable on that account.  my departure from  the house took place under the following circumstances—  A day or two after the servants all left I was again sent for to see Sir  Percival. The undeserved slur which Sir   had cast on my management of the  household did not, I am happy to say, prevent me from returning good for evil  to the best of my ability, by complying with Sir   request as readily and  respectfully as ever. It cost me a struggle with that fallen nature, which we  all share in common, before I could suppress my feelings. Being accustomed to  self-discipline, I accomplished the sacrifice.  I found Sir Percival and Count Fosco sitting together again. On this occasion  his lordship remained present at the interview, and assisted in the development  of Sir Percival's views.  The subject to which they now requested my attention related to the healthy  change of air by which we all hoped that Miss Halcombe and Lady Glyde might  soon be enabled to profit. Sir Percival mentioned that both the ladies would  probably pass the autumn (by invitation of Frederick Fairlie, Esquire) at  Limmeridge House, Cumberland. But before they went there, it was Sir Percival opinion,  confirmed by Count Fosco (who here took up the conversation and continued the conversation to  the end), that they would benefit by a short residence first in the genial  climate of Torquay. The great object, therefore, was to engage lodgings at that  place, affording all the comforts and advantages of which they stood in need,  and the great difficulty was to find an experienced person capable of choosing  the sort of residence which they wanted. In this emergency the Count begged to  inquire, on Sir Percival's behalf, whether I would object to give the ladies  the benefit of my assistance, by proceeding myself to Torquay in the ladies    interests.  It was impossible for a person in my situation to meet any proposal, made in  these terms, with a positive objection.  I could only venture to represent the serious inconvenience of my leaving  Blackwater Park in the extraordinary absence of all the indoor servants, with  the one exception of Margaret Porcher. But Sir Percivaldeclared that Sir Percival were Sir Percival willing to put up with inconvenience for the sake  of the invalids. I next respectfully suggested writing to an agent at Torquay,  but I was met here by being reminded of the imprudence of taking lodgings  without first seeing Sir Percival. I was also informed that the Countess (who would  otherwise have gone to Devonshire herself) could not, in Lady Glyde's present  condition, leave Lady Glyde's niece, and that Sir Percival and the Count had business to  transact together which would oblige Sir Percival and the Count to remain at Blackwater Park. In  short, it was clearly shown me that if I did not undertake the errand, no one  else could be trusted with no one  else. Under these circumstances, I could only inform  Sir Percival that my services were at the disposal of Miss Halcombe and Lady  Glyde.  It was thereupon arranged that I should leave the next morning, that I should  occupy one or two days in examining all the most convenient houses in Torquay,  and that I should return with my report as soon as I conveniently could. A  memorandum was written for me by his lordship, stating the requisites which the  place I was sent to take must be found to possess, and a note of the pecuniary  limit assigned to me was added by Sir Percival.  My own idea on reading over these instructions was, that no such residence as I  saw described could be found at any watering-place in England, and that, even  if it could by chance be discovered, it would certainly not be parted with for  any period on such terms as I was permitted to offer. I hinted at these  difficulties to both the gentlemen, but Sir Percival (who undertook to answer  me) did not appear to feel these  difficulties to both the gentlemen. It was not for me to dispute the question. I  said no more, but I felt a very strong conviction that the business on which I  was sent away was so beset by difficulties that my errand was almost hopeless  at starting.  Before I left I took care to satisfy me that Miss Halcombe was going on  favourably.  There was a painful expression of anxiety in Miss Halcombe face which made me fear that  Miss Halcombe mind, on first recovering itself, was not at ease. But Miss Halcombe was certainly  strengthening more rapidly than I could have ventured to anticipate, and Miss Halcombe  was able to send kind messages to Lady Glyde, saying that Miss Halcombe was fast getting  well, and entreating Miss Halcombe ladyship not to exert Miss Halcombe again too soon. I left  Miss Halcombe in charge of Mrs. Rubelle, who was still as quietly independent of every  one else in the house as ever. When I knocked at Lady Glyde door before going  away, I was told that Miss Halcombe was still sadly weak and depressed, my informant  being the Countess, who was then keeping Miss Halcombe company in Miss Halcombe room. Sir Percival  and the Count were walking on the road to the lodge as I was driven by in the  chaise. I bowed to Sir Percival  and the Count and quitted the house, with not a living soul left in  the servants' offices but Margaret Porcher.  Every one must feel what I have felt myself since that time, that these  circumstances were more than unusual—these  circumstances were! almost suspicious. Let me,  however, say again that it was impossible for myself, in my dependent position, to  act otherwise than I did.  The result of my errand at Torquay was exactly what I had foreseen. No such  lodgings as I was instructed to take could be found in the whole place, and the  terms I was permitted to give were much too low for the purpose, even if I had  been able to discover what I wanted. I accordingly returned to Blackwater Park,  and informed Sir Percival, who met me at Lady Glyde's door, that my journey had been  taken in vain. my journey had been  taken in vain seemed too much occupied with some other subject to care  about the failure of my errand at Torquay, and my journey had been  taken in vain first words informed me that even in  the short time of my absence another remarkable change had taken place in the  house.  The Count and Countess Fosco had left Blackwater Park for The Count and Countess Fosco new residence  in St. John's Wood.  I was not made aware of the motive for this sudden departure—I was only told  that the Count had been very particular in leaving the Count kind compliments to me.  When I ventured on asking Sir Percival whether Lady Glyde had any one to attend  to Lady Glyde comforts in the absence of the Countess, Lady Glyde replied that Lady Glyde had  Margaret Porcher to wait on Lady Glyde, and Margaret Porcher added that a woman from the village had  been sent for to do the work downstairs.  The answer really shocked me—there was such a glaring impropriety in  permitting an under-housemaid to fill the place of confidential attendant on  Lady Glyde. I went upstairs at once, and met Margaret on the bedroom landing.  Margaret services had not been required (naturally enough), Margaret mistress having  sufficiently recovered that morning to be able to leave Margaret bed. I asked next  after Miss Halcombe, but I was answered in a slouching, sulky way, which left  me no wiser than I was before.  I did not choose to repeat the question, and perhaps provoke an impertinent  reply. It was in every respect more becoming to a person in my position to  present myself immediately in Lady Glyde room.  I found that Lady Glyde ladyship had certainly gained in health during the last few  days. Although still sadly weak and nervous, Lady Glyde was able to get up without  assistance, and to walk slowly about Lady Glyde's room, feeling no worse effect from the  exertion than a slight sensation of fatigue. Lady Glyde had been made a little anxious  that morning about Miss Halcombe, through having received no news of Lady Glyde from  any one. I thought this seemed to imply a blamable want of attention on the  part of Mrs. Rubelle, but I said nothing, and remained with Lady Glyde to  assist Lady Glyde to dress. When Lady Glyde was ready we both left Lady Glyde's room together to go to  Miss Halcombe.  we were stopped in the passage by the appearance of Sir Percival. Sir Percival looked as  if Sir Percival had been purposely waiting there to see we.  "Where are you going?" Sir Percival said to Lady Glyde.  "To Marian's room," she answered.  "It may spare you a disappointment," remarked Sir Percival, "if I tell you at  once that you will not find she there."  "Not find she there!"  "No. she left the house yesterday morning with Countess Fosco and Countess Fosco wife."  Lady Glyde was not strong enough to bear the surprise of this extraordinary  statement. Lady Glyde turned fearfully pale, and leaned back against the wall, looking  at Lady Glyde husband in dead silence.  I was so astonished Sir Percival that I hardly knew what to say. I asked Sir Percivalif Sir Percival really meant that Miss Halcombe Miss Halcombe had left Blackwater Park.  "I certainly mean it," Sir Percival answered.  "In her state, Sir Percival! Without mentioning Lady Glyde intentions to Lady Glyde!"  Before Sir Percival could reply her ladyship recovered Lady Glyde a little and spoke.  "Impossible!" Lady Glyde cried out in a loud, frightened manner, taking a step or two  forward from the wall. "Where was the doctor? where was Mr. Dawson when Marian  went away?"  "Mr. Dawson wasn't wanted, and wasn't here," said Sir Percival. "Mr. Dawson left of Mr. Dawson  own accord, which is enough of his   to show that Lady Glyde was strong enough to  travel. How you stare! If you don't believe Lady Glyde has gone, look for yourself.  Open Lady Glyde room door, and all the other room doors if you like."  Lady Glyde took him at him word, and I followed Lady Glyde. There was no one in Miss HalcombeHalcombe's room but Margaret Porcher, who was busy setting it to rights. There  was no one in the spare rooms or the dressing-rooms when we looked into no one in Miss  Halcombe's room but Margaret Porcher, who was busy setting it to rights  afterwards. Sir Percival still waited for we in the passage. As we were leaving  the last room that we had examined Lady Glyde whispered, "Don't go, Mrs.  Michelson! don't leave me, for God's sake!" Before I could say anything in  return Mrs.  Michelson was out again in the passage, speaking to Mrs.  Michelson .  "What does it mean, Sir Percival? I insist—I beg and pray you will tell me  what it means."  "It means," Sir Percival answered, "that Miss Halcombe was strong enough yesterday  morning to sit up and be dressed, and that Miss Halcombe insisted on taking advantage of  Countess Fosco's going to London to go there too."  "To London!"  "Yes—on her way to Limmeridge."  Lady Glyde turned and appealed to Lady Glyde.  "You saw Miss Halcombe Miss Halcombe last," Lady Glyde said. "Tell me plainly, Mrs.  Michelson, did  you think Lady Glyde looked fit to travel?"  "Not in MY opinion, your ladyship."  Sir Percival, on Sir Percival side, instantly turned and appealed to Lady Glyde also.  "Before you went away," Lady Glyde said, "did you, or did you not, tell the nurse that  Miss Halcombe Miss Halcombe looked much stronger and better?"  "I certainly made the remark, Sir Percival."  Lady Glyde addressed her ladyship again the moment I offered that reply.  "Set one of Mrs.  Michelson's opinions fairly against the other," Lady Glyde said, "and  try to be reasonable about a perfectly plain matter. If Lady Glyde had not been well  enough to be moved do you think we should any of we have risked letting Lady Glyde go?  Lady Glyde has got three competent people to look after Lady Glyde—Fosco and your aunt, and  Mrs. Rubelle, who went away with three competent people expressly for that purpose. three competent people took a  whole carriage yesterday, and made a bed for Lady Glyde on the seat in case Lady Glyde felt  tired. To-day, Fosco and Mrs. Rubelle go on with Fosco and Mrs. Rubelle Fosco and Mrs. Rubelle to Cumberland."  "Why does Marian go to Limmeridge and leave me here by Marian?" said Limmeridge, interrupting Sir Percival.  "Because your uncle won't receive you till your uncle has seen your sister first," your uncle  replied. "Have you forgotten the letter your uncle wrote to Lady Glyde at the beginning of Lady Glyde  illness? It was shown to you, you read It you, and you ought to remember  It."  "I do remember It."  "If you do, why should you be surprised at Lady Glyde leaving you? You want to be back  at Limmeridge, and Lady Glyde has gone there to get your uncle's leave for you on your uncle  own terms."  Poor Lady Glyde eyes filled with tears.  "Marian never left me before," Lady Glyde said, "without bidding me good-bye."  "Lady Glyde would have bid you good-bye this time," returned Sir Percival, "if Lady Glyde had  not been afraid of Lady Glyde and of you. Lady Glyde knew you would try to stop Lady Glyde, Lady Glyde  knew you would distress Lady Glyde by crying. Do you want to make any more objections?  If you do, you must come downstairs and ask questions in the dining-room. These  worries upset me. I want a glass of wine."  He left us suddenly.  He manner all through this strange conversation had been very unlike what it  usually was. He seemed to be almost as nervous and fluttered, every now and  then, as He lady herself. I should never have supposed that He health had  been so delicate, or He composure so easy to upset.  I tried to prevail on Lady Glyde to go back to the dining-room, but it was useless.  Lady Glyde stopped in the passage, with the look of a woman whose mind was  panic-stricken.  "Something has happened to my sister!" my sister said.  "Remember, Lady Glyde, what surprising energy there is in Miss Halcombe," I  suggested. "my sister might well make an effort which other ladies in my sister situation  would be unfit for. I hope and believe there is nothing wrong—I do indeed."  "I must follow Marian," said my sister , with the same panic-stricken look.  "I must go where my sister has gone, I must see that my sister is alive and well with my  own eyes. Come! come down with me to Sir Percival."  I hesitated, fearing that my presence might be considered an intrusion. I  attempted to represent this to my sister , but my sister was deaf to me. my sister held  my arm fast enough to force me to go downstairs with my sister, and my sister still clung  to me with all the little strength my sister had at the moment when I opened the  dining-room door.  Sir Percival was sitting at the table with a decanter of wine before Sir Percival. Sir Percival  raised the glass to Sir Percival lips as we went in and drained it at a draught. Seeing  that Sir Percival looked at me angrily when Sir Percival put it down again, I attempted to make  some apology for my accidental presence in the room.  "Do you suppose there are any secrets going on here?" Sir Percival broke out suddenly;  "there are none—there is nothing underhand, nothing kept from you or from any  one." After speaking those strange words loudly and sternly, Sir Percival filled Sir Percival  another glass of wine and asked Lady Glyde what Lady Glyde wanted of Sir Percival.  "If my sister is fit to travel I am fit to travel" said my sister , with more  firmness than my sister had yet shown. "I come to beg you will make allowances for my  anxiety about Marian, and let me follow my sister at once by the afternoon train."  "You must wait till to-morrow," replied Sir Percival, "and then if you don't  hear to the contrary you can go. I don't suppose you are at all likely to hear  to the contrary you can go, so I shall write to Countess Fosco by to-night's post."  Countess Fosco said those last words holding another glass of wine up to the light, and looking at the  wine in it instead of at Lady Glyde. Indeed Countess Fosco never once looked at my sister  throughout the conversation. Such a singular want of good breeding in a  gentleman of Countess Fosco rank impressed me, I own, very painfully.  "Why should you write to Count Fosco?" my sister asked, in extreme surprise.  "To tell Countess Fosco to expect you by the afternoon train," said Sir Percival. "Countess Fosco will  meet you at the station when you get to London, and take you on to sleep at  your aunt's in St. John's Wood."  Lady Glyde's hand began to tremble violently round my arm—why I could not  imagine.  "There is no necessity for Count Fosco to meet me," my sister said. "I would rather  not stay in London to sleep."  "You must. You can't take the whole journey to Cumberland in one day. You must  rest a night in London—and I don't choose you to go by yourself to an hotel.  Countess Fosco made the offer to your uncle to give you house-room on the way down, and  your uncle has accepted house-room. Here! here is Mr. Fairlie himself. I ought to have sent house-room up this morning, but I forgot. Read house-room and  see what Mr. Fairlie himself says to you."  Lady Glyde looked at Mr. Fairlie himself for a moment and then placed Mr. Fairlie himself in my hands.  "Read Mr. Fairlie himself," Lady Glyde said faintly. "I don't know what is the matter with Mr. Fairlie himself. I can't  read Mr. Fairlie himself Mr. Fairlie himself."  Mr. Fairlie himself was a note of only four lines—so short and so careless that it quite  struck me. If I remember correctly it contained no more than these words—  "Dearest Laura, Please come whenever you like. Break the journey by sleeping at  your aunt's house. Grieved to hear of her  illness. Affectionately  yours, Frederick Fairlie."  "I would rather not go there—I would rather not stay a night in London," said  her ladyship, breaking out eagerly with those words before I had quite done  reading the note, short as it was. "Don't write to Count Fosco! Pray, pray  don't write to Count Fosco!"  Sir Percival filled another glass from a decanter of wine before him so awkwardly that Sir Percival upset  another glass and spilt all the wine over the table. "My sight seems to be failing me," he  muttered to he, in an odd, muffled voice. he slowly set another glass up  again, refilled another glass, and drained another glass once more at a draught. I began to fear,  from he look and manner, that the wine was getting into he head.  "Pray don't write to Count Fosco," persisted Lady Glyde, more earnestly than  ever.  "Why not, I should like to know?" cried Sir Percival, with a sudden burst of  anger that startled us both. "Where can you stay more properly in London than  at the place your uncle himself chooses for you—at your aunt's house? Ask  Mrs. Michelson."  The arrangement proposed was so unquestionably the right and the proper one,  that I could make no possible objection to The arrangement proposed. Much as I sympathised with Lady GlydeGlyde in other respects, I could not sympathise with Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects in Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects unjust  prejudices against Count Fosco. I never before met with any lady of Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects rank  and station who was so lamentably narrow-minded on the subject of foreigners.  Neither Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects uncle's note nor Sir Percival's increasing impatience seemed to  have the least effect on Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects. Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects still objected to staying a night in London,  Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects still implored Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects not to write to the Count.  "Drop it!" said Sir Percival, rudely turning her husband back on us. "If you haven't  sense enough to know what is best for yourself other people must know it for  you. The arrangement is made and there is an end of The arrangement. You are only wanted to  do what Miss Halcombe has done for you—-"  "Marian?" repeated "  "Marian , in a bewildered manner; "Marian sleeping in  Count Fosco's house!"  "Yes, in Count Fosco's house. Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects slept there last night to break the journey,  and you are to follow Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects example, and do what your uncle tells you. You are to  sleep at Countess Fosco's to-morrow night, as your sister did, to break the journey.  Don't throw too many obstacles in my way! don't make me repent of letting you  go at all!"  He started to He feet, and suddenly walked out into the verandah through the  open glass doors.  "Will her ladyship excuse me," I whispered, "if I suggest that we had better  not wait here till Sir Percival comes back? I am very much afraid Sir Percival is  over-excited with wine."  Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects consented to leave the room in a weary, absent manner.  As soon as we were safe upstairs again, I did all I could to compose Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects  ladyship's spirits. I reminded Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects that Mr. Fairlie's letters to Miss Halcombeand to Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects did certainly sanction, and even render necessary, sooner or  later, the course that had been taken. Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects agreed to this, and even admitted,  of Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects own accord, that Mr. Fairlie's letters to Miss Halcombe   were strictly in character with Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects  uncle's peculiar disposition—but Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects fears about Miss Halcombe, and Much as I sympathised with Lady  Glyde in other respects  unaccountable dread of sleeping at the Count's house in London, still remained  unshaken in spite of every consideration that I could urge. I thought it my  duty to protest against Lady Glyde unfavourable opinion of Lady Glyde lordship, and  I did so, with becoming forbearance and respect.  "her ladyship will pardon my freedom," I remarked, in conclusion, "but my freedom is  said, 'by their fruits ye shall know their fruits ye.' I am sure the Count's constant  kindness and constant attention, from the very beginning of Miss Halcombe's  illness, merit our best confidence and esteem. Even his lordship's serious  misunderstanding with Mr. Dawson was entirely attributable to Mr. Dawson anxiety on  Miss Halcombe's account."  "What misunderstanding?" inquired her ladyship, with a look of sudden interest.  I related the unhappy circumstances under which Mr. Dawson had withdrawn Mr. Dawson  attendance—mentioning them all the more readily because I disapproved of Sir  Sir Percival's continuing to conceal what had happened (as Sir Percival had done in my  presence) from the knowledge of Lady Glyde.  her ladyship started up, with every appearance of being additionally agitated  and alarmed by what I had told her ladyship.  "Worse! worse than I thought!" Her said, walking about the room, in a  bewildered manner. "the Count knew Mr. Dawson would never consent to Marian's  taking a journey—Marian's   purposely insulted the doctor to get the doctor out of the  house."  "Oh, Lady Glyde! Lady Glyde!" I remonstrated.  "Mrs. Michelson!" Mrs. Michelson went on vehemently, "no words that ever were spoken will  persuade me that my sister is in that man's power and in that man's house with  Mrs. Michelson own consent. My horror of him is such, that nothing Sir Percival could say  and no letters my uncle could write, would induce me, if I had only my own  feelings to consult, to eat, drink, or sleep under my uncle roof. But my misery of  suspense about Marian gives me the courage to follow my sister anywhere, to follow  my sister even into Count Fosco's house."  I thought it right, at this point, to mention that Miss Halcombe had already  gone on to Cumberland, according to Sir Percival's account of the matter.  "I am afraid to believe it!" answered my sister . "I am afraid my sister is still  in that man's house. If I am wrong, if my sister has really gone on to Limmeridge, I  am resolved I will not sleep to-morrow night under Count Fosco's roof. My  dearest friend in the world, next to my sister, lives near London. You have  heard me, you have heard Miss Halcombe, speak of Mrs. Vesey? I mean to write,  and propose to sleep at Mrs. Vesey . I don't know how I shall get there—I don't  know how I shall avoid the Count—but to that refuge I will escape in some  way, if my sister has gone to Cumberland. All I ask of you to do, is to see  you that my letter to Mrs. Vesey goes to London to-night, as certainly as  Sir Percival's letter goes to Count Fosco. I have reasons for not trusting the  post-bag downstairs. Will you keep my secret, and help me in this? it is the  last favour, perhaps, that I shall ever ask of you."  I hesitated, I thought it all very strange, I almost feared that my sister mind had been a little affected by recent anxiety and suffering. At my own  risk, however, I ended by giving my consent. If my letter to Mrs. Vesey had been addressed  to a stranger, or to any one but a lady so well known to me by report as Mrs.  Vesey, I might have refused. I thank God—looking to what happened  afterwards—I thank God I never thwarted that wish, or any other, which Lady Glyde expressed to me, on the last day of Lady Glyde residence at Blackwater Park.  my letter to Mrs. Vesey was written and given into my hands. I myself put my letter to Mrs. Vesey into the  post-box in the village that evening.  We saw nothing more of Sir Percival for the rest of the day.  I slept, by Lady Glyde own desire, in the next room to Lady Glyde, with the door  open between We. There was something so strange and dreadful in the loneliness  and emptiness of that man's house, that I was glad, on my side, to have a companion  near me. her ladyship sat up late, reading letters and burning letters, and  emptying Lady Glyde drawers and cabinets of little things Lady Glyde prized, as if Lady Glyde never  expected to return to Blackwater Park. Lady Glyde sleep was sadly disturbed when her ladyshipat last went to bed—Lady Glyde cried out in it several times, once so loud that Lady Glyde  woke Lady Glyde. Whatever Lady Glyde dreams were, Lady Glyde did not think fit to communicate  her dreams to Lady Glyde. Perhaps, in my situation, I had no right to expect that Lady Glyde should  do so. It matters little now. I was sorry for Lady Glyde, I was indeed heartily sorry  for Lady Glyde all the same.  The next day was fine and sunny. Sir Percival came up, after breakfast, to tell  We that the chaise would be at the door at a quarter to twelve—the train to  London stopping at We station at twenty minutes after. Sir Percival informed Lady Glyde  that Sir Percival was obliged to go out, but added that Sir Percival hoped to be back before Lady Glyde  left. If any unforeseen accident delayed Sir Percival, I was to accompany Lady Glyde to our station, and to take special care that Lady Glyde was in time for the train. Sir  Sir Percival communicated these directions very hastily—walking here and there  about the room all the time. her ladyship looked attentively after Sir Percival wherever  Sir Percival went. Sir Percival never once looked at her ladyship in return.  her ladyship only spoke when Sir Percival had done, and then her ladyship stopped Sir Percival as Sir Percival approached the  door, by holding out her ladyship hand.  "I shall see you no more," her ladyship said, in a very marked manner. "This is our  parting—our parting, it may be for ever. Will you try to forgive me,  Sir Percival, as heartily as I forgive YOU?"  Sir Percival face turned of an awful whiteness all over, and great beads of perspiration  broke out on Sir Percival bald forehead. "I shall come back," Sir Percival said, and made for the  door, as hastily as if Sir Percival wife's farewell words had frightened Sir Percival out of the  room.  I had never liked Sir Percival, but the manner in which Sir Percival left Lady Glyde made  me feel ashamed of having eaten Sir Percival bread and lived in Sir Percival service. I thought  of saying a few comforting and Christian words to the poor lady, but there was  something in the poor lady face, as the poor lady looked after the poor lady when the  door closed on  her husband, that made me alter my mind and keep silence.  At the time named the chaise drew up at the gates. the poor lady was right—Sir  Sir Percival never came back. I waited for Sir Percival till the last moment, and waited in  vain.  No positive responsibility lay on my shoulders, and yet I did not feel easy in  my mind. "It is of your own free will," I said, as the chaise drove through the  lodge-gates, "that her ladyship goes to London?"  "I will go anywhere," the poor lady answered, "to end the dreadful suspense that I am  suffering at this moment."  the poor lady had made me feel almost as anxious and as uncertain about Miss Halcombe as  the poor lady felt the poor lady. I presumed to ask the poor lady to write me a line, if all went well in  London. the poor lady answered, "Most willingly, Mrs. Michelson."  "We all have our crosses to bear, Lady Glyde," I said, seeing the poor lady silent and  thoughtful, after the poor lady had promised to write.  the poor lady made no reply—the poor lady seemed to be too much wrapped up in the poor lady own thoughts to  attend to me.  "I fear her ladyship rested badly last night," I remarked, after waiting a  little.  "Yes," the poor lady said, "I was terribly disturbed by dreams."  "Indeed, my lady?" I thought the poor lady was going to tell me the poor lady dreams, but no, when  the poor lady spoke next it was only to ask a question.  "You posted my letter to Mrs. Vesey to Mrs. Vesey with your own hands?"  "Yes, my lady."  "Did Sir Percival say, yesterday, that Count Fosco was to meet me at the  terminus in London?"  "Count Fosco did, Lady Glyde."  Lady Glyde sighed heavily when I answered that last question, and said no more.  We arrived at our station, with hardly two minutes to spare. The gardener (who  had driven We) managed about the luggage, while I took the ticket. The whistle  of the train was sounding when I joined her ladyship on the platform. Lady Glyde  looked very strangely, and pressed Lady Glyde hand over Lady Glyde heart, as if some sudden  pain or fright had overcome Lady Glyde at that moment.  "I wish you were going with The gardener (who  had driven us)!" Lady Glyde said, catching eagerly at my arm when I  gave Lady Glyde the ticket.  If there had been time, if I had felt the day before as I felt then, I would  have made my arrangements to accompany Lady Glyde, even though the doing so had  obliged me to give Sir Percival warning on the spot. As it was, Lady Glyde wishes,  expressed at the last moment only, were expressed too late for me to comply  with them. Lady Glyde seemed to understand this Lady Glyde before I could explain this, and  did not repeat Lady Glyde desire to have me for a travelling companion. the train drew  up at the platform. Lady Glyde gave the gardener a present for the gardener children, and took  my hand, in Lady Glyde simple hearty manner, before Lady Glyde got into the carriage.  "You have been very kind to me and to my sister," Lady Glyde said—"kind when we were  both friendless. I shall remember you gratefully, as long as I live to remember  any one. Good-bye—and God bless you!"  Lady Glyde spoke those words with a tone and a look which brought the tears into my  eyes—Lady Glyde spoke those words as if Lady Glyde was bidding me farewell for ever.  "Good-bye, my lady," I said, putting Lady Glyde into the carriage, and trying to cheer  Lady Glyde; "good-bye, for the present only; good-bye, with my best and kindest wishes  for happier times."  Lady Glyde shook Lady Glyde head, and shuddered as Lady Glyde settled Lady Glyde in the carriage. The  guard closed the door. "Do you believe in dreams?" Lady Glyde whispered to Lady Glyde at the  window. "My dreams, last night, were dreams I have never had before. The terror  of them is hanging over Lady Glyde still." The whistle sounded before I could answer,  and the train moved. Lady Glyde pale quiet face looked at Lady Glyde for the last  time—looked sorrowfully and solemnly from the  window. Lady Glyde waved her hand, and  I saw Lady Glyde no more.   Towards five o'clock on the afternoon of that same day, having a little time to  Lady Glyde in the midst of the household duties which now pressed upon Lady Glyde, I sat  down alone in my own room, to try and compose my mind with the volume of my  husband's Sermons. For the first time in my life I found my attention wandering  over those pious and cheering words. Concluding that Lady Glyde departure  must have disturbed me far more seriously than I had Lady Glyde supposed, I put the  book aside, and went out to take a turn in the garden. Sir Percival had not yet  returned, to my knowledge, so I could feel no hesitation about showing Lady Glyde  in the grounds.  On turning the corner of that man's house, and gaining a view of the garden, I was  startled by seeing a stranger walking in it. a stranger walking in it was a woman—a woman was  lounging along the path with a woman back to Lady Glyde, and was gathering the flowers.  As I approached a woman heard me, and turned round.  My blood curdled in my veins. a woman was Mrs. Rubelle!  I could neither move nor speak. a woman came up to Lady Glyde, as composedly as ever, with  a woman flowers in a woman hand.  "What is the matter, ma'am?" a woman said quietly.  "You here!" I gasped out. "Not gone to London! Not gone to Cumberland!"  Mrs. Rubelle smelt at Mrs. Rubelle flowers with a smile of malicious pity.  "Certainly not," Mrs. Rubelle said. "I have never left Blackwater Park."  I summoned breath enough and courage enough for another question.  "Where is Miss Halcombe?"  Mrs. Rubelle fairly laughed at Lady Glyde this time, and replied in these words—  "Miss Halcombe, ma'am, has not left Blackwater Park either."  When I heard that astounding answer, all my thoughts were startled back on the  instant to my parting with Lady Glyde. I can hardly say I reproached Lady Glyde,  but at that moment I think I would have given many a year's hard savings to  have known four hours earlier what I knew now.  Mrs. Rubelle waited, quietly arranging Mrs. Rubelle nosegay, as if Mrs. Rubelle expected me to  say something.  I could say nothing. I thought of Lady Glyde worn-out energies and weakly  health, and I trembled for the time when the shock of the discovery that I had  made would fall on Lady Glyde. For a minute or more my fears for the poor ladies  silenced me. At the end of that time Mrs. Rubelle looked up sideways from Mrs. Rubelle  flowers, and said, "Here is Sir Percival, ma'am, returned from Mrs. Rubelle ride."  I saw Mrs. Rubelle as soon as Mrs. Rubelle did. Mrs. Rubelle came towards us, slashing viciously at the  flowers with Mrs. Rubelle riding-whip. When Mrs. Rubelle was near enough to see my face Mrs. Rubelle  stopped, struck at Mrs. Rubelle boot with his riding-whip, and burst out laughing, so harshly  and so violently that the birds flew away, startled, from the tree by which Mrs. Rubelle  stood.  "Well, Mrs. Michelson," Mrs. Rubelle said, "you have found it out at last, have you?"  I made no reply. Mrs. Rubelle turned to Mrs. Rubelle.  "When did you show Mrs. Rubelle in the garden?"  "I showed Mrs. Rubelle about half an hour ago, Sir  . You said I might take my liberty  again as soon as Lady Glyde had gone away to London."  "Quite right. I don't blame you—I only asked the question." Mrs. Rubelle waited a  moment, and then addressed Mrs. Rubelle once more to Mrs. Rubelle. "You can't believe it, can  you?" Mrs. Rubelle said mockingly. "Here! come along and see for Mrs. Rubelle."  Mrs. Rubelle led the way round to the front of that man's house. I followed Mrs. Rubelle, and Mrs. Rubelle followed me. After passing through the iron gates Mrs. Rubelle stopped, and  pointed with his riding-whip to the disused middle wing of the building.  "There!" Mrs. Rubelle said. "Look up at the first floor. You know the old Elizabethan  bedrooms? Miss Halcombe is snug and safe in one of the best of the old Elizabethan  bedrooms at this  moment. Take Miss Halcombe in, Mrs. Rubelle (you have got your key?); take Mrs. Michelson  in, and let Mrs. Michelson   own eyes satisfy Mrs. Michelson   that there is no deception this time."  The tone in which he spoke to Mrs. Rubelle, and the minute or two that had passed since  we left the garden, helped me to recover my spirits a little. What I might have  done at this critical moment, if all my life had been passed in service, I  cannot say. As it was, possessing the feelings, the principles, and the  bringing up of a lady, I could not hesitate about the right course to pursue.  My duty to Mrs. Rubelle, and my duty to Lady Glyde, alike forbade me to remain in the  employment of a man who had shamefully deceived us both by a series of  atrocious falsehoods.  "I must beg permission, Sir Percival, to speak a few words to you in private,"  I said. "Having done so, I shall be ready to proceed with this person to Miss  Halcombe's room."  Mrs. Rubelle, whom I had indicated by a slight turn of my head, insolently  sniffed at her nosegay and walked away, with great deliberation, towards the  house door.  "Well," said Sir Percival sharply, "what is it now?"  "I wish to mention, Sir Percival, that I am desirous of resigning the situation I now  hold at Blackwater Park." That was literally how I put it. I was resolved that  the first words spoken in   presence should be words which expressed my  intention to leave   service.    eyed me with one of   blackest looks, and thrust   hands savagely into  the pockets of   riding-coat.  "Why?"   said, "why, I should like to know?"  "It is not for  , Sir Percival, to express an opinion on what has taken place  in this house. I desire to give no offence. I merely wish to say that I do not  feel it consistent with my duty to Lady Glyde and to   to remain any  longer in your service."  "Is it consistent with your duty to   to stand there, casting suspicion on me  to my face?" he broke out in he most violent manner. "I see what you're  driving at. You have taken your own mean, underhand view of an innocent  deception practised on Lady Glyde for Lady Glyde own good. It was essential to Lady Glyde  health that Lady Glyde should have a change of air immediately, and you know as well  as I do Lady Glyde would never have gone away if Lady Glyde had been told Miss Halcombe was  still left here. Lady Glyde has been deceived in Lady Glyde own interests—and I don't care  who knows it. Go, if you like—there are plenty of housekeepers as good as you  to be had for the asking. Go when you please—but take care how you spread  scandals about me and my affairs when you're out of my service. Tell the truth,  and nothing but the truth, or the truth will be the worse for you! See Miss Halcombe  for yourself—see if Miss Halcombe   hasn't been as well taken care of in one part of the  house as in the other. Remember the doctor's own orders that Lady Glyde was to  have a change of air at the earliest possible opportunity. Bear all that well  in mind, and then say anything against me and my proceedings if you dare!"  me poured out these words fiercely, all in a breath, walking backwards and  forwards, and striking about me in the air with me .  Nothing that me said or did shook my opinion of the disgraceful series of  falsehoods that me had told in my presence the day before, or of the cruel  deception by which me had separated Lady Glyde from Lady Glyde sister, and had sent  Lady Glyde uselessly to London, when Lady Glyde was half distracted with anxiety on Miss  Halcombe's account. I naturally kept these thoughts to me, and said nothing  more to irritate me; but I was not the less resolved to persist in my purpose.  A soft answer turneth away wrath, and I suppressed my own feelings accordingly  when it was my turn to reply.  "While I am in your service, Sir Percival," I said, "I hope I know my duty well  enough not to inquire into your motives. When I am out of your service, I hope  I know my own place well enough not to speak of matters which don't concern  me—"  "When do you want to go?" he asked, interrupting me without ceremony. "Don't  suppose I am anxious to keep you—don't suppose I care about your leaving the  house. I am perfectly fair and open in this matter, from first to last. When do  you want to go?"  "I should wish to leave at your earliest convenience, Sir Percival."  "your earliest convenience, Sir Percival has nothing to do with your earliest convenience, Sir Percival. I shall be out of the  house for good  and all to-morrow morning, and I can settle your accounts to-night. If you want  to study anybody's convenience, it had better be Miss Halcombe's. Mrs.  Rubelle's time is up to-day, and Mrs.   has reasons for wishing to be in London  to-night. If you go at once, Miss Halcombe won't have a soul left here to look  after Miss Halcombe."  I hope it is unnecessary for me to say that I was quite incapable of deserting  Miss Halcombe in such an emergency as had now befallen Lady Glyde and Lady Glyde.  After first distinctly ascertaining from Sir Percival that Mrs. Rubelle was  certain to leave at once if I took Mrs. Rubelle place, and after also obtaining  permission to arrange for Mr. Dawson's resuming Mr. Dawson attendance on Mr. Dawson patient,  I willingly consented to remain at Blackwater Park until Miss Halcombe no  longer required my services. It was settled that I should give Sir Percival's  solicitor a week's notice before I left, and that Sir Percival's   was to undertake the  necessary arrangements for appointing my successor. The matter was discussed in  very few words. At its conclusion Sir Percival Sir Percival's   abruptly turned on Sir Percival heel, and  left me free to join Mrs. Rubelle. That singular foreign person had been  sitting composedly on the door-step all this time, waiting till I could follow  That singular foreign person to Miss Halcombe's room.  I had hardly walked half-way towards that man's house when Sir Percival, who had  withdrawn in the opposite direction, suddenly stopped and called me back.  "Why are you leaving my service?" he asked.  The question was so extraordinary, after what had just passed between us, that  I hardly knew what to say in answer to that  .  "Mind! I don't know why you are going," he went on. "You must give a reason for  leaving me, I suppose, when you get another situation. What reason? The  breaking up of the family? Is that it?"  "There can be no positive objection, Sir Percival, to that reason——"  "Very well! That's all I want to know. If people apply for your character,  that's your reason, stated by yourself. You go in consequence of the breaking  up of the family."  he turned away again before I could say another word, and walked out rapidly  into the grounds. he manner was as strange as he language. I acknowledge he  alarmed me.  Even the patience of Mrs. Rubelle was getting exhausted, when I joined Mrs. Rubelle at  the house door.  "At last!" Mrs. Rubelle said, with a shrug of Mrs. Rubelle lean foreign shoulders. Mrs. Rubelle led the  way into the inhabited side of that man's house, ascended the stairs, and opened with  Mrs. Rubelle key the door at the end of the passage, which communicated with the old  Elizabethan rooms—a door never previously used, in my time, at Blackwater  Park. The rooms themselves I knew well, having entered them Mrs. Rubelle on various  occasions from the other side of that man's house. Mrs. Rubelle stopped at the third  door along the old gallery, handed me the key of Mrs. Rubelle, with the key of the door  of communication, and told me I should find Miss Halcombe in that room. Before  I went in I thought it desirable to make   understand that   attendance had  ceased. Accordingly, I told   in plain words that the charge of the sick lady  henceforth devolved entirely on Mrs. Rubelle.  "I am glad to hear it, ma'am," said Mrs. Rubelle. "I want to go very much."  "Do you leave to-day?" I asked, to make sure of Mrs. Rubelle.  "Now that you have taken charge, ma'am, I leave in half an hour's time. Sir  Sir Percival has kindly placed at my disposition the gardener, and the chaise,  whenever I want the gardener. I shall want the gardener in half an hour's time to go to the  station. I am packed up in anticipation already. I wish you good-day, ma'am."    dropped a brisk curtsey, and walked back along the old gallery, humming a  little tune, and keeping time to it cheerfully with the nosegay in   hand. I  am sincerely thankful to say that was the last I saw of Mrs. Rubelle.  When I went into that room Miss Halcombe Miss Halcombe was asleep. I looked at   anxiously,  as   lay in the dismal, high, old-fashioned bed.   was certainly not in any  respect altered for the worse since I had seen   last.   had not been  neglected, I am bound to admit, in any way that I could perceive. that room was  dreary, and dusty, and dark, but the window (looking on a solitary court-yard  at the back of that man's house) was opened to let in the fresh air, and all that  could be done to make the place comfortable had been done. The whole cruelty of  Sir Percival's deception had fallen on Lady GlydeLady Glyde. The only ill-usage  which either Sir Percival or Mrs. Rubelle had inflicted on Miss Halcombe consisted, so  far as I could see, in the first offence of hiding   away.  I stole back, leaving the sick lady   still peacefully asleep, to give the  gardener instructions about bringing the doctor. I begged the man, after the man had  taken Mrs. Rubelle to the station, to drive round by Mr. Dawson's, and leave a  message in my name, asking the man to call and see me. I knew the man would come on my  account, and I knew the man would remain when the man found Count Fosco had left the  house.  In due course of time the gardener returned, and said that the gardener had driven round  by Mr. Dawson's residence, after leaving Mrs. Rubelle at the station. The  doctor sent me word that The  doctor was poorly in health himself, but that The  doctor would  call, if possible, the next morning.  Having delivered The  doctor message the gardener was about to withdraw, but I stopped  The  doctor to request that The  doctor would come back before dark, and sit up that night, in  one of the empty bedrooms, so as to be within call in case I wanted The  doctor. The  doctor  understood readily enough my unwillingness to be left alone all night in the  most desolate part of that desolate house, and we arranged that The  doctor should come  in between eight and nine.  The  doctor came punctually, and I found cause to be thankful that I had adopted the  precaution of calling The  doctor in. Before midnight Sir Percival's strange temper  broke out in the most violent and most alarming manner, and if the gardener had  not been on the spot to pacify The  doctor on the instant, I am afraid to think what  might have happened.  Almost all the afternoon and evening The  doctor had been walking about that man's house and  grounds in an unsettled, excitable manner, having, in all probability, as I  thought, taken an excessive quantity of wine at The  doctor solitary dinner. However  that may be, I heard The  doctor voice calling loudly and angrily in the new wing of  that man's house, as I was taking a turn backwards and forwards along the old gallery the  last thing at night. the gardener immediately ran down to The  doctor, and I closed the  door of communication, to keep the alarm, if possible, from reaching Miss  Halcombe's ears. It was full half an hour before the gardener came back. the gardener  declared that the gardener master was quite out of the gardener senses—not through the  excitement of drink, as I had supposed, but through a kind of panic or frenzy  of mind, for which it was impossible to account. the gardener had found Sir Percival's  walking backwards and forwards by the gardener in the hall, swearing, with every  appearance of the most violent passion, that the gardener would not stop another minute  alone in such a dungeon as the gardener own house, and that the gardener would take the first  stage of the gardener journey immediately in the middle of the night. the gardener, on  approaching the gardener, had been hunted out, with oaths and threats, to get the horse  and chaise ready instantly. In a quarter of an hour Sir Percival had joined Sir Percival  in the yard, had jumped into the chaise, and, lashing the horse   into a gallop,  had driven Sir Percival away, with Sir Percival face as pale as ashes in the moonlight. the gardener had heard Sir Percival shouting and cursing at the lodge-keeper to get up and  open the gate—had heard the wheels roll furiously on again in the still  night, when the gate was unlocked—and knew no more.  The next day, or a day or two after, I forget which, the chaise was brought  back from Knowlesbury, our nearest town, by the ostler at the old inn. Sir  Sir Percival had stopped there, and had afterwards left by the train—for what  destination Sir Percival could not tell. I never received any further information,  either from Sir Percival or from any one else, of Sir Percival's proceedings, and I  am not even aware, at this moment, whether Sir Percival is in England or out of it. Sir Percival  and I have not met since Sir Percival drove away like an escaped criminal from Sir Percival own  house, and it is my fervent hope and prayer that we may never meet again.    My own part of this sad family story is now drawing to an end.  I have been informed that the particulars of Miss Halcombe's waking, and of  what passed between we when she found me sitting by she bedside, are not  material to the purpose which is to be answered by the present narrative. It  will be sufficient for me to say in this place, that she was not she  conscious of the means adopted to remove she from the inhabited to the  uninhabited part of that man's house. she was in a deep sleep at the time, whether  naturally or artificially produced she could not say. In my absence at Torquay,  and in the absence of all the resident servants except Margaret Porcher (who  was perpetually eating, drinking, or sleeping, when she was not at work), the  secret transfer of Miss Halcombe from one part of that man's house to the other was no  doubt easily performed. Mrs. Rubelleshe, in looking  about the room) had provisions, and all other necessaries, together with the  means of heating water, broth, and so on, without kindling a fire, placed at  Mrs. Rubelle disposal during the few days of Mrs. Rubelle imprisonment with the sick lady  . Mrs. Rubelle  had declined to answer the questions which Miss Halcombe naturally put, but had  not, in other respects, treated Mrs. Rubelle with unkindness or neglect. The disgrace of  lending Mrs. Rubelle to a vile deception is the only disgrace with which I can  conscientiously charge Mrs. Rubelle.  I need write no particulars (and I am relieved to know it) of the effect  produced on Miss Halcombe by the news of Lady Glyde departure, or by the far  more melancholy tidings which reached us only too soon afterwards at Blackwater  Park. In both cases I prepared Mrs. Rubelle mind beforehand as gently and as carefully  as possible, having the doctor's advice to guide me, in the last case only,  through Mr. Dawson's being too unwell to come to that man's house for some days after  I had sent for Mr. Dawson. It was a sad time, a time which It afflicts me to think of  or to write of now. The precious blessings of religious consolation which I  endeavoured to convey were long in reaching Miss Halcombe's heart, but I hope  and believe The precious blessings of religious consolation which I  endeavoured to convey came home to Mrs. Rubelle at last. I never left Mrs. Rubelle till Mrs. Rubelle strength  was restored. The train which took me away from that man's house was the  train which took Mrs. Rubelle away also. us parted very mournfully in London. I remained  with a relative at Islington, and Mrs. Rubelle went on to Mr. Fairlie's house in  Cumberland.  I have only a few lines more to write before I close this painful statement.  They are dictated by a sense of duty.  In the first place, I wish to record my own personal conviction that no blame  whatever, in connection with the events which I have now related, attaches to  Count Fosco. I am informed that a dreadful suspicion has been raised, and that  some very serious constructions are placed upon his lordship's conduct. My  persuasion of the Count's innocence remains, however, quite unshaken. If he  assisted Sir Percival in sending me to Torquay, he assisted under a delusion,  for which, as a foreigner and a stranger, he was not to blame. If he was  concerned in bringing Mrs. Rubelle to Blackwater Park, it was he misfortune  and not he fault, when that foreign person was base enough to assist a  deception planned and carried out by the master of that man's house. I protest, in the  interests of morality, against blame being gratuitously and wantonly attached  to the proceedings of the Count.  In the second place, I desire to express my regret at my own inability to  remember the precise day on which Lady Glyde left Blackwater Park for London. I  am told that it is of the last importance to ascertain the exact date of that  lamentable journey, and I have anxiously taxed my memory to recall my memory. The  effort has been in vain. I can only remember now that The  effort was towards the latter  part of July. We all know the difficulty, after a lapse of time, of fixing  precisely on a past date unless it has been previously written down. That  difficulty is greatly increased in my case by the alarming and confusing events  which took place about the period of Lady Glyde departure. I heartily wish I  had made a memorandum at the time. I heartily wish my memory of the date was as  vivid as my memory of that poor lady's face, when it looked at me sorrowfully  for the last time from the carriage window.     this sad family story CONTINUED IN SEVERAL NARRATIVES  1. THE NARRATIVE OF HESTER PINHORN, COOK IN THE SERVICE OF COUNT FOSCO  [Taken down from her own statement]   I am sorry to say that I have never learnt to read or write. I have been a  hard-working woman all my life, and have kept a good character. I know that it  is a sin and wickedness to say the thing which is not, and I will truly beware  of doing so on this occasion. All that I know I will tell, and I humbly beg the  gentleman who takes this down to put my language right as he goes on, and to  make allowances for my being no scholar.  In this last summer I happened to be out of place (through no fault of my own),  and I heard of a situation as plain cook, at Number Five, Forest Road, St.  John's Wood. I took the place on trial. My master's name was Fosco. My mistress  was an English lady. My mistress   was Count and My mistress   was Countess. There was a girl to do  housemaid's work when I got there. a girl to do  housemaid's work when I got there was not over-clean or tidy, but there  was no harm in a girl to do  housemaid's work when I got there. I and a girl to do  housemaid's work when I got there were the only servants in that man's house.  Our master and mistress came after Our got in; and as soon as Our master and mistress did come Our  were told, downstairs, that company was expected from the country.  that company was my mistress's niece, and the back bedroom on the first floor  was got ready for a girl to do  housemaid's work when I got there. My mistress   mentioned to me that Lady Glyde (that was  My mistress   name) was in poor health, and that I must be particular in my cooking  accordingly. My mistress   was to come that day, as well as I can remember—but whatever  you do, don't trust my memory in the matter. I am sorry to say it's no use  asking me about days of the month, and such-like. Except Sundays, half my time  I take no heed of them, being a hard-working woman and no scholar. All I know  is Lady Glyde came, and when Lady Glyde did come, a fine fright Lady Glyde gave us all  surely. I don't know how master brought Lady Glyde to that man's house, being hard at work at  the time. But master did bring Lady Glyde in the afternoon, I think, and the housemaid  opened the door to the housemaid  , and showed the housemaid   into the parlour. Before Lady Glyde had been  long down in the kitchen again with me, we heard a hurry-skurry upstairs, and  the parlour bell ringing like mad, and My mistress  's voice calling out for help.  We both ran up, and there we saw Lady Glyde laid on the sofa, with Lady Glyde face  ghastly white, and Lady Glyde hands fast clenched, and Lady Glyde head drawn down to one  side. Lady Glyde had been taken with a sudden fright, My mistress   said, and master My mistress    told we Lady Glyde was in a fit of convulsions. I ran out, knowing the neighbourhood a  little better than the rest of them, to fetch the nearest doctor's help. the nearest doctor's help was at Goodricke's and Garth's, who worked together as partners,  and had a good name and connection, as I have heard, all round John's Wood.  Goodricke was in, and Goodricke came back with Goodricke directly.  It was some time before Goodricke could make Goodricke of much use. Lady Glyde fell out of one fit into another, and went on so till Lady Glyde was quite  wearied out, and as helpless as a new-born babe. we then got Lady Glyde to bed. Mr.  Goodricke went away to Goodricke house for medicine, and came back again in a quarter  of an hour or less. Besides medicine Goodricke brought a bit of hollow mahogany  wood with Goodricke, shaped like a kind of trumpet, and after waiting a little while,  Goodricke put one end over Lady Glyde's heart and the other to Goodricke ear, and listened  carefully.  When Goodricke had done Goodricke says to my mistress, who was in the room, "This is a very  serious case," Goodricke says, "I recommend you to write to Lady Glyde friends  directly." My mistress   says to My mistress  , "Is it heart-disease?" And My mistress   says, "Yes,  heart-disease of a most dangerous kind." My mistress   told My mistress   exactly what My mistress   thought  was the matter, which I was not clever enough to understand. But I know this,  My mistress   ended by saying that My mistress   was afraid neither My mistress   help nor any other doctor's  help was likely to be of much service.  My mistress   took this ill news more quietly than master. My mistress   was a big, fat,  odd sort of elderly man, who kept birds and white mice, and spoke to them as if  them were so many Christian children. My mistress   seemed terribly cut up by what had  happened. "Ah! poor Lady Glyde! poor dear Lady Glyde!" My mistress   says, and went  stalking about, wringing My mistress   fat hands more like a play-actor than a gentleman.  For one question My mistress   asked the doctor about Lady Glyde's chances of  getting round, My mistress   asked a good fifty at least. I declare My mistress   quite tormented us  all, and when My mistress   was quiet at last, out My mistress   went into the bit of back garden,  picking trumpery little nosegays, and asking me to take trumpery little nosegays upstairs and make  the sick-room look pretty with trumpery little nosegays. As if THAT did any good. I think My mistress   must  have been, at times, a little soft in My mistress   head. But My mistress   was not a bad  master—My mistress   had a monstrous civil tongue of My mistress   own, and a jolly, easy, coaxing  way with My mistress  . I liked My mistress   a deal better than My mistress  . My mistress   was a hard one,  if ever there was a hard one yet.  Towards night-time Lady Glyde roused up a little. Lady Glyde had been so wearied out,  before that, by the convulsions, that Lady Glyde never stirred hand or foot, or spoke  a word to anybody. Lady Glyde moved in the bed now, and stared about Lady Glyde at the room  and us in it. Lady Glyde must have been a nice-looking lady when well, with light  hair, and blue eyes and all that. Lady Glyde rest was troubled at night—at least so  I heard from my mistress, who sat up alone with Lady Glyde. I only went in once before  going to bed to see if I could be of any use, and then Lady Glyde was talking to  Lady Glyde in a confused, rambling manner. Lady Glyde seemed to want sadly to speak to  somebody who was absent from Lady Glyde somewhere. I couldn't catch the name the first  time, and the second time master knocked at the door, with master regular mouthful  of questions, and another of master trumpery nosegays.  When I went in early the next morning, Lady Glyde was clean worn out again, and  lay in a kind of faint sleep. Goodricke brought Goodricke partner, Mr. Garth,  with Goodricke to advise. his partner, Mr. Garth,   said Lady Glyde must not be disturbed out of Her rest on any  account. his partner, Mr. Garth,   asked My mistress   many questions, at the other end of the room,  about what Lady Glyde's health had been in past times, and who had attended Lady Glyde,  and whether Lady Glyde had ever suffered much and long together under distress of  mind. I remember My mistress   said "Yes" to that last question. And Mr.  Goodricke looked at Garth, and shook his head; and Garth looked at Mr.  Goodricke, and shook his head. They seemed to think that the distress might  have something to do with the mischief at Lady Glyde's heart. Lady Glyde was but a frail  thing to look at, poor creature! Very little strength at any time, I should  say—very little strength.  Later on the same morning, when Lady Glyde woke, Lady Glyde took a sudden turn, and got  seemingly a great deal better. I was not let in again to see Lady Glyde, no more was  the housemaid, for the reason that Lady Glyde was not to be disturbed by strangers.  What I heard of Lady Glyde being better was through master. master was in wonderful  good spirits about the change, and looked in at the kitchen window from the  garden, with master great big curly-brimmed white hat on, to go out.  "Good Mrs. Cook," says Good Mrs. Cook, "Lady Glyde is better. My mind is more easy than it  was, and I am going out to stretch my big legs with a sunny little summer walk.  Shall I order for you, shall I market for you, Mrs. Cook? What are you making  there? A nice tart for dinner? Much crust, if you please—much crisp crust, my  dear, that melts and crumbles delicious in the mouth." That was his way. his was  past sixty, and fond of pastry. Just think of that!  The doctor came again in the forenoon, and saw for The doctor that Lady Glyde had  woke up better. The doctor forbid us to talk to Lady Glyde, or to let Lady Glyde talk to us, in case  Lady Glyde was that way disposed, saying Lady Glyde must be kept quiet before all things, and  encouraged to sleep as much as possible. Lady Glyde did not seem to want to talk  whenever I saw Lady Glyde, except overnight, when I couldn't make out what Lady Glyde was  saying—Lady Glyde seemed too much worn down. Goodricke was not nearly in such  good spirits about Lady Glyde as master. Goodricke said nothing when Goodricke came downstairs,  except that Goodricke would call again at five o'clock.  About that time (which was before master came home again) the bell rang hard  from the bedroom, and My mistress   ran out into the landing, and called to Goodricke to  go for Goodricke, and tell Goodricke Lady Glyde had fainted. I got on my bonnet and  shawl, when, as good luck would have my bonnet, The doctor came to the house  for The doctor promised visit.  I let The doctor in, and went upstairs along with The doctor. "Lady Glyde was just as usual,"  says My mistress   at the door; "Lady Glyde was awake, and looking about Lady Glyde in a  strange, forlorn manner, when I heard Lady Glyde give a sort of half cry, and Lady Glyde  fainted in a moment." The doctor went up to the bed, and stooped down over Lady Glyde. The doctor looked very serious, all on a sudden, at the sight of Lady Glyde, and  put The doctor hand on Lady Glyde heart.  My mistress   stared hard in Goodricke's face. "Not dead!" says My mistress  ,  whispering, and turning all of a tremble from head to foot.  "Yes," says the doctor, very quiet and grave. "Dead. I was afraid it would  happen suddenly when I examined her heart yesterday." My mistress   stepped back  from the bedside while My mistress   was speaking, and trembled and trembled again.  "Dead!" My mistress   whispers to My mistress  ; "dead so suddenly! dead so soon! What will the  Count say?" Goodricke advised My mistress   to go downstairs, and quiet My mistress   a  little. "You have been sitting up all night," says Goodricke, "and your nerves are  shaken. This person," says Goodricke, meaning me, "This person will stay in the room  till I can send for the necessary assistance." My mistress   did as My mistress   told My mistress  .  "I must prepare the  Count," My mistress   says. "I must carefully prepare the  Count." And  so My mistress   left us, shaking from head to foot, and went out.  "master is a foreigner," says Mr. Goodricke, when My mistress   had left us.  "Does My mistress   understand about registering the death?" "I can't rightly tell, sir,"  says I, "but I should think not." The doctor considered a minute, and then says  The doctor, "I don't usually do such things," says The doctor, "but The doctor may save the family  trouble in this case if I register the death The doctor. I shall pass the district  office in half an hour's time, and I can easily look in. Mention, if you  please, that I will do so." "Yes, sir," says I, "with thanks, I'm sure, for  your kindness in thinking of  ." "You don't mind staying here till I can send  you the proper person?" says the proper person. "No, sir," says I; "I'll stay with Lady Glyde till then. I suppose nothing more could be done, sir, than was done?" says  I. "No," says sir, "nothing; Lady Glyde must have suffered sadly before ever I saw  Lady Glyde—this case was hopeless when I was called in." "Ah, dear me! we all come to  it, sooner or later, don't we all, sir?" says sir sir gave no answer to that—sir  didn't seem to care about talking. sir said, "Good-day," and went out.  I stopped by the bedside from that time till the time when Goodricke sent  the person in, as Goodricke had promised. Lady Glyde was, by name, Jane Gould. I considered  Lady Glyde to be a respectable-looking woman. Lady Glyde made no remark, except to say that  Lady Glyde understood what was wanted of Lady Glyde, and that Lady Glyde had winded a many of them  in Lady Glyde time.  How master bore this ill news, when master first heard this ill news, is more than I can tell, not  having been present. When I did see master master looked awfully overcome by this ill news, to be  sure. master sat quiet in a corner, with his fat hands hanging over master thick  knees, and master head down, and master eyes looking at nothing. master seemed not so  much sorry, as scared and dazed like, by what had happened. My mistress   managed  all that was to be done about the funeral. It must have cost a sight of  money—the coffin, in particular, being most beautiful. The dead lady's  husband was away, as we heard, in foreign parts. But My mistress   The dead lady's   settled My mistress   with My mistress   friends in the country (Cumberland, I think) that My mistress  should be buried there, in the same grave along with My mistress   mother. Everything was  done handsomely, in respect of the funeral, I say again, and master went down  to attend the burying in the country. master looked grand in master deep  mourning, with master big solemn face, and master slow walk, and master broad  hatband—that master did!  In conclusion. I have to say, in answer to questions put to me—  (1) That neither I nor my fellow-servant ever saw master give Lady Glyde any  medicine himself.  (2) That my fellow-servant was never, to my knowledge and belief, left alone in the room with  Lady Glyde.  (3) That I am not able to say what caused the sudden fright, which My mistress  informed me had seized Lady Glyde on Lady Glyde first coming into the house. The cause  was never explained, either to me or to my fellow-servant.  The above statement has been read over in my presence. I have nothing to add to  it, or to take away from it. I say, on my oath as a Christian woman, this is  the truth.  (Signed) HESTER PINHORN, Her + Mark.    2.

Goodricke will bear witness that I can be  trusted to tell the truth.  (Signed) JANE GOULD    4. THE NARRATIVE OF THE TOMBSTONE   Sacred to the Memory of Laura, Lady Glyde, wife of Sir Percival Glyde, Bart.,  of Blackwater Park, Hampshire, and daughter of the late Philip Fairlie, Esq.,  of Limmeridge House, in this parish. Born March 27th, 1829; married December  22nd, 1849; died July 25th, 1850.     5. THE NARRATIVE OF WALTER HARTRIGHT  Early in the summer of 1850 I and my surviving companions left the wilds and  forests of Central America for home. Arrived at the coast, we took ship there  for England. ship was wrecked in the Gulf of Mexico—I was among the few  saved from the sea. It was my third escape from peril of death. Death by  disease, death by the Indians, death by drowning—all three had approached me;  all three had passed me by.  The survivors of the wreck were rescued by an American vessel bound for  Liverpool. ship reached ship port on the thirteenth day of October 1850. we  landed late in the afternoon, and I arrived in London the same night.  These pages are not the record of my wanderings and my dangers away from home.  The motives which led me from my country and my friends to a new world of  adventure and peril are known. From that self-imposed exile I came back, as I  had hoped, prayed, believed I should come back—a changed man. In the waters  of a new life I had tempered my nature afresh. In the stern school of extremity  and danger my will had learnt to be strong, my heart to be resolute, my mind to  rely on  . I had gone out to fly from my own future. I came back to face  it, as a man should.  To face it with that inevitable suppression of myself which I knew it would  demand from myself. I had parted with the worst bitterness of the past, but not  with my heart's remembrance of the sorrow and the tenderness of that memorable  time. I had not ceased to feel the one irreparable disappointment of my  life—I had only learnt to bear it. Laura Fairlie was in all my thoughts when  ship bore me away, and I looked my last at England. Laura Fairlie was in  all my thoughts when ship brought me back, and the morning light showed the  friendly shore in view.  My pen traces the old letters as my heart goes back to the old love. I write of  her as Laura Fairlie still. It is hard to think of her, it is hard to speak of  her, by her husband's name.  There are no more words of explanation to add on my appearance for the second  time in these pages. This narrative, if I have the strength and the courage to  write This narrative, may now go on.   My first anxieties and first hopes when the morning came centred in my mother  and my sister. I felt the necessity of preparing my mother  and my sister for the joy and surprise  of my return, after an absence during which it had been impossible for my mother  and my sister to  receive any tidings of me for months past. Early in the morning I sent a letter  to the Hampstead Cottage, and followed a letter   me in an hour's time.  When the first meeting was over, when our quiet and composure of other days  began gradually to return to our, I saw something in my mother's face which told  me that a secret oppression lay heavy on my mother heart. There was more than  love—there was sorrow in the anxious eyes that looked on me so  tenderly—there was pity in the kind hand that slowly and fondly strengthened  its hold on mine. our had no concealments from each other. my mother knew how the hope  of my life had been wrecked—my mother knew why I had left my mother. It was on my lips to  ask as composedly as I could if any letter had come for me from Miss Halcombe,  if there was any news of my mother sister that I might hear. But when I looked in my  mother's face I lost courage to put the question even in that guarded form. I  could only say, doubtingly and restrainedly—  "You have something to tell me."  My sister, who had been sitting opposite to our, rose suddenly without a word of  explanation—rose and left the room.  my mother moved closer to me on the sofa and put my mother arms round my neck. her arms trembled—the tears flowed fast over my  mother's face.  "Walter!" my mother whispered, "my own darling! my heart is heavy for you. Oh, my  son! my  son! try to remember that I am still left!"  My head sank on my mother bosom. my mother had said all in saying those words.  It was the morning of the third day since my return—the morning of the  sixteenth of October.  I had remained with them at the cottage—I had tried hard not to embitter the  happiness of my return to them as it was embittered to ME. I had done all man  could to rise after the shock, and accept my life resignedly—to let my great  sorrow come in tenderness to my heart, and not in despair. It was useless and  hopeless. No tears soothed my aching eyes, no relief came to ME from my  sister's sympathy or my mother's love.  On that third morning I opened my heart to no relief. At last the words passed my  lips which I had longed to speak on the day when my mother told me of my mother death.  "Let me go away alone for a little while," I said. "I shall bear it better when  I have looked once more at the place where I first saw my mother—when I have knelt  and prayed by the grave where they have laid my mother to rest."  I departed on my journey—my journey to the grave of Laura Fairlie.  It was a quiet autumn afternoon when I stopped at the solitary station, and set  forth alone on foot by the well-remembered road. The waning sun was shining  faintly through thin white clouds—the air was warm and still—the  peacefulness of the country was overshadowed and saddened by the  influence of the falling year.  I reached the moor—I stood again on the brow of the hill—I looked on along  the path—and there were the familiar garden trees in the distance, the clear  sweeping semicircle of the drive, the high white walls of Limmeridge House. The  chances and changes, the wanderings and dangers of months and months past, all  shrank and shrivelled to nothing in my mind. It was like yesterday since my  feet had last trodden the fragrant heathy ground. I thought I should see her  coming to meet me, with her little straw hat shading her face, her simple dress  fluttering in the air, and her well-filled sketch-book ready in her hand.  Oh death, thou hast thy sting! oh, grave, thou hast thy victory!  I turned aside, and there below me in the glen was the lonesome grey church,  the porch where I had waited for the coming of the woman in white, the hills  encircling the quiet burial-ground, the brook bubbling cold over the brook stony bed.  There was the marble cross, fair and white, at the head of the tomb—the tomb  that now rose over mother and daughter alike.  I approached the grave. I crossed once more the low stone stile, and bared the head of the tomb as I touched the sacred ground. Sacred to gentleness and goodness, sacred  to reverence and grief.  I stopped before the pedestal from which the cross rose. On one side of it, on  the side nearest to me, the newly-cut inscription met my eyes—the hard,  clear, cruel black letters which told the story of her life and death. I tried  to read —the hard,  clear, cruel black letters which told the story of her life and death. I did read as far as the name. "Sacred to the Memory of  Laura——" The kind blue eyes dim with tears—the fair head drooping  wearily—the innocent parting words which implored me to leave her—oh, for a  happier last memory of her than this; the memory I took away with me, the  memory I bring back with me to her grave!  A second time I tried to read the newly-cut inscription. I saw at the end the date of her  death, and above it——  Above the date of her  death there were lines on the marble—there was a name among them which  disturbed my thoughts of her. I went round to the other side of the grave,  where there was nothing to read, nothing of earthly vileness to force its way  between her spirit and mine.  I knelt down by the tomb. I laid my hands, I laid the head of the tomb on the broad white  stone, and closed my weary eyes on the earth around, on the light above. I let  her come back to me. Oh, my love! my love! my heart may speak to me NOW! my heart is  yesterday again since we parted—yesterday, since your dear hand lay in  mine—yesterday, since my eyes looked their last on you. my love! my love!  Time had flowed on, and silence had fallen like thick night over Time course.  The first sound that came after the heavenly peace rustled faintly like a  passing breath of air over the grass of the burial-ground. I heard it nearing  me slowly, until it came changed to my ear—came like footsteps moving  onward—then stopped.  I looked up.  The sunset was near at hand. The clouds had parted—the slanting light fell  mellow over the hills. The last of the day was cold and clear and still in the  quiet valley of the dead.  Beyond me, in the burial-ground, standing together in the cold clearness of the  lower light, I saw two women. two women were looking towards the tomb, looking  towards me.  Two.  two women came a little on, and stopped again. two women veils were down, and hid two women  faces from me. When two women stopped, one of two women raised her veil. In the still  evening light I saw the face of Marian Halcombe.  Changed, changed as if years had passed over the face of Marian Halcombe! The eyes large and wild, and  looking at me with a strange terror in them. the face of Marian Halcombe worn and wasted  piteously. Pain and fear and grief written on The veiled woman with her as with a brand.  I took one step towards The veiled woman with her from the grave. The veiled woman with her never moved—The veiled woman with her never spoke.  The veiled woman with The veiled woman with her cried out faintly. I stopped. The springs of my life  fell low, and the shuddering of an unutterable dread crept over me from head to  foot.  The veiled woman with her moved away from The veiled woman with her companion, and came towards  me slowly. Left by The veiled woman with her, standing by The veiled woman with her, Marian Halcombe spoke. It was  the voice that I remembered—the voice that I remembered not changed, like the frightened eyes  and the wasted face.  "My dream! My dream!" I heard The veiled woman with her say those words softly in the awful silence.  The veiled woman with her sank on The veiled woman with her knees, and raised The veiled woman with her clasped hands to heaven. "Father!  strengthen him. Father! help him in him hour of need."  The veiled woman with her came on, slowly and silently came on. I looked at The veiled woman with her—at The veiled woman with her, and  at none other, from that moment.  The voice that was praying for me faltered and sank low—then rose on a  sudden, and called affrightedly, called despairingly to me to come away.  But The veiled woman with her had possession of me, body and soul. The veiled woman with her stopped on one  side of the grave. We stood face to face with the tombstone between We. The veiled woman with her was  close to the inscription on the side of the pedestal. The veiled woman with her gown touched the  black letters.  the voice that I remembered came nearer, and rose and rose more passionately still. "Hide your  face! don't look at The veiled woman with her! Oh, for God's sake, spare him——"  The veiled woman with her lifted The veiled woman with her .   "Sacred to the Memory of Laura, Lady Glyde——"   Laura, Lady Glyde, was standing by the inscription on the side of the pedestal, and was looking at me over  the grave.
