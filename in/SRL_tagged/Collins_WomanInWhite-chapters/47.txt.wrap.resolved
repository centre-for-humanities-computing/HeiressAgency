 MY first conviction as soon as I found myself outside the house, was that no  alternative was left me but to act at once on the information I had  received—to make sure of the Count that night, or to risk the loss, if I only  delayed till the morning, of Laura's last chance. I looked at my watch—it was  ten o'clock.  Not the shadow of a doubt crossed my mind of the purpose for which the Count  had left the theatre. the Count   escape from us, that evening, was beyond all question  the preliminary only to the Count   escape from London. The mark of the Brotherhood was  on The mark of the Brotherhood arm—I felt as certain of it as if The mark of the Brotherhood had shown me the brand; and the  betrayal of the Brotherhood was on The mark of the Brotherhood conscience—I had seen it in The mark of the Brotherhood  recognition of Pesca.  It was easy to understand why that recognition had not been mutual. A man of  the Count's character would never risk the terrible consequences of turning spy  without looking to spy   personal security quite as carefully as spy   looked to spy    golden reward. The shaven face, which I had pointed out at the Opera, might  have been covered by a beard in Pesca's time—his dark brown hair might be a  wig—his name was evidently a false one. The accident of time might have  helped his as well—his immense corpulence might have come with his later  years. There was every reason why Pesca should not have known his again—every  reason also why his should have known Pesca, whose singular personal appearance  made a marked man of his, go where his might.  I have said that I felt certain of the purpose in the Count's mind when his  escaped us at the theatre. How could I doubt it, when I saw, with my own eyes,  that his believed his, in spite of the change in his appearance, to have  been recognised by Pesca, and to be therefore in danger of his life? If I could  get speech of his that night, if I could show his that I, too knew of the  mortal peril in which his stood, what result would follow? Plainly this. One of  us must be master of the situation—one of us must inevitably be at the mercy  of the other.  I owed it to myself to consider the chances against myself before I confronted  them. I owed it to my wife to do all that lay in my power to lessen the risk.  the chances against me wanted no reckoning up—them were all merged in one. If  the Count discovered, by my own avowal, that the direct way to the Count safety lay  through my life, the Count was probably the last man in existence who would shrink  from throwing me off my guard and taking that way, when the Count had me alone within  the Count reach. The only means of defence against the Count on which I could at all rely  to lessen the risk, presented The only means of defence against him on which I could at all rely  to lessen the risk, after a little careful thinking,  clearly enough. Before I made any personal acknowledgment of my discovery in  his presence, I must place the discovery itself where it would be ready for  instant use against the Count, and safe from any attempt at suppression on the Count part.  If I laid the mine under the Count feet before I approached the Count, and if I left  instructions with a third person to fire the mine on the expiration of a certain  time, unless directions to the contrary were previously received under my own  hand, or from my own lips—in that event the Count's security was absolutely  dependent upon mine, and I might hold the vantage ground over the Count securely,  even in the Count own house.  This idea occurred to me when I was close to the new lodgings which we had  taken on returning from the sea-side. I went in without disturbing any one, by  the help of my key. A light was in the hall, and I stole up with A light to my  workroom to make my preparations, and absolutely to commit me to an  interview with the Count, before either Laura or Marian could have the  slightest suspicion of what I intended to do.  A letter addressed to Pesca represented the surest measure of precaution which  it was now possible for me to take. I wrote as follows—  "The man whom I pointed out to you at the Opera is a member of the Brotherhood,  and has been false to The man whom I pointed out to you at the Opera trust. Put both these assertions to the test  instantly. You know the name he goes by in England. he address is No. 5 Forest  Road, St. John's Wood. On the love you once bore me, use the power entrusted to  you without mercy and without delay against that man. I have risked all and  lost all—and the forfeit of my failure has been paid with my life."  I signed and dated these lines, enclosed these lines in an envelope, and sealed an envelope up.  On the outside I wrote this direction: "Keep the enclosure unopened until nine  o'clock to-morrow morning. If you do not hear from me, or see me, before that  time, break the seal when the clock strikes, and read the contents." I added my  initials, and protected the whole by enclosing the whole in a second sealed envelope,  addressed to Pesca at Pesca lodgings.  Nothing remained to be done after this but to find the means of sending my  letter to my  letter destination immediately. I should then have accomplished all that  lay in my power. If anything happened to me in the Count's house, I had now  provided for his answering anything happened to me in the Count's house with his life.  That the means of preventing his escape, under any circumstances whatever, were  at Pesca's disposal, if his chose to exert the means of preventing his escape, under any circumstances whatever, were  at Pesca's disposal, I did not for an instant doubt.  The extraordinary anxiety which his had expressed to remain unenlightened as to  the Count's identity—or, in other words, to be left uncertain enough about  facts to justify his to his own conscience in remaining passive—betrayed  plainly that the means of exercising the terrible justice of the Brotherhood  were ready to his hand, although, as a naturally humane man, his had shrunk from  plainly saying as much in my presence. The deadly certainty with which the  vengeance of foreign political societies can hunt down a traitor to the cause,  hide himself where himself may, had been too often exemplified, even in my  superficial experience, to allow of any doubt. Considering the subject only as  a reader of newspapers, cases recurred to my memory, both in London and in  Paris, of foreigners found stabbed in the streets, whose assassins could never  be traced—of bodies and parts of bodies thrown into the Thames and the Seine,  by hands that could never be discovered—of deaths by secret violence which  could only be accounted for in one way. I have disguised nothing relating to  myself in these pages, and I do not disguise here that I believed I had written  Count Fosco's death-warrant, if the fatal emergency happened which authorised  Pesca to open my enclosure.  I left my room to go down to the ground floor of the house, and speak to the  landlord about finding me a messenger. the  landlord about finding me a messenger happened to be ascending the stairs  at the time, and we met on the landing. the  landlord about finding me a messenger son, a quick lad, was the messenger  the  landlord about finding me a messenger proposed to myself on hearing what I wanted. we had the  landlord about finding me a messenger upstairs, and I gave  the  landlord about finding me a messenger the  landlord about finding me a messenger directions. the  landlord about finding me a messenger was to take the letter in a cab, to put the letter into  Professor Pesca's own hands, and to bring me back a line of acknowledgment from  that gentleman—returning in a cab, and keeping that gentleman at the door for my use.  that gentleman was then nearly half-past ten. I calculated that the  landlord about finding me a messenger might be back in  twenty minutes, and that I might drive to St. John's Wood, on the  landlord about finding me a messenger return, in  twenty minutes more.  When the lad had departed on the  landlord about finding me a messenger errand I returned to my own room for a little  while, to put certain papers in order, so that they might be easily found in  case of the worst. The key of the old-fashioned bureau in which the papers were  kept I sealed up, and left The key of the old-fashioned bureau in which the papers were  kept on my table, with Marian's name written on the  outside of the little packet. This done, I went downstairs to the sitting-room,  in which I expected to find Laura and Marian awaiting my return from the Opera.  I felt my hand trembling for the first time when I laid my hand on the lock of the  door.  No one was in my own room but Marian. No one was reading, and No one looked at No one  watch, in surprise, when I came in.  "How early you are back!" No one said. "You must have come away before the Operawas over."  "Yes," I replied, "neither Pesca nor I waited for the end. Where is Laura?"  "No one had one of No one bad headaches this evening, and I advised No one to go to bed  when we had done tea."  I left my own room again on the pretext of wishing to see whether Laura was  asleep. Marian's quick eyes were beginning to look inquiringly at my  faceMarian's quick instinct was beginning to discover that I had something  weighing on my mind.  When I entered the bedchamber, and softly approached the bedside by the dim  flicker of the night-lamp, my wife was asleep.  we had not been married quite a month yet. If my heart was heavy, if my  resolution for a moment faltered again, when I looked at my wife face turned  faithfully to my pillow in my wife sleep—when I saw my wife hand resting open on the  coverlid, as if her hand was waiting unconsciously for mine—surely there was some  excuse for me? I only allowed me a few minutes to kneel down at the  bedside, and to look close at my wife—so close that my wife breath, as it came and  went, fluttered on her face. I only touched my wife hand and my wife cheek with my lips  at parting. my wife stirred in her sleep and murmured my name, but without waking.  I lingered for an instant at the door to look at my wife again. "God bless and keep  you, my darling!" I whispered, and left my wife.  Marian was at the stairhead waiting for me. my wife had a folded slip of paper in  my wife hand.  "The landlord's son has brought this for you," my wife said. "The landlord's son has got a cab at  the door—The landlord's son says you ordered The landlord's son to keep this at your disposal."  "Quite right, Marian. I want the cab—I am going out again."  I descended the stairs as I spoke, and looked into the sitting-room to read the  slip of paper by the light on the table. the stairs contained these two sentences in  Pesca's handwriting—  "Your letter is received. If I don't see you before the time you mention, I  will break the seal when the clock strikes."  I placed the paper in my pocket-book, and made for the door. Marian met me on  the threshold, and pushed me back into the room, where the candle-light fell  full on her face. Marian held me by both hands, and Marian eyes fastened searchingly  on Marian.  "I see!" Marian said, in a low eager whisper. "You are trying the last chance  to-night."  "Yes, the last chance and the best," I whispered back.  "Not alone! Oh, Walter, for God's sake, not alone! Let me go with Walter. Don't  refuse me because I'm only a woman. I must go! I will go! I'll wait outside in  the cab!"  It was my turn now to hold HER. Marian tried to break away from me and get down  first to the door.  "If you want to help me," I said, "stop here and sleep in my wife's room  to-night. Only let me go away with my mind easy about Laura, and I answer for  everything else. Come, Marian, give me a kiss, and show that you have the  courage to wait till I come back."  I dared not allow HER time to say a word more. HER tried to hold me again. I  unclasped HER hands, and was out of the room in a moment. the  landlord about finding me a messenger below heard  me on the stairs, and opened the door. I jumped into the cab before the  driver could get off the box. "Forest Road, St. John's Wood," I called to the  landlord about finding me a messenger  through the front window. "Double fare if you get there in a quarter of an  hour." "I'll do it, sir." I looked at my watch. Eleven o'clock. Not a minute to  lose.  The rapid motion of the cab, the sense that every instant now was bringing me  nearer to the Count, the conviction that I was embarked at last, without let or  hindrance, on my hazardous enterprise, heated me into such a fever of  excitement that I shouted to the man to go faster and faster. As we left the  streets, and crossed St. John's Wood Road, my impatience so completely  overpowered me that I stood up in the cab and stretched my head out of the  window, to see the end of the journey before we reached it. Just as a church  clock in the distance struck the quarter past, we turned into the Forest Road.  I stopped the  driver a little away from the Count's house, paid and dismissed  the  driver, and walked on to the door.  As I approached the garden gate, I saw another person advancing towards the garden gate also  from the direction opposite to the  driver. we met under the gas lamp in the Forest Road, and  looked at each other. I instantly recognised the light-haired foreigner with  the scar on the man cheek, and I thought the man recognised me. the man said nothing, and  instead of stopping at the Count's house, as I did, the man slowly walked on. Was the man in the  Forest Road by accident? Or had the man followed the Count home from the Opera?  I did not pursue those questions. After waiting a little till the foreigner had  slowly passed out of sight, I rang the gate bell. It was then twenty minutes  past eleven—late enough to make it quite easy for the Count to get rid of me  by the excuse that the Count was in bed.  The only way of providing against this contingency was to send in my name  without asking any preliminary questions, and to let the Count know, at the same  time, that I had a serious motive for wishing to see the Count at that late hour.  Accordingly, while I was waiting, I took out my card and wrote under my name  "On important business." The maid-servant answered the door while I was writing  the last word in pencil, and asked me distrustfully what I "pleased to want."  "Be so good as to take that to your master," I replied, giving your master my card.  I saw, by your master's hesitation of manner, that if I had asked for the Count in  the first instance your master would only have followed your master instructions by telling me  he was not at home. your master was staggered by the confidence with which I gave your master  my card. After staring at me, in great perturbation, your master went back into the  house with my message, closing the door, and leaving me to wait in the garden.  In a minute or so your master reappeared. "your master master's compliments, and would I be so  obliging as to say what my business was?" "Take my compliments back," I  replied, "and say that my business cannot be mentioned to any one but your  master." your master left me again, again returned, and this time asked me to walk in.  I followed your master at once. In another moment I was inside the Count's house.
