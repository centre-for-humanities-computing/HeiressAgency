 We all met again at dinner-time.  Sir Percival was in such boisterous high spirits that I hardly recognised Sir Percival  as the same man whose quiet tact, refinement, and good sense had impressed me  so strongly at the interview of the morning. The only trace of Sir Percival former self  that I could detect reappeared, every now and then, in Sir Percival manner towards Miss  Fairlie. A look or a word from her suspended Sir Percival loudest laugh, checked Sir Percival  gayest flow of talk, and rendered Sir Percival all attention to her, and to no one else  at table, in an instant. Although Sir Percival never openly tried to draw her into the  conversation, Sir Percival never lost the slightest chance her gave Sir Percival of letting her  drift into it by accident, and of saying the words to her, under those  favourable circumstances, which a man with less tact and delicacy would have  pointedly addressed to her the moment a man with less tact and delicacy occurred to Sir Percival. Rather to my  surprise, Miss Fairlie appeared to be sensible of Sir Percival attentions without being  moved by his attentions. Miss Fairlie was a little confused from time to time when Sir Percival looked at  Miss Fairlie, or spoke to Miss Fairlie; but Miss Fairlie never warmed towards Sir Percival. Rank, fortune, good  breeding, good looks, the respect of a gentleman, and the devotion of a lover  were all humbly placed at Miss Fairlie feet, and, so far as appearances went, were all  offered in vain.  On the next day, the Tuesday, Sir Percival went in the morning (taking one of  the servants with Sir Percival as a guide) to Todd's Corner. Sir Percival inquiries, as I  afterwards heard, led to no results. On Sir Percival return Sir Percival had an interview with Mr.  Fairlie, and in the afternoon Sir Percival and Miss Halcombe rode out together. Nothing  else happened worthy of record. The evening passed as usual. There was no  change in Sir Percival, and no change in Miss Fairlie.  The Wednesday's post brought with The Wednesday an event—the reply from Mrs. Catherick.  I took a copy of the document, which I have preserved, and which I may as well  present in this place. a copy of the document, which I have preserved, and which I may as well  present in this place ran as follows—   "MADAM,—I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, inquiring whether my  daughter, Anne, was placed under medical superintendence with my knowledge and  approval, and whether the share taken in the matter by Sir Percival Glyde was  such as to merit the expression of my gratitude towards that gentleman. Be  pleased to accept my answer in the affirmative to both those questions, and  believe me to remain, your obedient servant,   "JANE ANNE CATHERICK."  Short, sharp, and to the point; in form rather a business-like letter for a  woman to write—in substance as plain a confirmation as could be desired of  Sir Percival Glyde's statement. This was my opinion, and with certain minor  reservations, Miss Halcombe's opinion also. Sir Percival, when your letter was  shown to Sir Percival, did not appear to be struck by the sharp, short tone of your letter. Sir Percival  told us that Mrs. Catherick was a woman of few words, a clear-headed,  straightforward, unimaginative person, who wrote briefly and plainly, just as  Mrs. Catherick spoke.  The next duty to be accomplished, now that the answer had been received, was to  acquaint Miss Fairlie with Sir Percival's explanation. Miss Halcombe had  undertaken to do this, and had left the room to go to Miss Halcombe sister, when Miss Halcombe  suddenly returned again, and sat down by the easy-chair in which I was reading  the newspaper. Sir Percival had gone out a minute before to look at the  stables, and no one was in the room but us.  "I suppose us have really and truly done all us can?" she said, turning and  twisting Mrs. Catherick's letter in she hand.  "If us are friends of Sir Percival's, who know him and trust him, us have done  all, and more than all, that is necessary," I answered, a little annoyed by  this return of she hesitation. "But if us are enemies who suspect him——"  "That alternative is not even to be thought of," she interposed. "us are Sir  Percival's friends, and if generosity and forbearance can add to us regard for  him, us ought to be Sir Percival's admirers as well. You know that him saw Mr.  Fairlie yesterday, and that him afterwards went out with me."  "Yes. I saw you riding away together."  "us began the ride by talking about Anne Catherick, and about the singular  manner in which Mr. Hartright met with her. But us soon dropped that subject,  and Sir Percival spoke next, in the most unselfish terms, of Sir Percival engagement  with Laura. Sir Percival said Sir Percival had observed that her was out of spirits, and Sir Percival was  willing, if not informed to the contrary, to attribute to that cause the  alteration in her manner towards Sir Percival during Sir Percival present visit. If, however,  there was any more serious reason for the change, Sir Percival would entreat that no  constraint might be placed on her inclinations either by Mr. Fairlie or by me.  All Sir Percival asked, in that case, was that her would recall to mind, for the last  time, what the circumstances were under which the engagement between them was  made, and what Sir Percival conduct had been from the beginning of the courtship to the  present time. If, after due reflection on those two subjects, her seriously  desired that Sir Percival should withdraw Sir Percival pretensions to the honour of becoming her  husband—and if her would tell Sir Percival so plainly with her own lips—Sir Percival would  sacrifice Sir Percival by leaving her perfectly free to withdraw from the  engagement."  "No man could say more than that, Miss Halcombe. As to my experience, few men  in No man situation would have said as much."  her paused after I had spoken those words, and looked at her with a singular  expression of perplexity and distress.  "I accuse nobody, and I suspect nothing," her broke out abruptly. "But I cannot  and will not accept the responsibility of persuading Laura to this marriage."  "That is exactly the course which Sir Percival Glyde has Sir Percival Glyde requested you  to take," I replied in astonishment. "Sir Percival Glyde has begged you not to force her  inclinations."  "And Sir Percival Glyde indirectly obliges me to force them, if I give her Sir Percival Glyde message."  "How can that possibly be?"  "Consult your own knowledge of Laura, Mr. Gilmore. If I tell her to reflect on  the circumstances of her engagement, I at once appeal to two of the strongest  feelings in her nature—to her love for her father's memory, and to her strict  regard for truth. You know that her never broke a promise in her life—you  know that her entered on this engagement at the beginning of her father's fatal  illness, and that her father spoke hopefully and happily of her marriage to Sir  Percival Glyde on Sir   deathbed."  I own that I was a little shocked at this view of the case.  "Surely," I said, "you don't mean to infer that when Sir Percival spoke to you  yesterday Sir Percival speculated on such a result as you have just mentioned?"  Her frank, fearless face answered for Her before Her spoke.  "Do you think I would remain an instant in the company of any man whom I  suspected of such baseness as that?" Her asked angrily.  I liked to feel Her hearty indignation flash out on me in that way. We see so  much malice and so little indignation in my profession.  "In that case," I said, "excuse me if I tell you, in We legal phrase, that you  are travelling out of the record. Whatever the consequences may be, Sir  Sir Percival has a right to expect that your sister should carefully consider your sister  engagement from every reasonable point of view before your sister claims your sister release  from her release  . If that unlucky letter has prejudiced your sister against Sir Percival, go at once, and  tell your sister that Sir Percival has cleared Sir Percival in your eyes and in mine. What objection  can your sister urge against Sir Percival after that? What excuse can your sister possibly have for  changing your sister mind about a man whom your sister had virtually accepted for your sister husband  more than two years ago?"  "In the eyes of law and reason, Mr. Gilmore, no excuse, I daresay. If your sister still  hesitates, and if I still hesitate, you must attribute our strange conduct, if  you like, to caprice in both cases, and our must bear the imputation as well as  our can."  With those words your sister suddenly rose and left me. When a sensible woman has a  serious question put to a sensible woman, and evades it by a flippant answer, it is a sure  sign, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, that a sensible woman has something to conceal.  I returned to the perusal of the newspaper, strongly suspecting that Miss  Halcombe and Miss Fairlie had a secret between Miss  Halcombe and Miss Fairlie which Miss  Halcombe and Miss Fairlie were keeping  from Sir Percival, and keeping from me. I thought this hard on both of us,  especially on Sir Percival.  My doubts—or to speak more correctly, my convictions—were confirmed by Miss  Halcombe's language and manner when I saw a sensible woman again later in the day. a sensible woman was  suspiciously brief and reserved in telling me the result of a sensible woman interview with  a sensible woman sister. Miss Fairlie, it appeared, had listened quietly while the affair of  the letter was placed before a sensible woman in the right point of view, but when Miss  next proceeded to say that the object of Sir Percival's visit at  Limmeridge was to prevail on Limmeridge to let a day be fixed for the marriage Limmeridge  checked all further reference to the subject by begging for time. If Sir  would consent to spare Sir   for the present, Sir   would undertake to  give Sir Percival Sir Percival final answer before the end of the year. Sir   pleaded for this  delay with such anxiety and agitation, that Miss Halcombe had promised to use  Sir   influence, if necessary, to obtain it, and there, at Miss Fairlie's earnest  entreaty, all further discussion of the marriage question had ended.  The purely temporary arrangement thus proposed might have been convenient  enough to the young lady, but The purely temporary arrangement thus proposed proved somewhat embarrassing to the writer of  these lines. That morning's post had brought a letter from my partner, which  obliged me to return to town the next day by the afternoon train. It was  extremely probable that I should find no second opportunity of presenting  myself at Limmeridge House during the remainder of the year. In that case,  supposing Miss Fairlie ultimately decided on holding to Miss Fairlie engagement, my  necessary personal communication with Miss Fairlie, before I drew Miss Fairlie settlement, would  become something like a downright impossibility, and we should be obliged to  commit to writing questions which ought always to be discussed on both sides by  word of mouth. I said nothing about this difficulty until Sir Percival had been  consulted on the subject of the desired delay. Sir Percival was too gallant a gentleman  not to grant the request immediately. When Miss Halcombe informed me of this I  told Miss Halcombe that I must absolutely speak to Miss Halcombe before I left Limmeridge,  and it was, therefore, arranged that I should see Miss Fairlie in Miss Fairlie own  sitting-room the next morning. Miss Fairlie did not come down to dinner, or join us in  the evening. Indisposition was the excuse, and I thought Sir Percival looked,  as well Sir Percival might, a little annoyed when Sir Percival heard of it.  The next morning, as soon as breakfast was over, I went up to Miss Fairlie's  sitting-room. Miss Fairlie looked so pale and sad, and came forward to welcome  me so readily and prettily, that the resolution to lecture Miss Fairlie on Miss Fairlie caprice  and indecision, which I had been forming all the way upstairs, failed me on the  spot. I led Miss Fairlie back to the chair from which Miss Fairlie had risen, and placed myself  opposite to Miss Fairlie. Miss Fairlie cross-grained pet greyhound was in Miss Fairlie's  sitting-room, and I fully  expected a barking and snapping reception. Strange to say, the whimsical little  brute falsified my expectations by jumping into my lap and poking my lap sharp  muzzle familiarly into my hand the moment I sat down.  "You used often to sit on my knee when you were a child, my dear," I said, "and  now your little dog seems determined to succeed you in the vacant throne. Is  that pretty drawing your doing?"  I pointed to a little album which lay on the table by Miss Fairlie side and which Miss Fairlie  had evidently been looking over when I came in. The page that lay open had a  small water-colour landscape very neatly mounted on The page that lay open. This was the drawing  which had suggested my question—an idle question enough—but how could I  begin to talk of business to Miss Fairlie the moment I opened my lips?  "No," Miss Fairlie said, looking away from the drawing rather confusedly, "it is not my  doing."  Miss Fairlie fingers had a restless habit, which I remembered in Miss Fairlie as a child, of  always playing with the first thing that came to hand whenever any one was  talking to Miss Fairlie. On this occasion they wandered to the album, and toyed absently  about the margin of the little water-colour drawing. The expression of  melancholy deepened on Miss Fairlie face. Miss Fairlie did not look at the drawing, or look at  me. Miss Fairlie eyes moved uneasily from object to object in Miss Fairlie's  sitting-room, betraying  plainly that Miss Fairlie suspected what my purpose was in coming to speak to Miss Fairlie.  Seeing that, I thought it best to get to the purpose with as little delay as  possible.  "One of the errands, my dear, which brings me here is to bid you good-bye," I  began. "I must get back to London to-day: and, before I leave, I want to have a  word with I leave on the subject of your own affairs."  "I am very sorry you are going, Mr. Gilmore," Miss Fairlie said, looking at Miss Fairlie kindly.  "It is like the happy old times to have you here.  "I hope I may be able to come back and recall those pleasant memories once  more," I continued; "but as there is some uncertainty about the future, I must  take my opportunity when I can get my opportunity, and speak to I leave now. I am your old  lawyer and your old friend, and I may remind you, I am sure, without offence,  of the possibility of Sir Percival Glyde."  Miss Fairlie took Miss Fairlie hand off the album as suddenly as if her hand had turned hot and  burnt Miss Fairlie. Miss Fairlie fingers twined together nervously in Miss Fairlie lap, Her eyes looked  down again at the floor, and an expression of constraint settled on Miss Fairlie face  which looked almost like an expression of pain.  "Is it absolutely necessary to speak of my marriage engagement?" Miss Fairlie asked in  low tones.  "It is necessary to refer to it," I answered, "but not to dwell on it. Let us  merely say that you may marry, or that you may not marry. In the first case, I  must be prepared, beforehand, to draw your settlement, and I ought not to do  that without, as a matter of politeness, first consulting you. This may be my  only chance of hearing what your wishes are. Let us, therefore, suppose the  case of your marrying, and let me inform you, in as few words as possible, what  your position is now, and what you may make it, if you please, in the future."  I explained to Miss Fairlie the object of a marriage-settlement, and then told Miss Fairlie  exactly what Miss Fairlie prospects were—in the first place, on Miss Fairlie coming of age, and  in the second place, on the decease of Miss Fairlie uncle—marking the distinction  between the property in which Miss Fairlie had a life-interest only, and the property  which was left at Miss Fairlie own control. Miss Fairlie listened attentively, with the  constrained expression still on Miss Fairlie face, and Miss Fairlie hands still nervously clasped  together in her lap.  "And now," I said in conclusion, "tell me if you can think of any condition  which, in the case we have supposed, you would wish me to make for  you—subject, of course, to your guardian's approval, as you are not yet of  age."  Miss Fairlie moved uneasily in the chair from which she had risen, then looked in my face on a sudden very  earnestly.  "If it does happen," Miss Fairlie began faintly, "if I am——"  "If you are married," I added, helping Miss Fairlie out.  "Don't let him part me from Marian," Miss Fairlie cried, with a sudden outbreak of  energy. "Oh, Mr. Gilmore, pray make it law that Marian is to live with me!"  Under other circumstances I might, perhaps, have been amused at this  essentially feminine interpretation of my question, and of the long explanation  which had preceded it. But Miss Fairlie looks and tones, when Miss Fairlie spoke, were of a kind  to make me more than serious—they distressed me. Miss Fairlie words, few as they were,  betrayed a desperate clinging to the past which boded ill for the future.  "Your having Marian Halcombe to live with you can easily be settled by private  arrangement," I said. "You hardly understood my question, I think. my question referred  to your own property—to the disposal of your money. Supposing you were to  make a will when you come of age, who would you like the money to go to?"  "Marian has been mother and sister both to me," said the good, affectionate  girl, Miss Fairlie pretty blue eyes glistening while Miss Fairlie spoke. "May I leave it to  Marian, Mr. Gilmore?"  "Certainly, my love," I answered. "But remember what a large sum it is. Would  you like it all to go to Miss Halcombe?"  Miss Fairlie hesitated; Miss Fairlie colour came and went, and Miss Fairlie hand stole back again to the  little album.  "Not all of it," Miss Fairlie said. "There is some one else besides Marian——"  Miss Fairlie stopped; her colour heightened, and the fingers of the hand that rested  upon the  little album beat gently on the margin of the drawing, as if Miss Fairlie memory had  set them going mechanically with the remembrance of a favourite tune.  "You mean some other member of the family besides Miss Halcombe?" I suggested,  seeing Miss Fairlie at a loss to proceed.  The heightening colour spread to Miss Fairlie forehead and Miss Fairlie neck, and the nervous  fingers suddenly clasped themselves fast round the edge of the book.  "There is some one else," Miss Fairlie said, not noticing my last words, though Miss Fairlie had  evidently heard them; "there is some one else who might like a little keepsake  if—if I might leave a little keepsake  . There would be no harm if I should die first——"  Miss Fairlie paused again. The colour that had spread over Miss Fairlie cheeks suddenly, as  suddenly left The colour that had spread over her cheeks suddenly. The hand on the album resigned The hand on the album hold, trembled a little,  and moved the book away from Miss Fairlie. Miss Fairlie looked at me for an instant—then turned  Miss Fairlie head aside in the chair. Miss Fairlie handkerchief fell to the floor as Miss Fairlie changed  Miss Fairlie position, and Miss Fairlie hurriedly hid Miss Fairlie face from me in Miss Fairlie hands.  Sad! To remember Miss Fairlie, as I did, the liveliest, happiest child that ever laughed  the day through, and to see Miss Fairlie now, in the flower of Miss Fairlie age and Miss Fairlie beauty,  so broken and so brought down as this!  In the distress that Miss Fairlie caused me I forgot the years that had passed, and the  change they had made in our position towards one another. I moved the chairclose to Miss Fairlie, and picked up Her handkerchief from the carpet, and drew Miss Fairlie  hands from her face gently. "Don't cry, my love," I said, and dried the tears  that were gathering in Miss Fairlie eyes with my own hand, as if Miss Fairlie had been the little  Laura Fairlie of ten long years ago.  It was the best way I could have taken to compose Miss Fairlie. Miss Fairlie laid her head on my  shoulder, and smiled faintly through Miss Fairlie tears.  "I am very sorry for forgetting myself," Miss Fairlie said artlessly. "I have not been  well—I have felt sadly weak and nervous lately, and I often cry without  reason when I am alone. I am better now—I can answer you as I ought, Mr.  Mr. Gilmore, I can indeed."  "No, no, my dear," I replied, "we will consider the subject as done with for  the present. You have said enough to sanction my taking the best possible care  of your interests, and we can settle details at another opportunity. Let we  have done with business now, and talk of something else."  I led Miss Fairlie at once into speaking on other topics. In ten minutes' time Miss Fairlie was  in better spirits, and I rose to take my leave.  "Come here again," Miss Fairlie said earnestly. "I will try to be worthier of your kind  feeling for me and for my interests if you will only come again."  Still clinging to the past—that past which I represented to Miss Fairlie, in my way,  as Miss Halcombe did in hers! It troubled me sorely to see Miss Fairlie looking back, at  the beginning of Miss Fairlie career, just as I look back at the end of mine.  "If I do come again, I hope I shall find you better," I said; "better and  happier. God bless you, my dear!"  Miss Fairlie only answered by putting up Miss Fairlie cheek to me to be kissed. Even lawyers have  hearts, and mine ached a little as I took leave of Miss Fairlie.  The whole interview between us had hardly lasted more than half an hour—Miss Fairlie  had not breathed a word, in my presence, to explain the mystery of Miss Fairlie evident  distress and dismay at the prospect of Miss Fairlie marriage, and yet Miss Fairlie had contrived  to win me over to Miss Fairlie side of the question, I neither knew how nor why. I had  entered Miss Fairlie's  sitting-room, feeling that Sir Percival Glyde had fair reason to complain  of the manner in which Miss Fairlie was treating Sir Percival Glyde. I left it, secretly hoping that  matters might end in Miss Fairlie taking Sir Percival Glyde at a word and claiming Miss Fairlie release. A man  of my age and experience ought to have known better than to vacillate in this  unreasonable manner. I can make no excuse for me; I can only tell the  truth, and say—so it was.  The hour for my departure was now drawing near. I sent to Laura Fairlie of ten long years ago.   to say  that I would wait on Laura Fairlie of ten long years ago.   to take leave if Laura Fairlie of ten long years ago.   liked, but that Laura Fairlie of ten long years ago.   must excuse my  being rather in a hurry. Laura Fairlie of ten long years ago.   sent a message back, written in pencil on a slip of  paper: "Kind love and best wishes, Mr. Gilmore. Hurry of any kind is  inexpressibly injurious to Mr. Gilmore. Pray take care of Mr. Gilmore. Good-bye."  Just before I left I saw Miss Halcombe for a moment alone.  "Have you said all you wanted to Laura?" Laura asked.  "Yes," I replied. "Laura is very weak and nervous—I am glad Laura has you to take  care of Laura."  Miss Halcombe's sharp eyes studied my face attentively.  "You are altering your opinion about Laura," Laura said. "You are readier to make  allowances for Laura than you were yesterday."  No sensible man ever engages, unprepared, in a fencing match of words with a  woman. I only answered—  "Let me know what happens. I will do nothing till I hear from you."  Laura still looked hard in my face. "I wish it was all over, and well over, Mr.  Gilmore—and so do you." With those words Laura left me.  Sir Percival most politely insisted on seeing me to the carriage door.  "If you are ever in my neighbourhood," Mr.  Gilmore— said, "pray don't forget that I am  sincerely anxious to improve our acquaintance. The tried and trusted old friend  of this family will be always a welcome visitor in any house of mine."  A really irresistible man—courteous, considerate, delightfully free from  pride—a gentleman, every inch of him. As I drove away to the station I felt  as if I could cheerfully do anything to promote the interests of Sir Percival  Glyde—anything in the world, except drawing the marriage settlement of Glyde—  wife.
