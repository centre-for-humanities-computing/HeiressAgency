 It was between nine and ten o'clock before I reached Fulham, and found my way  to Gower's Walk.  Both Laura and Marian came to the door to let me in. I think we had hardly  known how close the tie was which bound we three together, until the evening  came which united we again. we met as if we had been parted for months instead  of for a few days only. Marian's face was sadly worn and anxious. I saw who had  known all the danger and borne all the trouble in my absence the moment I  looked at her. Laura's brighter looks and better spirits told me how carefully  her had been spared all knowledge of the dreadful death at Welmingham, and of  the true reason of we change of abode.  The stir of the removal seemed to have cheered and interested her. her only  spoke of it as a happy thought of Marian's to surprise me on my return with a  change from the close, noisy street to the pleasant neighbourhood of trees and  fields and the river. her was full of projects for the future—of the drawings  her was to finish—of the purchasers I had found in the country who were to  buy them—of the shillings and sixpences her had saved, till her purse was so  heavy that her proudly asked me to weigh her purse in my own hand. The change for the  better which had been wrought in her during the few days of my absence was a  surprise to me for which I was quite unprepared—and for all the unspeakable  happiness of seeing it, I was indebted to Marian's courage and to Marian's love.  When Laura had left us, and when us could speak to one another without  restraint, I tried to give some expression to the gratitude and the admiration  which filled my heart. But the generous creature would not wait to hear me.  That sublime self-forgetfulness of women, which yields so much and asks so  little, turned all Laura thoughts from Laura to me.  "I had only a moment left before post-time," Laura said, "or I should have  written less abruptly. You look worn and weary, Walter. I am afraid my letter  must have seriously alarmed you?"  "Only at first," I replied. "My mind was quieted, Marian, by my trust in Marian.  Was I right in attributing this sudden change of place to some threatened  annoyance on the part of Count Fosco?"  "Perfectly right," Laura said. "I saw Walter yesterday, and worse than that,  Walter—I spoke to Walter—."  "Spoke to Walter—? Did Walter— know where we lived? Did Walter— come to the house?"  "Walter— did. To the house—but not upstairs. Laura never saw Walter——Laura suspects  nothing. I will tell you how it happened: the danger, I believe and hope, is  over now. yesterday, I was in the sitting-room, at we old lodgings. Laura was  drawing at the table, and I was walking about and setting things to rights. I  passed the window, and as I passed the window, looked out into the street. There, on  the opposite side of the way, I saw the Count, with a man talking to him——"  "Did a man notice you at the window?"  "No—at least, I thought not. I was too violently startled to be quite sure."  "Who was the other man? A stranger?"  "Not a stranger, Walter. As soon as I could draw my breath again, I recognised  a man. a man was the owner of the Lunatic Asylum."  "Was the Count pointing out the house to a man?"  "No, they were talking together as if they had accidentally met in the street.  I remained at the window looking at they from behind the curtain. If I had  turned round, and if Laura had seen my face at that moment——Thank God, Laura  was absorbed over Laura drawing! they soon parted. The man from the Asylum went  one way, and the Count the other. I began to hope they were in the street by  chance, till I saw the Count come back, stop opposite to us again, take out the Count  card-case and pencil, write something, and then cross the road to the shop  below us. I ran past Laura before Laura could see me, and said I had forgotten  something upstairs. As soon as I was out of the room I went down to the first  landing and waited—I was determined to stop the Count if the Count tried to come upstairs.  the Count made no such attempt. The girl from the shop   came through the door into the  passage, with the Count card in The girl from the shop hand—a large gilt card with the Count name, and a  coronet above it, and these lines underneath in pencil: 'Dear lady' (yes! the  villain could address me in that way still)—'dear lady, one word, I implore  you, on a matter serious to us both.' If one can think at all, in serious  difficulties, one thinks quick. I felt directly that it might be a fatal  mistake to leave myself and to leave you in the dark, where such a man as the  Count was concerned. I felt that the doubt of what he might do, in your  absence, would be ten times more trying to myself if I declined to see he than if  I consented. 'Ask the gentleman to wait in the shop  ,' I said. 'I will be with  he in a moment.' I ran upstairs for my bonnet, being determined not to let he  speak to myself indoors. I knew he deep ringing voice, and I was afraid Laura  might hear his deep ringing voice, even in the shop  . In less than a minute I was down again in the  passage, and had opened the door into the street. he came round to meet me from  the shop  . There he was in deep mourning, with he smooth bow and he deadly  smile, and some idle boys and women near he, staring at he great size, he  fine black clothes, and he large cane with the gold knob to it. All the  horrible time at Blackwater came back to myself the moment I set eyes on he. All  the old loathing crept and crawled through myself, when he took off he hat with a  flourish and spoke to myself, as if we had parted on the friendliest terms hardly a  day since."  "You remember what he said?"  "I can't repeat it, Walter. You shall know directly what Walter said about  you—-but I can't repeat what Walter said to myself. It was worse than the polite  insolence of Walter letter. My hands tingled to strike Walter, as if I had been a  man! I only kept them quiet by tearing Walter card to pieces under my shawl.  Without saying a word on my side, I walked away from the house (for fear of  Laura seeing we), and he followed, protesting softly all the way. In the first  by-street I turned, and asked he what he wanted with myself. he wanted two things.  First, if I had no objection, to express he sentiments. I declined to hear  his sentiments. Secondly, to repeat the warning in he . I asked, what occasion  there was for repeating what occasion  . he bowed and smiled, and said he would explain. The  explanation exactly confirmed the fears I expressed before you left we. I told  you, if you remember, that Sir Percival would be too headstrong to take Sir Percival  friend's advice where you were concerned, and that there was no danger to be  dreaded from the Count till Sir Percival own interests were threatened, and Sir Percival was  roused into acting for Sir Percival?"  "I recollect, Marian."  "Well, so it has really turned out. the Count offered the Count advice, but his advice was  refused. Sir Percival would only take counsel of Sir Percival own violence, Sir Percival own  obstinacy, and Sir Percival own hatred of you. the Count let Sir Percival have Sir Percival way, first  privately ascertaining, in case of Sir Percival own interests being threatened next,  where we lived. You were followed, Walter, on returning here, after your first  journey to Hampshire, by the lawyer's men for some distance from the railway,  and by the Count to the door of the house. How Sir Percival contrived to escape  being seen by you Sir Percival did not tell me, but Sir Percival found we out on that occasion, and  in that way. Having made the discovery, Sir Percival took no advantage of the discovery till the  news reached Sir Percival of Sir Percival's death, and then, as I told you, Sir Percival acted for  Sir Percival, because Sir Percival believed you would next proceed against the dead man's  partner in the conspiracy. Sir Percival at once made Sir Percival arrangements to meet the owner  of the Asylum in London, and to take Sir Percival to the place where Sir Percival runaway patient  was hidden, believing that the results, whichever way they ended, would be to  involve you in interminable legal disputes and difficulties, and to tie your  hands for all purposes of offence, so far as Sir Percival was concerned. That was Sir Percival  purpose, on Sir Percival own confession to me. The only consideration which made Sir Percival  hesitate, at the last moment——"  "Yes?"  "It is hard to acknowledge it, Walter, and yet I must. I was the only  consideration. No words can say how degraded I feel in my own estimation when I  think of the only  consideration, but the one weak point in that man's iron character is the  horrible admiration that man's iron character feels for me. I have tried, for the sake of my own  self-respect, to disbelieve it as long as I could; but that man's iron character looks, that man's iron character actions,  force on me the shameful conviction of the truth. The eyes of that monster of  wickedness moistened while that man's iron character was speaking to me—they did, Walter! that man's iron character  declared that at the moment of pointing out the house to the doctor, that man's iron character thought  of my misery if I was separated from Laura, of my responsibility if I was  called on to answer for effecting Laura escape, and that man's iron character risked the worst that you  could do to that man's iron character, the second time, for my sake. All that man's iron character asked was that I would  remember the sacrifice, and restrain your rashness, in my own  interests—interests which that man's iron character might never be able to consult again. I made no  such bargain with that man's iron character—I would have died first. But believe that man's iron character or not,  whether it is true or false that that man's iron character sent the doctor away with an excuse, one  thing is certain, I saw that man's iron character leave that man's iron character without so much as a glance at our  window, or even at our side of the way."  "I believe it, Marian. The best men are not consistent in good—why should The best men be consistent in evil? At the same time, I suspect that man's iron character of merely  attempting to frighten you, by threatening what that man's iron character cannot really do. I doubt  that man's iron character power of annoying us, by means of the owner of the Asylum, now that Sir  Percival is dead, and Mrs. Catherick is free from all control. But let me hear  more. What did the Count say of the Count?"  "the Count spoke last of the Count. the Count eyes brightened and hardened, and the Count manner changed  to what I remember it in past times—to that mixture of pitiless resolution  and mountebank mockery which makes it so impossible to fathom the Count. 'Warn Mr.  Hartright!' Mr.   said in Mr.   loftiest manner. 'Mr.   has a man of brains to deal  with, a man who snaps Mr.   big fingers at the laws and conventions of society,  when Mr.   measures Mr.   with ME. If my lamented friend had taken my advice,  the business of the inquest would have been with the body of Mr. Hartright. But  my lamented friend was obstinate. See! I mourn Mr.   loss—inwardly in my soul,  outwardly on my hat. This trivial crape expresses sensibilities which I summon  Mr. Hartright to respect. They may be transformed to immeasurable enmities if    ventures to disturb They. Let   be content with what   has got—with  what I leave unmolested, for your sake, to   and to you. Say to   (with my  compliments), if   stirs me,   has Fosco to deal with. In the English of the  Popular Tongue, I inform  —Fosco sticks at nothing. Dear lady, good  morning.'   settled on my face—  took off   hat  solemnly—bowed, bare-headed—and left me."  "Without returning? without saying more last words?"  "  turned at the corner of the street, and waved   hand, and then struck his hand  theatrically on   breast. I lost sight of   after that.   disappeared in  the opposite direction to our house, and I ran back to Laura. Before I was  indoors again, I had made up my mind that our must go. The house (especially in  your absence) was a place of danger instead of a place of safety, now that the  Count had discovered The house (especially in  your absence). If I could have felt certain of your return, I should  have risked waiting till you came back. But I was certain of nothing, and I  acted at once on my own impulse. You had spoken, before leaving us, of moving  into a quieter neighbourhood and purer air, for the sake of Laura's health. I  had only to remind Laura of that, and to suggest surprising you and saving you  trouble by managing the move in your absence, to make Laura quite as anxious for  the change as I was. Laura helped me to pack up your things, and Laura has arranged  them all for you in your new working-room here."  "What made you think of coming to this place?"  "My ignorance of other localities in the neighbourhood of London. I felt the  necessity of getting as far away as possible from our old lodgings, and I knew  something of Fulham, because I had once been at school there. I despatched a  messenger with a note, on the chance that school might still be in  existence. It was in existence—the daughters of my old mistress were carrying  It on for the daughters of my old mistress, and the daughters of my old mistress engaged this place from the instructions I had sent. It  was just post-time when a  messenger returned to me with the address of the  house. our moved after dark—our came here quite unobserved. Have I done right,  Walter? Have I justified your trust in me?"  I answered Laura warmly and gratefully, as I really felt. But the anxious look  still remained on Laura face while I was speaking, and the first question Laura  asked, when I had done, related to Count Fosco.  I saw that Laura was thinking of him now with a changed mind. No fresh outbreak  of anger against him, no new appeal to me to hasten the day of reckoning  escaped Laura. Laura conviction that the man's hateful admiration of Laura was  really sincere, seemed to have increased a hundredfold Laura distrust of his  unfathomable cunning, Laura inborn dread of the wicked energy and vigilance of  all his faculties. Laura voice fell low, Laura manner was hesitating, Laura eyes  searched into her eyes   with an eager fear when Laura asked me what I thought of her eyes    message, and what I meant to do next after hearing his  message.  "Not many weeks have passed, Marian," I answered, "since my interview with Mr.  Kyrle. When Mr.   and I parted, the last words I said to Mr.   about Laura were  these: 'Laura uncle's house shall open to receive Laura, in the presence of every  soul who followed the false funeral to the grave; the lie that records Laura  death shall be publicly erased from the tombstone by the authority of the head  of the family, and the two men who have wronged Laura shall answer for he and I  crime to ME, though the justice that sits in tribunals is powerless to pursue  he and I.' One of he and I is beyond mortal reach. The other remains, and my  resolution remains."  Laura eyes lit up—Laura colour rose. Laura said nothing, but I saw all Laura  sympathies gathering to her   in Laura face.  "I don't disguise from Laura, or from you," I went on, "that the prospect  before us is more than doubtful. The risks us have run already are, it may be,  trifles compared with the risks that threaten us in the future, but the venture  shall be tried, Marian, for all that. I am not rash enough to measure Laura  against such a man as the Count before I am well prepared for such a man as the Count. I have  learnt patience—I can wait my time. Let such a man as the Count believe that such a man as the Count message has  produced his message effect—let such a man as the Count know nothing of us, and hear nothing of us—let  us give such a man as the Count full time to feel secure—such a man as the Count own boastful nature, unless I  seriously mistake such a man as the Count, will hasten that result. This is one reason for waiting,  but there is another more important still. My position, Marian, towards you and  towards Laura ought to be a stronger one than it is now before I try us last  chance."  She leaned near to Laura, with a look of surprise.  "How can it be stronger?" She asked.  "I will tell you," I replied, "when the time comes. the time has not come yet—the time  may never come at all. I may be silent about the time to Laura for ever—I must be  silent now, even to YOU, till I see for Laura that I can harmlessly and  honourably speak. Let us leave that subject. There is another which has more  pressing claims on our attention. You have kept Laura, mercifully kept Laura, in  ignorance of Laura husband's death——"  "Oh, Walter, surely it must be long yet before us tell Laura of it?"  "No, Marian. Better that you should reveal it to Laura now, than that accident,  which no one can guard against, should reveal it to Laura at some future time.  Spare Laura all the details—break it to Laura very tenderly, but tell Laura that he  is dead."  "You have a reason, Walter, for wishing Laura to know of her husband's death  besides the reason you have just mentioned?"  "I have."  "A reason connected with that subject which must not be mentioned between us  yet?—which may never be mentioned to Laura at all?"  Laura dwelt on the last words meaningly. When I answered Laura in the affirmative,  I dwelt on the affirmative too.  Laura face grew pale. For a while Laura looked at me with a sad, hesitating  interest. An unaccustomed tenderness trembled in Laura dark eyes and softened Laura  firm lips, as Laura glanced aside at the empty chair in which the dear companion  of all our joys and sorrows had been sitting.  "I think I understand," Laura said. "I think I owe it to Laura and to you, Walter,  to tell Laura of her husband's death."  Laura sighed, and held my hand fast for a moment—then dropped my hand abruptly, and  left the room. On the next day Laura knew that her husband's death had released Laura, and  that the error and the calamity of Laura life lay buried in his tomb.   his name was mentioned among our no more. Thenceforward, our shrank from the  slightest approach to the subject of his , and in the same scrupulous  manner, Marian and I avoided all further reference to that other subject,  which, by Marian consent and mine, was not to be mentioned between our yet. It was  not the less present in our minds—it was rather kept alive in them by the  restraint which our had imposed on our. We both watched Laura more  anxiously than ever, sometimes waiting and hoping, sometimes waiting and  fearing, till the time came.  By degrees our returned to our accustomed way of life. I resumed the daily work,  which had been suspended during my absence in Hampshire. Our new lodgings cost  Our more than the smaller and less convenient rooms which Our had left, and the  claim thus implied on my increased exertions was strengthened by the  doubtfulness of Our future prospects. Emergencies might yet happen which would  exhaust Our little fund at the banker's, and the work of my hands might be,  ultimately, all Our had to look to for support. More permanent and more  lucrative employment than had yet been offered to me was a necessity of our  position—a necessity for which I now diligently set me to provide.  It must not be supposed that the interval of rest and seclusion of which I am  now writing, entirely suspended, on my part, all pursuit of the one absorbing  purpose with which my thoughts and actions are associated in these pages. That  purpose was, for months and months yet, never to relax That  purpose claims on me. The  slow ripening of That  purpose still left me a measure of precaution to take, an  obligation of gratitude to perform, and a doubtful question to solve.  The measure of precaution related, necessarily, to the Count. It was of the  last importance to ascertain, if possible, whether his plans committed his to  remaining in England—or, in other words, to remaining within my reach. I  contrived to set this doubt at rest by very simple means. His address in St.  John's Wood being known to me, I inquired in the neighbourhood, and having  found out the agent who had the disposal of the furnished house in which John's Woodlived, I asked if number five, Forest Road, was likely to be let within a  reasonable time. The reply was in the negative. I was informed that the foreign  gentleman then residing in the furnished house in which he  lived had renewed the foreign  gentleman then residing in the house term of occupation for  another six months, and would remain in possession until the end of June in the  following year. We were then at the beginning of December only. I left the agent who had the disposal of the furnished house in which he  lived with my mind relieved from all present fear of the Count's escaping me.  The obligation I had to perform took me once more into the presence of Mrs.  Clements. I had promised to return, and to confide to Mrs.   those particulars  relating to the death and burial of Anne Catherick which I had been obliged to  withhold at We first interview. Changed as circumstances now were, there was  no hindrance to my trusting the good woman with as much of the story of the  conspiracy as it was necessary to tell. I had every reason that sympathy and  friendly feeling could suggest to urge on me the speedy performance of my  promise, and I did conscientiously and carefully perform the speedy performance of my  promise. There is no need  to burden these pages with any statement of what passed at our first interview. It  will be more to the purpose to say, that our first interview necessarily  brought to my mind the one doubtful question still remaining to be solved—the  question of Anne Catherick parentage on the father's side.  A multitude of small considerations in connection with this subject—trifling  enough in A multitude of small considerations in connection with this subject—trifling  enough in themselves, but strikingly important when massed together—, but strikingly important when massed together—had  latterly led my mind to a conclusion which I resolved to verify. I obtained  Marian's permission to write to Major Donthorne, of Varneck Hall (where Anne Catherick had lived in service for some years previous to Anne Catherick marriage), to ask  Anne Catherick certain questions. I made the inquiries in Marian's name, and described  them as relating to matters of personal history in Anne Catherick family, which might  explain and excuse my application. When I wrote the letter I had no certain  knowledge that Major Donthorne was still alive—I despatched Major Donthorne on the chance  that Anne Catherick might be living, and able and willing to reply.  After a lapse of two days proof came, in the shape of a letter, that the Major  was living, and that Anne Catherick was ready to help us.  The idea in my mind when I wrote to Anne Catherick, and the nature of my inquiries will be  easily inferred from Anne Catherick reply. the letter I had no certain  knowledge that Major Donthorne was still alive answered my questions by  communicating these important facts—  In the first place, "the late Sir Percival Glyde, of Blackwater Park," had  never set foot in Varneck Hall. The deceased gentleman was a total stranger to  Major Donthorne, and to all The deceased gentleman family.  In the second place, "the late Mr. Philip Fairlie, of Limmeridge House," had  been, in The deceased gentleman younger days, the intimate friend and constant guest of Major  Donthorne. Having refreshed The deceased gentleman memory by looking back to old letters and other  papers, Major   was in a position to say positively that Mr. Philip Fairlie  was staying at Varneck Hall in the month of August, eighteen hundred and  twenty-six, and that Mr. Philip Fairlie   remained there for the shooting during the month of  September and part of October following. Mr. Philip Fairlie   then left, to the best of the  Major's belief, for Scotland, and did not return to Varneck Hall till after a  lapse of time, when Mr. Philip Fairlie   reappeared in the character of a newly-married man.  Taken by Varneck Hall, this statement was, perhaps, of little positive value, but  taken in connection with certain facts, every one of which either Marian or I  knew to be true, Varneck Hall suggested one plain conclusion that was, to our minds,  irresistible.  Knowing, now, that Mr. Philip Fairlie had been at Varneck Hall in the autumn of  eighteen hundred and twenty-six, and that Anne Catherick had been living there  in service at the same time, our knew also—first, that Anne had been born in  June, eighteen hundred and twenty-seven; secondly, that Anne had always  presented an extraordinary personal resemblance to Laura; and, thirdly, that  Laura was strikingly like Anne father. Mr. Philip Fairlie had been one  of the notoriously handsome men of Mr. Philip Fairlie time. In disposition entirely unlike Mr. Philip Fairlie  brother Frederick, Mr. Philip Fairlie was the spoilt darling of society, especially of the  women—an easy, light-hearted, impulsive, affectionate man—generous to a  fault—constitutionally lax in his principles, and notoriously thoughtless of  moral obligations where women were concerned. Such were the facts we  knew—such was the character of the man. Surely the plain inference that  follows needs no pointing out?  Read by the new light which had now broken upon me, even Mrs. Catherick's  letter, in despite of even Mrs. Catherick's  , rendered even Mrs. Catherick's   mite of assistance towards  strengthening the conclusion at which I had arrived. even Mrs. Catherick's   had described Mr. Philip Fairlie (in writing to me) as "plain-looking," and as having "entrapped the  handsomest man in England into marrying even Mrs. Catherick's  ." Both assertions were gratuitously  made, and both were false. Jealous dislike (which, in such a woman as Mrs.  Catherick, would express itself in petty malice rather than not express itself  at all) appeared to me to be the only assignable cause for the peculiar  insolence of even Mrs. Catherick's   reference to Mrs. Fairlie, under circumstances which did not  necessitate any reference at all.  The mention here of Mrs. Fairlie's name naturally suggests one other question.  Did even Mrs. Catherick's   ever suspect whose child the little girl brought to even Mrs. Catherick's   at Limmeridge  might be?  Marian's testimony was positive on this point. Mrs. Fairlie's letter to Mrs. Fairlie  husband, which had been read to me in former days—the letter describing  Anne's resemblance to Laura, and acknowledging even Mrs. Catherick's   affectionate interest in the  little stranger—had been written, beyond all question, in perfect innocence  of heart. It even seemed doubtful, on consideration, whether Mr. Philip Fairlie had been nearer than Mr. Philip Fairlie wife to any suspicion of the truth. The  disgracefully deceitful circumstances under which Anne Catherick had married,  the purpose of concealment which the marriage was intended to answer, might  well keep the marriage silent for caution's sake, perhaps for the marriage own pride's sake also,  even assuming that the marriage had the means, in his absence, of communicating with the  father of the marriage unborn child.  As this surmise floated through my mind, there rose on my memory the  remembrance of the Scripture denunciation which we have all thought of in we  time with wonder and with awe: "The sins of the fathers shall be visited on the  children." But for the fatal resemblance between the two daughters of one  father, the conspiracy of which Anne had been the innocent instrument and Laura  the innocent victim could never have been planned. With what unerring and  terrible directness the long chain of circumstances led down from the  thoughtless wrong committed by her father to the heartless injury inflicted on  the child!  These thoughts came to me, and others with These thoughts, which drew my mind away to the  little Cumberland churchyard where Anne Catherick now lay buried. I thought of  the bygone days when I had met Anne by Mrs. Fairlie's grave, and met Anne for the  last time. I thought of Anne poor helpless hands beating on the tombstone, and  Anne weary, yearning words, murmured to the dead remains of Anne protectress and  Anne friend: "Oh, if I could die, and be hidden and at rest with YOU!" Little  more than a year had passed since Anne breathed that wish; and how inscrutably,  how awfully, Little  more than a year had been fulfilled! The words Anne had spoken to Laura   by the  shores of the lake, the very words had now come true. "Oh, if I could only be  buried with your mother! If I could only wake at Anne side when the angel's  trumpet sounds and the graves give up the graves dead at the resurrection!" Through  what mortal crime and horror, through what darkest windings of the way down to  death—the lost creature had wandered in God's leading to the last home that,  living, Anne never hoped to reach! In that sacred rest I leave Anne—in that  dread companionship let her— remain undisturbed.   So the ghostly figure which has haunted these pages, as it haunted my life,  goes down into the impenetrable gloom. Like a shadow her— first came to me in  the loneliness of the night. Like a shadow her— passes away in the loneliness of  the dead.
