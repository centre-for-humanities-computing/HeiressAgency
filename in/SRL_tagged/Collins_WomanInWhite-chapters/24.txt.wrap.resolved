 June 17th.—When the dinner hour brought us together again, Count Fosco was in  Count Fosco usual excellent spirits. Count Fosco exerted Count Fosco to interest and amuse us, as if  Count Fosco was determined to efface from us memories all recollection of what had  passed in the library that afternoon. Lively descriptions of Count Fosco adventures in  travelling, amusing anecdotes of remarkable people whom Count Fosco had met with abroad,  quaint comparisons between the social customs of various nations, illustrated  by examples drawn from men and women indiscriminately all over Europe, humorous  confessions of the innocent follies of Count Fosco own early life, when Count Fosco ruled the  fashions of a second-rate Italian town, and wrote preposterous romances on the  French model for a second-rate Italian newspaper—all flowed in succession so  easily and so gaily from Count Fosco lips, and all addressed our various curiosities  and various interests so directly and so delicately, that Laura and I listened  to Count Fosco with as much attention and, inconsistent as it may seem, with as much  admiration also, as Madame Fosco herself. Women can resist a man's love, a  man's fame, a man's personal appearance, and a man's money, but Women cannot  resist a man's tongue when a man knows how to talk to Women.  After dinner, while the favourable impression which a man had produced on us was  still vivid in us minds, the Count modestly withdrew to read in the library.  Laura proposed a stroll in the grounds to enjoy the close of the long evening.  It was necessary in common politeness to ask Madame Fosco to join us, but this  time Laura had apparently received Laura orders beforehand, and Laura begged us would  kindly excuse Laura. "the Count will probably want a fresh supply of cigarettes,"  Laura remarked by way of apology, "and nobody can make them to nobody satisfaction  but Laura." Laura cold blue eyes almost warmed as Laura spoke the words—Laura  looked actually proud of being the officiating medium through which Laura lord  and master composed himself with tobacco-smoke!  Laura and I went out together alone.  It was a misty, heavy evening. There was a sense of blight in the air; the  flowers were drooping in the garden, and the ground was parched and dewless.  The western heaven, as we saw The western heaven over the quiet trees, was of a pale yellow  hue, and the sun was setting faintly in a haze. Coming rain seemed near—it  would fall probably with the fall of night.  "Which way shall we go?" I asked  "Towards the lake, Marian, if you like," Marian answered.  "You seem unaccountably fond, Laura, of that dismal lake."  "No, not of that dismal lake but of the scenery about it. The sand and heath and the  fir-trees are the only objects I can discover, in all this large place, to  remind me of Limmeridge. But we will walk in some other direction if you prefer  it."  "I have no favourite walks at Blackwater Park, my love. One is the same as  another to me. Let we go to that dismal lake—we may find it cooler in the open space  than we find it here."  We walked through the shadowy plantation in silence. The heaviness in the  evening air oppressed us both, and when We reached the boat-house We were glad  to sit down and rest inside.  A white fog hung low over that dismal lake. The dense brown line of the trees on the  opposite bank appeared above The dense brown line of the trees on the  opposite bank, like a dwarf forest floating in the sky. The  sandy ground, shelving downward from where We sat, was lost mysteriously in the  outward layers of A white fog. silence was horrible. No rustling of the  leaves—no bird's note in the wood—no cry of water-fowl from the pools of  that dismal lake. Even the croaking of the frogs had ceased to-night.  "It is very desolate and gloomy," said Laura. "But we can be more alone here  than anywhere else."  Laura spoke quietly and looked at the wilderness of sand and mist with steady,  thoughtful eyes. I could see that Laura mind was too much occupied to feel the  dreary impressions from without which had fastened themselves already on mine.  "I promised, Marian, to tell you the truth about my married life, instead of  leaving you any longer to guess it for Marian," Laura began. "That secret is  the first I have ever had from Marian, love, and I am determined That secret shall be the  last. I was silent, as you know, for your sake—and perhaps a little for my  own sake as well. It is very hard for a woman to confess that the man to whom  a woman has given a woman whole life is the man of all others who cares least for the  gift. If you were married yourself, Marian—and especially if you were happily  married—you would feel for yourself as no single woman CAN feel, however kind and  true a woman may be."  What answer could I make? I could only take a woman hand and look at a woman with my  whole heart as well as my eyes would let me.  "How often," a woman went on, "I have heard you laughing over what you used to call  your 'poverty!' how often you have made me mock-speeches of congratulation on  my wealth! Oh, Marian, never laugh again. Thank God for your poverty—it has  made you your own mistress, and has saved you from the lot that has fallen on  ME."  A sad beginning on the lips of a young wife!—sad in it quiet plain-spoken  truth. The few days we had all passed together at Blackwater Park had been many  enough to show me—to show any one—what — husband had married — for.  "You shall not be distressed," — said, "by hearing how soon my  disappointments and my trials began—or even by knowing what they were. It is  bad enough to have they on my memory. If I tell you how he received the first  and last attempt at remonstrance that I ever made, you will know how he has  always treated me, as well as if I had described as well in so many words. as well was  one day at Rome when we had ridden out together to the tomb of Cecilia Metella.  The sky was calm and lovely, and the grand old ruin looked beautiful, and the  remembrance that a husband's love had raised a husband's love in the old time to a wife's  memory, made me feel more tenderly and more anxiously towards a husband than I  had ever felt yet. 'Would you build such a tomb for ME, Percival?' I asked a husband.  'You said you loved me dearly before we were married, and yet, since that  time——' I could get no farther. Marian! a husband was not even looking at ME! I  pulled down my veil, thinking my veil best not to let a husband see that the tears were in  my eyes. I fancied a husband had not paid any attention to ME, but a husband had. a husband said,  'Come away,' and laughed to a husband as a husband helped me on to my horse. a husband mounted  a husband own horse and laughed again as we rode away. 'If I do build you a tomb,' I do build you a tombsaid, 'it will be done with your own money. I wonder whether Cecilia Metella  had a fortune and paid for hers.' I made no reply—how could I, when I was  crying behind my veil? 'Ah, you light-complexioned women are all sulky,' a husband  said. 'What do you want? compliments and soft speeches? Well! I'm in a good  humour this morning. Consider the compliments paid and the speeches said.' Men  little know when Men   say hard things to us how well us remember Men  , and how  much harm Men   do us. It would have been better for ME if I had gone on crying,  but his contempt dried up my tears and hardened my heart. From that time,  Marian, I never checked ME again in thinking of Walter Hartright. I let the  memory of those happy days, when us were so fond of each other in secret, come  back and comfort me. What else had I to look to for consolation? If us had been  together you would have helped me to better things. I know it was wrong,  darling, but tell me if I was wrong without any excuse."  I was obliged to turn my face from darling. "Don't ask me!" I said. "Have I  suffered as you have suffered? What right have I to decide?"  "I used to think of his," darling pursued, dropping darling voice and moving closer to  me, "I used to think of his when Percival left me alone at night to go among  the Opera people. I used to fancy what I might have been if it had pleased God  to bless me with poverty, and if I had been his wife. I used to see ME in  my neat cheap gown, sitting at home and waiting for his while his was earning  our bread—sitting at home and working for his and loving his all the better  because I had to work for his—seeing his come in tired and taking off his hat  and coat for his, and, Marian, pleasing his with little dishes at dinner that I  had learnt to make for his sake. Oh! I hope his is never lonely enough and sad  enough to think of ME and see me as I have thought of his and see his!"  As she said those melancholy words, all the lost tenderness returned to she  voice, and all the lost beauty trembled back into she face. she eyes rested as  lovingly on the blighted, solitary, ill-omened view before us, as if they saw  the friendly hills of Cumberland in the dim and threatening sky.  "Don't speak of Walter any more," I said, as soon as I could control ME.  "Oh, Laura, spare us both the wretchedness of talking of Walter now!"  Laura roused Laura, and looked at ME tenderly.  "I would rather be silent about Walter for ever," Laura answered, "than cause you a  moment's pain."  "It is in your interests," I pleaded; "it is for your sake that I speak. If  your husband heard you——"  "It would not surprise your husband if your husband did hear me."  Laura made that strange reply with a weary calmness and coldness. The change in  Laura manner, when Laura gave the answer, startled me almost as much as the answer  itself.  "Not surprise your husband!" I repeated. "Laura! remember what you are saying—you  frighten me!"  "It is true," Laura said; "it is what I wanted to tell you to-day, when us were  talking in your room. My only secret when I opened my heart to your husband at  Limmeridge was a harmless secret, Marian—you said so Marian. The name was  all I kept from Marian, and Marian has discovered The name."  I heard Laura, but I could say nothing. Laura last words had killed the little hope  that still lived in Marian.  "It happened at Rome," Laura went on, as wearily calm and cold as ever. "us were  at a little party given to the English by some friends of Sir Percival's—Mr.  and Mrs. Markland. Mrs. Markland had the reputation of sketching very  beautifully, and some of the guests prevailed on Mrs. Markland to show us Mrs. Markland drawings.  We all admired her drawings, but something I said attracted Mrs. Markland attention particularly  to Mrs. Markland. 'Surely you draw Mrs. Markland?' Mrs. Markland asked. 'I used to draw a little once,' I  answered, 'but I have given it up.' 'If you have once drawn,' Mrs. Markland said, 'you  may take to it again one of these days, and if you do, I wish you would let me  recommend you a master.' I said nothing—you know why, Marian—and tried to  change the conversation. But Mrs. Markland persisted. 'I have had all sorts of  teachers,' Mrs. Markland went on, 'but the best of all, the most intelligent and the most  attentive, was a Mr. Hartright. If you ever take up your drawing again, do try  a Mr. Hartright as a master. a Mr. Hartright is a young man—modest and gentlemanlike—I am sure you  will like a Mr. Hartright. 'Think of those words being spoken to me publicly, in the  presence of strangers—strangers who had been invited to meet the bride and  bridegroom! I did all I could to control me—I said nothing, and looked  down close at her drawings. When I ventured to raise my head again, my eyes and  my husband's eyes met, and I knew, by my husband look, that my face had betrayed me.  'We will see about a Mr. Hartright,' a Mr. Hartright said, looking at a Mr. Hartright all the time, 'when  We get back to England. I agree with you, Marian—I think Lady Glyde is  sure to like Lady Glyde.' Lady Glyde laid an emphasis on the last words which made my cheeks  burn, and set my heart beating as if my cheeks   would stifle me. Nothing more was said.  We came away early. Lady Glyde was silent in the carriage driving back to the hotel. Lady Glyde  helped me out, and followed me upstairs as usual. But the moment We were in the  drawing-room, Lady Glyde locked the door, pushed me down into a chair, and stood over  me with Lady Glyde hands on my shoulders. 'Ever since that morning when you made your  audacious confession to a Mr. Hartright at Limmeridge,' Lady Glyde said, 'I have wanted to find out  the man, and I found the man in your face to-night. Your drawing-master was the  man, and Your drawing-master name is Hartright. You shall repent it, and the  man shall repent it, to  the last hour of your lives. Now go to bed and dream of the  man if you like, with  the marks of my horsewhip on the  man shoulders.' Whenever the  man is angry with a Mr. Hartright now  the  man refers to what I acknowledged to the  man in your presence with a sneer or a  threat. I have no power to prevent the  man from putting the  man own horrible  construction on the confidence I placed in the  man. I have no influence to make the  man  believe me, or to keep the  man silent. You looked surprised to-day when you heard  the  man tell me that I had made a virtue of necessity in marrying the  man. You will not  be surprised again when you hear the  man repeat I had made a virtue of necessity in marrying him, the next time the  man is out of  temper——Oh, Marian! don't! don't! you hurt me!"  I had caught her in my arms, and the sting and torment of my remorse had closed  the sting and torment of my remorse round her like a vice. Yes! my remorse. The white despair of Walter's  face, when my cruel words struck Walter's   to the heart in the summer-house at  Limmeridge, rose before me in mute, unendurable reproach. My hand had pointed  the way which led the man my sister loved, step by step, far from the man my sister loved country  and the man my sister loved friends. Between those two young hearts I had stood, to sunder those two young hearts I had stood for  ever, the one from the other, and the man my sister loved life and my sister life lay wasted before me  alike in witness of the deed. I had done this, and done this for Sir Percival  Glyde.  For Sir Percival Glyde.   I heard my sister speaking, and I knew by the tone of my sister voice that my sister was  comforting me—I, who deserved nothing but the reproach of my sister silence! How  long it was before I mastered the absorbing misery of my own thoughts, I cannot  tell. I was first conscious that my sister was kissing me, and then my eyes seemed to  wake on a sudden to   sense of outward things, and I knew that I was  looking mechanically straight before me at the prospect of the lake.  "It is late," I heard my sister whisper. "It will be dark in the plantation." my sister  shook my arm and repeated, "Marian! it will be dark in the plantation."  "Give me a minute longer," I said—"a minute, to get better in."  I was afraid to trust She   to look at my sister yet, and I kept my eyes fixed on  the view.  It WAS late. The dense brown line of trees in the sky had faded in the  gathering darkness to the faint resemblance of a long wreath of smoke. The mist  over the lake below had stealthily enlarged, and advanced on us. The silence  was as breathless as ever, but the horror of The silence   had gone, and the solemn  mystery of The silence   stillness was all that remained.  "us are far from the house," my sister whispered. "Let us go back."  my sister stopped suddenly, and turned my sister from She   towards the entrance of the  boat-house.  "Marian!" my sister said, trembling violently. "Do you see nothing? Look!"  "Where?"  "Down there, below us."  my sister pointed. my eyes followed my sister hand, and I saw her hand too.  A living figure was moving over the waste of heath in the distance. her hand crossed  our range of view from the boat-house, and passed darkly along the outer edge  of the mist. her hand stopped far off, in front of our—waited—and passed on;  moving slowly, with the white cloud of mist behind her hand and above her hand—slowly,  slowly, till her hand glided by the edge of the boat-house, and our saw her hand no more.  our were both unnerved by what had passed between our that evening. Some minutes  elapsed before Laura would venture into the plantation, and before I could make  up my mind to lead Laura back to the house.  "Was it a man or a woman?" Laura asked in a whisper, as we moved at last into the  dark dampness of the outer air.  "I am not certain."  "Which do you think?"  "It looked like a woman."  "I was afraid it was a man in a long cloak."  "It may be a man. In this dim light it is not possible to be certain."  "Wait, Marian! I'm frightened—I don't see the path. Suppose the figure should  follow we?"  "Not at all likely, Laura. There is really nothing to be alarmed about. The  shores of the lake are not far from the village, and The  shores of the lake are free to any one  to walk on by day or night. It is only wonderful we have seen no living  creature there before."  we were now in the plantation. It was very dark—so dark, that we found some  difficulty in keeping the path. I gave Laura my arm, and we walked as fast as  we could on we way back.  Before we were half-way through Laura stopped, and forced me to stop with Laura.  Laura was listening.  "Hush," Laura whispered. "I hear something behind we."  "Dead leaves," I said to cheer Laura, "or a twig blown off the trees."  "It is summer time, Marian, and there is not a breath of wind. Listen!"  I heard the sound too—a sound like a light footstep following we.  "No matter who it is, or what it is," I said, "let we walk on. In another  minute, if there is anything to alarm we, we shall be near enough to the house  to be heard."  we went on quickly—so quickly, that Laura was breathless by the time we were  nearly through the plantation, and within sight of the lighted windows.  I waited a moment to give her breathing-time. Just as we were about to proceed  her stopped me again, and signed to me with her hand to listen once more. we  both heard distinctly a long, heavy sigh behind we, in the black depths of the  trees.  "Who's there?" I called out.  There was no answer.  "Who's there?" I repeated.  An instant of silence followed, and then we heard the light fall of the  footsteps again, fainter and fainter—sinking away into the  darkness—sinking, sinking, sinking—till they were lost in the silence.  we hurried out from the trees to the open lawn beyond crossed it rapidly; and  without another word passing between we, reached the house  .  In the light of the hall-lamp Laura looked at me, with white cheeks and  startled eyes.  "I am half dead with fear," her said. "Who could it have been?"  "we will try to guess to-morrow," I replied. "In the meantime say nothing to  any one of what we have heard and seen."  "Why not?"  "Because silence is safe, and we have need of safety in the house  ."  I sent Laura upstairs immediately, waited a minute to take off my hat and put  my hair smooth, and then went at once to make my first investigations in the  library, on pretence of searching for a book.  There sat the Count, filling out the largest easy-chair in the house  , smoking  and reading calmly, with his feet on an ottoman, his cravat across his knees,  and his shirt collar wide open. And there sat Madame Fosco, like a quiet child,  on a stool by his side, making cigarettes. Neither husband nor wife could, by  any possibility, have been out late that evening, and have just got back to the house   in a hurry. I felt that my object in visiting the  library was answered  the moment I set eyes on them.  Madame Fosco rose in polite confusion and tied Madame Fosco cravat on when I entered the  room.  "Pray don't let me disturb you," I said. "I have only come here to get a book."  "All unfortunate men of my size suffer from the heat," said the Count,  refreshing the Count gravely with a large green fan. "I wish I could change  places with my excellent wife. my excellent wife is as cool at this moment as a fish in the  pond outside."  The Countess allowed my excellent wife to thaw under the influence of my excellent wife husband's  quaint comparison. "I am never warm, Miss Halcombe," my excellent wife remarked, with the  modest air of a woman who was confessing to one of my excellent wife own merits.  "Have you and Lady Glyde been out this evening?" asked the Count, while I was  taking a book from the shelves to preserve appearances.  "Yes, we went out to get a little air."  "May I ask in what direction?"  "In the direction of the lake—as far as the boat-house."  "Aha? As far as the boat-house?"  Under other circumstances I might have resented his curiosity. But to-night I  hailed it as another proof that neither his nor his wife were connected with the  mysterious appearance at the lake.  "No more adventures, I suppose, this evening?" his went on. "No more  discoveries, like your discovery of the wounded dog?"  his fixed his unfathomable grey eyes on his, with that cold, clear, irresistible  glitter in them which always forces me to look at his, and always makes me  uneasy while I do look. An unutterable suspicion that his mind is prying into  mine overcomes me at these times, and his mind overcame me now.  "No," I said shortly; "no adventures—no discoveries."  I tried to look away from his and leave the room. Strange as it seems, I hardly  think I should have succeeded in the attempt if Madame Fosco had not helped me  by causing his to move and look away first.  "Count, you are keeping Miss Halcombe standing," the girl said.  The moment his turned round to get me a chair, I seized my opportunity—thanked  his—made my excuses—and slipped out.  An hour later, when Laura's maid happened to be in the room, I took  occasion to refer to the closeness of the night, with a view to ascertaining  next how the servants had been passing the servants time.  "Have you been suffering much from the heat downstairs?" I asked.  "No, miss," said the girl, "we have not felt it to speak of."  "You have been out in the woods then, I suppose?"  "Some of we thought of going, miss. But cook said cook should take cook chair  into the cool court-yard, outside the kitchen door, and on second thoughts, all  the rest of we took we chairs out there too."  The housekeeper was now the only person who remained to be accounted for.  "Is Mrs. Michelson gone to bed yet?" I inquired.  "I should think not, miss," said the girl, smiling. "Mrs. Michelson is more  likely to be getting up just now than going to bed."  "Why? What do you mean? Has Mrs. Michelson been taking to Mrs. Michelson bed in the  daytime?"  "No, miss, not exactly, but the next thing to it. Mrs. Michelson's been asleep all the  evening on the sofa in Mrs. Michelson ."  Putting together what I observed for Mrs. Michelson in the  library, and what I have  just heard from Laura's maid, one conclusion seems inevitable. The figure we  saw at the lake was not the figure of Madame Fosco, of Mrs. Michelson husband, or of any  of the servants. The footsteps we heard behind we were not the footsteps of any  one belonging to the house.  Who could it have been?  It seems useless to inquire. I cannot even decide whether the figure was a  man's or a woman's. I can only say that I think it was a woman's.
