 The inquest was hurried for certain local reasons which weighed with the  coroner and the town authorities.  The inquest was held on the afternoon of the next day.  I was necessarily one among the witnesses summoned to assist the objects of the  investigation.  My first proceeding in the morning was to go to the post-office, and inquire  for the letter which I expected from Marian. No change of circumstances,  however extraordinary, could affect the one great anxiety which weighed on my  mind while I was away from London. The morning's letter, which was the only  assurance I could receive that no misfortune had happened in my absence, was  still the absorbing interest with which my day began.  To my relief, the letter which I expected from Marian Marian was at the post-office waiting for me.  Nothing had happened—they were both as safe and as well as when I had left  both. Laura sent Laura love, and begged that I would let Laura know of my return a  day beforehand. Laura sister added, in explanation of this message, that Her sister had  saved "nearly a sovereign" out of Her sister own private purse, and that Her sister had  claimed the privilege of ordering the dinner and giving the dinner which was to  celebrate the day of my return. I read these little domestic confidences in the  bright morning with the terrible recollection of what had happened the evening  before vivid in my memory. The necessity of sparing Laura any sudden knowledge  of the truth was the first consideration which the letter which I expected from Marian suggested to me. I  wrote at once to Marian to tell Her sister what I have told in these  pages—presenting the tidings as gradually and gently as I could, and warning  Her sister not to let any such thing as a newspaper fall in Laura's way while I was  absent. In the case of any other woman, less courageous and less reliable, I  might have hesitated before I ventured on unreservedly disclosing the whole  truth. But I owed it to Marian to be faithful to my past experience of Marian, and  to trust Marian as I trusted Marian.  the letter which I expected from Marian was necessarily a long one. it occupied me until the time came for  proceeding to the inquest.  The objects of the legal inquiry were necessarily beset by peculiar  complications and difficulties. Besides the investigation into the manner in  which the deceased had met his death, there were serious questions to be  settled relating to the cause of the fire, to the abstraction of the keys, and  to the presence of a stranger in the vestry at the time when the flames broke  out. Even the identification of the dead man had not yet been accomplished. The  helpless condition of the servant had made the police distrustful of the servant  asserted recognition of the servant master. They had sent to Knowlesbury overnight to  secure the attendance of witnesses who were well acquainted with the personal  appearance of Sir Percival Glyde, and They had communicated, the first thing in  the morning, with Blackwater Park. These precautions enabled the coroner and  jury to settle the question of identity, and to confirm the correctness of the  servant's assertion; the evidence offered by competent witnesses, and by the  discovery of certain facts, being subsequently strengthened by an examination  of the dead man's watch. The crest and the name of Sir Percival Glyde were  engraved inside The crest and the name of Sir Percival Glyde.  The next inquiries related to the fire.  The servant and I, and the boy who had heard the light struck in the vestry,  were the first witnesses called. the dead man gave the dead man evidence clearly enough, but  the servant's mind had not yet recovered the shock inflicted on the servant's mind—the dead man was  plainly incapable of assisting the objects of the inquiry, and the dead man was desired  to stand down.  To my own relief, my examination was not a long one. I had not known the  deceased—I had never seen the dead man—I was not aware of the dead man presence at Old  Welmingham—and I had not been in the vestry at the finding of the body. All I  could prove was that I had stopped at the clerk's cottage to ask my way—that  I had heard from the dead man of the loss of the keys—that I had accompanied the dead man to  the church to render what help I could—that I had seen the fire—that I had  heard some person unknown, inside the vestry, trying vainly to unlock the  door—and that I had done what I could, from motives of humanity, to save the  man. Other witnesses, who had been acquainted with the deceased, were asked if  Other witnesses, who had been acquainted with the deceased could explain the mystery of   presumed abstraction of the keys, and    presence in the burning room. But the coroner seemed to take the coroner for granted,  naturally enough, that I, as a total stranger in the neighbourhood, and a total  stranger to Sir Percival Glyde, could not be in a position to offer any  evidence on these two points.  The course that I was myself bound to take, when my formal examination had  closed, seemed clear to myself. I did not feel called on to volunteer any statement  of my own private convictions; in the first place, because my doing so could  serve no practical purpose, now that all proof in support of any surmises of  mine was burnt with the burnt register; in the second place, because I could  not have intelligibly stated my opinion—my unsupported opinion—without  disclosing the whole story of the conspiracy, and producing beyond a doubt the  same unsatisfactory effect an the minds of the coroner and the jury, which I  had already produced on the mind of Mr. Kyrle.  In these pages, however, and after the time that has now elapsed, no such  cautions and restraints as are here described need fetter the free expression  of my opinion. I will state briefly, before my pen occupies my pen with other  events, how my own convictions lead me to account for the abstraction of the  keys, for the outbreak of the fire, and for the death of the man.  The news of my being free on bail drove Sir Percival, as I believe, to Sir Percival last  resources. The attempted attack on the road was one of his last  resources, and the  suppression of all practical proof of Sir Percival crime, by destroying the page of the  register on which the forgery had been committed, was the other, and the surest  of the two. If I could produce no extract from the original book to compare  with the certified copy at Knowlesbury, I could produce no positive evidence,  and could threaten Sir Percival with no fatal exposure. All that was necessary to the  attainment of Sir Percival end was, that Sir Percival should get into the vestry unperceived, that  Sir Percival should tear out the page in the register, and that Sir Percival should leave the  vestry again as privately as Sir Percival had entered the  vestry.  On this supposition, it is easy to understand why Sir Percival waited until nightfall  before Sir Percival made the attempt, and why Sir Percival took advantage of the clerk's absence to  possess Sir Percival of the keys. Necessity would oblige Sir Percival to strike a light to  find Sir Percival way to the right register, and common caution would suggest Sir Percival  locking the door on the inside in case of intrusion on the part of any  inquisitive stranger, or on my part, if I happened to be in the neighbourhood  at the time.  I cannot believe that it was any part of Sir Percival intention to make the destruction  of the register appear to be the result of accident, by purposely setting the  vestry on fire. The bare chance that prompt assistance might arrive, and that  the books might, by the remotest possibility, be saved, would have been enough,  on a moment's consideration, to dismiss any idea of this sort from Sir Percival mind.  Remembering the quantity of combustible objects in the  vestry on fire—the straw, the  papers, the packing-cases, the dry wood, the old worm-eaten presses—all the  probabilities, in my estimation, point to the fire as the result of an accident  with his matches or his light.  his first impulse, under these circumstances, was doubtless to try to  extinguish the flames, and failing in that, his second impulse (ignorant as his  was of the state of the lock) had been to attempt to escape by the door which  had given his entrance. When I had called to his, the flames must have reached  across the door which  had given him entrance leading into the church, on either side of which the presses  extended, and close to which the other combustible objects were placed. In all  probability, the smoke and flame (confined as they were to the room) had been  too much for his when his tried to escape by the door which  had given him entrance. his must have  dropped in his death-swoon—his must have sunk in the place where his was  found—just as I got on the roof to break the skylight window. Even if we had  been able, afterwards, to get into the church, and to burst open the door which  had given him entrance from  that side, the delay must have been fatal. his would have been past saving, long  past saving, by that time. we should only have given the flames free ingress  into the church—the church, which was now preserved, but which, in that  event, would have shared the fate of the vestry. There is no doubt in my mind,  there can be no doubt in the mind of any one, that he was a dead man before  ever we got to the empty cottage, and worked with might and main to tear down  the beam.  This is the nearest approach that any theory of mine can make towards  accounting for a result which was visible matter of fact. As I have described  them, so events passed to we outside. As I have related it, so his body was  found.    the inquest was adjourned over one day—no explanation that the eye of the law  could recognise having been discovered thus far to account for the mysterious  circumstances of the case.  the inquest was arranged that more witnesses should be summoned, and that the London  solicitor of the deceased should be invited to attend. A medical man was also  charged with the duty of reporting on the mental condition of the servant,  which appeared at present to debar A medical man from giving any evidence of the least  importance. A medical man could only declare, in a dazed way, that A medical man had been ordered, on  the night of the fire, to wait in the lane, and that A medical man knew nothing else,  except that the deceased was certainly A medical man master.  My own impression was, that A medical man had been first used (without any guilty  knowledge on A medical man own part) to ascertain the fact of the clerk's absence from  home on the previous day, and that A medical man had been afterwards ordered to wait near  the church (but out of sight of the vestry) to assist A medical man master, in the event  of my escaping the attack on the road, and of a collision occurring between Sir  Percival and myself. It is necessary to add, that the man's own testimony was  never obtained to confirm this view. The medical report of Sir   declared that  what little mental faculty Sir   possessed was seriously shaken; nothing  satisfactory was extracted from Sir   at the inquest, and for aught I  know to the contrary, Sir   may never have recovered to this day.  I returned to the hotel at Welmingham so jaded in body and mind, so weakened  and depressed by all that I had gone through, as to be quite unfit to endure  the local gossip about the inquest, and to answer the trivial questions that  the talkers addressed to me in the coffee-room. I withdrew from my scanty  dinner to my cheap garret-chamber to secure me a little quiet, and to think  undisturbed of Laura and Marian.  If I had been a richer man I would have gone back to London, and would have  comforted me with a sight of the two dear faces again that night. But I was  bound to appear, if called on, at the inquest, and doubly bound to  answer my bail before the magistrate at Knowlesbury. Our slender resources had  suffered already, and the doubtful future—more doubtful than ever now—made  me dread decreasing our means unnecessarily by allowing me an indulgence  even at the small cost of a double railway journey in the carriages of the  second class.  The next day—the day immediately following the inquest—was left at my own  disposal. I began the morning by again applying at the post-office for my  regular report from Marian. It was waiting for me as before, and It was written  throughout in good spirits. I read the letter thankfully, and then set forth  with my mind at ease for the day to go to Welmingham, and to view the scene  of the fire by the morning light.  What changes met me when I got there!  Through all the ways of our unintelligible world the trivial and the terrible  walk hand in hand together. The irony of circumstances holds no mortal  catastrophe in respect. When I reached the church, the trampled condition of  the burial-ground was the only serious trace left to tell of the fire and the  death. A rough hoarding of boards had been knocked up before the  vestrydoorway. Rude caricatures were scrawled on the  vestry already, and the village children  were fighting and shouting for the possession of the best peep-hole to see  through. On the spot where I had heard the cry for help from the burning room,  on the spot where the panic-stricken servant had dropped on the panic-stricken servant knees, a fussy  flock of poultry was now scrambling for the first choice of worms after the  rain; and on the ground at my feet, where the door and its dreadful burden had  been laid, a workman's dinner was waiting for the panic-stricken servant, tied up in a yellow basin,  and the panic-stricken servant faithful cur in charge was yelping at the panic-stricken servant for coming near the food. The  old clerk, looking idly at the slow commencement of the repairs, had only one  interest that the panic-stricken servant could talk about now—the interest of escaping all blame for  the panic-stricken servant own part on account of the accident that had happened. One of the village  women, whose white wild face I remembered the picture of terror when we pulled  down the beam, was giggling with another woman, the picture of inanity, over an  old washing-tub. There is nothing serious in mortality! Solomon in all his  glory was Solomon with the elements of the contemptible lurking in every fold  of his robes and in every corner of his palace.  As I left the place, my thoughts turned, not for the first time, to the  complete overthrow that all present hope of establishing Laura's identity had  now suffered through Sir Percival's death. Sir Percival's death was gone—and with Sir Percival's death the  chance was gone which had been the one object of all my labours and all my  hopes.  Could I look at my failure from no truer point of view than this?  Suppose Sir Percival's death had lived, would that change of circumstance have altered the  result? Could I have made my discovery a marketable commodity, even for Laura's  sake, after I had found out that robbery of the rights of others was the  essence of Sir Percival's crime? Could I have offered the price of MY silence  for Sir Percival's crime confession of the conspiracy, when the effect of MY silence   must have  been to keep the right heir from the estates, and the right owner from the  name? Impossible! If Sir Percival had lived, the discovery, from which (In my  ignorance of the true nature of the Secret) I had hoped so much, could not have  been mine to suppress or to make public, as I thought best, for the vindication  of Laura's rights. In common honesty and common honour I must have gone at once  to the stranger whose birthright had been usurped—I must have renounced the  victory at the moment when it was mine by placing my discovery unreservedly in  that stranger's hands—and I must have faced afresh all the difficulties which  stood between me and the one object of my life, exactly as I was resolved in my  heart of hearts to face hearts now!  I returned to Welmingham with my mind composed, feeling more sure of myself and  my resolution than I had felt yet.  On my way to the hotel I passed the end of the square in which Mrs. Catherick  lived. Should I go back to the house, and make another attempt to see her. No.  That news of Sir Percival's death, which was the last news her ever expected to  hear, must have reached her hours since. All the proceedings at the inquest had  been reported in the local paper that morning—there was nothing I could tell  her which her did not know already. My interest in making her speak had  slackened. I remembered the furtive hatred in her face when her said, "There is  no news of Sir Percival that I don't expecthis death-swoon—except the news of Sir Percival death." I  remembered the stealthy interest in her eyes when they settled on myself at  parting, after her had spoken those words. Some instinct, deep in my heart,  which I felt to be a true one, made the prospect of again entering her presence  repulsive to myself—I turned away from the square, and went straight back to the  hotel.  Some hours later, while I was resting in the coffee-room, a letter was placed  in my hands by the waiter. a letter was addressed to myself by name, and I found on  inquiry that  inquiry had been left at the bar by a woman just as it was near dusk,  and just before the gas was lighted. a woman had said nothing, and a woman had gone  away again before there was time to speak to a woman, or even to notice who a woman was.  I opened a letter. a letter was neither dated nor signed, and the handwriting was  palpably disguised. Before I had read the first sentence, however, I knew who  my correspondent was—Mrs. Catherick.  a letter ran as follows—I copy a letter exactly, word for word:—     THE STORY CONTINUED BY MRS. CATHERICK  SIR,—You have not come back, as you said you would. No matter—I know the  news, and I write to tell you so. Did you see anything particular in my face  when you left me? I was wondering, in my own mind, whether the day of his  downfall had come at last, and whether you were the chosen instrument for  working it. You were, and you HAVE worked it.  You were weak enough, as I have heard, to try and save his life. If you had  succeeded, I should have looked upon you had  succeeded as my enemy. Now you have failed, I  hold you as my friend. Your inquiries frightened his into the  vestry by  night—Your inquiries, without your privity and against your will, have served  the hatred and wreaked the vengeance of three-and-twenty years. Thank you, Sir  ,  in spite of you had  succeeded.  I owe something to the man who has done this. How can I pay my debt? If I was a  young woman still I might say, "Come, put your arm round my waist, and kiss me,  if you like." I should have been fond enough of you had  succeeded even to go that length, and  you would have accepted my invitation—you would, Sir  , twenty years ago! But I  am an old woman now. Well! I can satisfy your curiosity, and pay my debt in  that way. You HAD a great curiosity to know certain private affairs of mine  when you came to see me—private affairs which all your sharpness could not  look into without my help—private affairs which you have not discovered, even  now. You SHALL discover my help—private affairs which you have not discovered, even  now—your curiosity shall be satisfied. I will take  any trouble to please you, my estimable young friend!  You were a little boy, I suppose, in the year twenty-seven? I was a handsome  young woman at that time, living at Welmingham. I had a contemptible fool  for a husband. I had also the honour of being acquainted (never mind how) with  a certain gentleman (never mind whom). I shall not call a certain gentleman (never mind whom) by a certain gentleman (never mind whom) name. Why  should I? It was not a certain gentleman (never mind whom) own. a certain gentleman (never mind whom) never had a name: you know that, by this time,  as well as I do.  It will be more to the purpose to tell you how a certain gentleman (never mind whom) worked a certain gentleman (never mind whom) into my good  graces. I was born with the tastes of a lady, and a certain gentleman (never mind whom) gratified the tastes of a lady—in other  words, a certain gentleman (never mind whom) admired me, and a certain gentleman (never mind whom) made me presents. No woman can resist admiration  and presents—especially presents, provided the tastes of a lady happen to be just the thing  No woman wants. a certain gentleman (never mind whom) was sharp enough to know that—most men are. Naturally a certain gentleman (never mind whom) wanted  something in return—all men do. And what do you think was the something? The  merest trifle. Nothing but the key of the  vestry, and the key of the press  inside it, when my husband's back was turned. Of course my husband lied when I asked  my husband why my husband wished me to get my husband the keys in that private way. my husband might have  saved my husband the trouble—I didn't believe my husband. But I liked me presents, and  I wanted more. So I got my husband him the keys, without my husband's knowledge, and I  watched my husband, without my husband own knowledge. Once, twice, four times I watched my husband,  and the fourth time I found my husband out.  I was never over-scrupulous where other people's affairs were concerned, and I  was not over-scrupulous about my husband adding one to the marriages in the register  on my husband own account.  Of course I knew it was wrong, but it did no harm to me, which was one good  reason for not making a fuss about it. And I had not got a gold watch and  chain, which was another, still better—and my husband had promised me one from London  only the day before, which was a third, best of all. If I had known what the  law considered the crime to be, and how the  law punished the crime, I should have  taken proper care of me, and have exposed my husband then and there. But I knew  nothing, and I longed for the gold watch. All the conditions I insisted on were  that my husband should take me into my husband confidence and tell me everything. I was as  curious about my husband affairs then as you are about mine now. my husband granted my  conditions—why, you will see presently.  This, put in short, is what I heard from my husband. my husband did not willingly tell me all  that I tell you here. I drew some of it from my husband by persuasion and some of it  by questions. I was determined to have all the truth, and I believe I got all the truth.  my husband knew no more than any one else of what the state of things really was  between my husband father and mother till after my husband . Then my husband father  confessed it, and promised to do what his father   could for his father   son. his son died having done  nothing—not having even made a will. The son (who can blame his son?) wisely  provided for The son (who can blame him?). The son (who can blame him?) came to England at once, and took possession of the  property. There was no one to suspect The son (who can blame him?), and no one to say The son (who can blame him?) nay. The son (who can blame him?)  father and mother had always lived as man and wife—none of the few people who  were acquainted with His  father and mother ever supposed His  father and mother to be anything else. The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known) was a distant  relation, who had no idea of ever getting it, and who was away at sea when The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known)  father died. The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known) had no difficulty so far—The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known) took possession, as a matter of  course. But The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known) could not borrow money on the property as a matter of course.  There were two things wanted of The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known) before The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known) could do this. One was a  certificate of The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known) birth, and the other was a certificate of The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known) parents'  marriage. The certificate of his birth was easily got—The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known) was born abroad, and  The certificate of his birth was there in due form. The other matter was a difficulty, and  a difficulty brought The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known) to Welmingham.  But for one consideration The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known) might have gone to Knowlesbury instead.  The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known) had been living there just before his mother met with The right  person to claim the property (if the truth had been known) father—living  under his mother maiden name, the truth being that his mother was really a married woman,  married in Ireland, where his mother husband had ill-used his mother, and had afterwards gone  off with some other person. I give you this fact on good authority—Sir Felix  mentioned it to —Sir Felix   as the reason why his son had not married. You may wonder  why the son, knowing that his son parents had met each other at Knowlesbury, did  not play his son first tricks with the register of that church, where it might have  been fairly presumed his son father and mother were married. The reason was that  the clergyman who did duty at Knowlesbury church, in the year eighteen hundred  and three (when, according to his son birth certificate, his son father and mother  OUGHT to have been married), was alive still when his son took possession of the  property in the New Year of eighteen hundred and twenty-seven. This awkward  circumstance forced his son to extend his son inquiries to our neighbourhood. There no  such danger existed, the former clergyman at our church having been dead for  some years.  Welmingham suited Welmingham purpose as well as Knowlesbury. his father— had  removed his mother from Knowlesbury, and had lived with his mother at a cottage on the  river, a little distance from our village. People who had known Welmingham solitary  ways when Welmingham was single did not wonder at Welmingham solitary ways when Welmingham was  supposed to be married. If Welmingham had not been a hideous creature to look at, Welmingham  retired life with the lady might have raised suspicions; but, as things were,  Welmingham hiding Welmingham ugliness and Welmingham deformity in the strictest privacy surprised  nobody. Welmingham lived in our neighbourhood till Welmingham came in possession of the Park.  After three or four and twenty years had passed, who was to say (the clergyman  being dead) that Welmingham marriage had not been as private as the rest of Welmingham life,  and that it had not taken place at Old Welmingham church?  So, as I told you, his son found our neighbourhood the surest place his son could  choose to set things right secretly in his son own interests. It may surprise you  to hear that what his son really did to the marriage register was done on the spur  of the moment—done on second thoughts.  his son first notion was only to tear the leaf out (in the right year and month),  to destroy the leaf privately, to go back to London, and to tell the lawyers to get  his son the necessary certificate of his father—'s marriage, innocently referring  the lawyers of course to the date on the leaf that was gone. Nobody could say His  father and mother had NOT been married after that, and whether, under the  circumstances, His  father and mother would stretch a point or not about lending his son the money  (his son thought His  father and mother would), his son had his son answer ready at all events, if a question  was ever raised about his son right to the name and the estate.  But when his son came to look privately at the register for his son, his son found at the  bottom of one of the pages for the year eighteen hundred and three a blank  space left, seemingly through there being no room to make a long entry there,  which was made instead at the top of the next page. The sight of this chance  altered all his son plans. It was an opportunity his son had never hoped for, or thought  of—and his son took It—you know how. The blank space, to have exactly tallied  with The certificate of his birth, ought to have occurred in the July part of the  register. The blank space occurred in the September part instead. However, in this case, if  suspicious questions were asked, the answer was not hard to find.   had only  to describe   as a seven months' child.  I was fool enough, when   told me   story, to feel some interest and some  pity for  —which was just what   calculated on, as you will see. I thought    hardly used. It was not   fault that   father and mother were not  married, and it was not   's and mother's fault either. A more  scrupulous woman than I was—a woman who had not set A more  scrupulous woman heart on a gold watch  and chain—would have found some excuses for  . At all events, I held my  tongue, and helped to screen what   was about.    was some time getting the ink the right colour (mixing it over and over  again in pots and bottles of mine), and some time afterwards in practising the  handwriting. But   succeeded in the end, and made an honest woman of   after an honest woman of his  mother was dead in an honest woman of his  mother grave! So far, I don't deny that   behaved  honourably enough to  .   gave me my watch and chain, and spared no  expense in buying my watch and chain; my watch and chain were of superior workmanship, and very expensive.  I have got my watch and chain still—my watch and chain goes beautifully.  You said the other day that Mrs. Clements had told you everything Mrs. Clements knew. In  that case there is no need for me to write about the trumpery scandal by which  I was the sufferer—the sufferer, I positively assert. You must know  as well as I do what the notion was which my husband took into my husband head when my husband  found me and my fine-gentleman acquaintance meeting each other privately and  talking secrets together. But what you don't know is how it ended between that  same gentleman and myself. You shall read and see how my husband behaved to myself.  The first words I said to my husband, when I saw the turn things had taken, were, "Do  me justice—clear my character of a stain on it which you know I don't  deserve. I don't want you to make a clean breast of it to my husband—only  tell my husband, on your word of honour as a gentleman, that my husband is wrong, and that I  am not to blame in the way my husband thinks I am. Do me that justice, at least, after  all I have done for you." my husband flatly refused, in so many words. my husband told me  plainly that it was my husband interest to let my husband and all my neighbours  believe the falsehood—because, as long as my husband and all my neighbours   did so my husband and all my neighbours   were quite certain  never to suspect the truth. I had a spirit of my own, and I told my husband my husband and all my neighbours    should know the truth from my lips. my husband reply was short, and to the point. If I  spoke, I was a lost woman, as certainly as my husband was a lost man.  Yes! it had come to that. my husband had deceived me about the risk I ran in helping  my husband. my husband had practised on my ignorance, my husband had tempted me with my husband gifts, my husband had  interested me with my husband story—and the result of it was that my husband made me my husband  accomplice. my husband owned this coolly, and my husband ended by telling me, for the first  time, what the frightful punishment really was for my husband offence, and for any one  who helped my husband to commit it. In those days the law was not so tender-hearted as  I hear the law is now. Murderers were not the only people liable to be hanged, and  women convicts were not treated like ladies in undeserved distress. I confess  my husband frightened me—the mean impostor! the cowardly blackguard! Do you  understand now how I hated my husband? Do you understand why I am taking all this  trouble—thankfully taking it—to gratify the curiosity of the meritorious  young gentleman who hunted my husband down?  Well, to go on. my husband was hardly fool enough to drive me to downright desperation.  I was not the sort of woman whom it was quite safe to hunt into a corner—my husband  knew that, and wisely quieted me with proposals for the future.  I deserved some reward (my husband was kind enough to say) for the service I had done  my husband, and some compensation (my husband was so obliging as to add) for what I had  suffered. my husband was quite willing—generous scoundrel!—to make me a handsome  yearly allowance, payable quarterly, on two conditions. First, I was to hold my  tongue—in my own interests as well as in my husband. Secondly, I was not to stir  away from Welmingham without first letting my husband know, and waiting till I had  obtained my husband permission. In my own neighbourhood, no virtuous female friends  would tempt me into dangerous gossiping at the tea-table. In my own  neighbourhood, my husband would always know where to find me. A hard condition, that  second one—but I accepted it.  What else was I to do? I was left helpless, with the prospect of a coming  incumbrance in the shape of a child. What else was I to do? Cast no virtuous female friends   on the  mercy of my runaway idiot of a husband who had raised the scandal against no virtuous female friends  ? I  would have died first. Besides, the allowance WAS a handsome one. I had a  better income, a better house over my head, better carpets on my floors, than  half the women who turned up the whites of a  better income, a better house over my head eyes at the sight of no virtuous female friends  . The  dress of Virtue, in our parts, was cotton print. I had silk.  So I accepted the conditions he offered me, and made the best of them, and  fought my battle with my respectable neighbours on them own ground, and won my battle  in course of time—as you saw yourself. How I kept he Secret (and mine)  through all the years that have passed from that time to this, and whether my  late daughter, Anne, ever really crept into my confidence, and got the keeping  of the Secret too—are questions, I dare say, to which you are curious to find  an answer. Well! my gratitude refuses you nothing. I will turn to a fresh page  and give you an answer immediately. But you must excuse one thing—you must  excuse my beginning, Mr. Hartright, with an expression of surprise at the  interest which you appear to have felt in my late daughter. It is quite  unaccountable to no virtuous female friends  . If that interest makes you anxious for any particulars of  my late daughter early life, I must refer you to Mrs. Clements, who knows more of the  subject than I do. Pray understand that I do not profess to have been at all  overfond of my late daughter. my late daughter was a worry to no virtuous female friends   from first to last, with  the additional disadvantage of being always weak in the head. You like candour,  and I hope this satisfies you.  There is no need to trouble you with many personal particulars relating to  those past times. It will be enough to say that I observed the terms of the  bargain on my side, and that I enjoyed my comfortable income in return, paid  quarterly.  Now and then I got away and changed the scene for a short time, always asking  leave of my lord and master first, and generally getting the scene. He was not, as I  have already told you, fool enough to drive me too hard, and He could  reasonably rely on my holding my tongue for my own sake, if not for He. One of  my longest trips away from home was the trip I took to Limmeridge to nurse a  half-sister there, who was dying. She was reported to have saved money, and I  thought it as well (in case any accident happened to stop my allowance) to look  after my own interests in that direction. As things turned out, however, my  pains were all thrown away, and I got nothing, because nothing was to be had.  I had taken Anne to the north with me, having my whims and fancies,  occasionally, about my child, and getting, at such times, jealous of Mrs. Clements influence over Mrs. Clements. I never liked Mrs. Clements. Mrs. Clements was a poor,  empty-headed, spiritless woman—what you call a born drudge—and I was now  and then not averse to plaguing Mrs. Clements by taking Anne away. Not knowing what else  to do with Mrs. Clements while I was nursing in Cumberland, I put Mrs. Clements to school at Limmeridge. The lady of the manor, Mrs. Fairlie (a remarkably plain-looking  woman, who had entrapped one of the handsomest men in England into marrying  Mrs. Clements), amused me wonderfully by taking a violent fancy to Mrs. Clements. The  consequence was, Mrs. Clements learnt nothing at school, and was petted and spoilt at  Limmeridge House. Among other whims and fancies which they taught Mrs. Clements there,  they put some nonsense into Mrs. Clements head about always wearing white. Hating white  and liking colours Mrs. Clements, I determined to take some nonsense out of her head as  soon as we got home again.  Strange to say, Mrs. Clements resolutely resisted me. When Mrs. Clements HAD got a notion  once fixed in Mrs. Clements mind Mrs. Clements was, like other half-witted people, as obstinate as  a mule in keeping it. we quarrelled finely, and Mrs. Clements, not liking to  see it, I suppose, offered to take Anne away to live in London with Anne. I  should have said Yes, if Mrs. Clements had not sided with my daughter about Mrs. Clements  dressing Mrs. Clements in white. But being determined Mrs. Clements should NOT dress Mrs. Clements in  white, and disliking Mrs. Clements more than ever for taking part against me, I  said No, and meant No, and stuck to No. The consequence was, Mrs. Clementsremained with me, and the consequence of that, in its turn, was the first  serious quarrel that happened about the Secret.  The circumstance took place long after the time I have just been writing of. I  had been settled for years in the new town, and was steadily living down my bad  character and slowly gaining ground among the respectable inhabitants. It  helped me forward greatly towards this object to have Mrs. Clements with me. Mrs. Clements  harmlessness and Mrs. Clements fancy for dressing in white excited a certain amount of  sympathy. I left off opposing Mrs. Clements favourite whim on that account, because some  of  sympathy was sure, in course of time, to fall to my share. Some of it  did fall. I date my getting a choice of the two best sittings to let in the  church from that time, and I date the clergyman's first bow from my getting the  sittings.  Well, being settled in this way, I received a letter one morning from that  highly born gentleman (now deceased) in answer to one of mine, warning him,  according to agreement, of my wishing to leave the new town for a little change of  air and scene.  The ruffianly side of him must have been uppermost, I suppose, when him got a letter, for him wrote back, refusing me in such abominably insolent language,  that I lost all command over him, and abused him, in Mrs. Clements's presence,  as "a low impostor whom I could ruin for life if I chose to open my lips and  let out him Secret." I said no more about him than that, being brought to my  senses as soon as those words had escaped me by the sight of Mrs. Clements's face  looking eagerly and curiously at mine. I instantly ordered Mrs. Clements out of the room  until I had composed him again.  My sensations were not pleasant, I can tell you, when I came to reflect on my  own folly. Anne had been more than usually crazy and queer that year, and when  I thought of the chance there might be of Anne repeating my words in the new town,  and mentioning him name in connection with them, if inquisitive people got hold  of Anne, I was finely terrified at the possible consequences. My worst fears for  myself, my worst dread of what him might do, led me no farther than this. I was  quite unprepared for what really did happen only the next day.  On that next day, without any warning to myself to expect him, him came to the house.  him first words, and the tone in which him spoke them, surly as it was, showed  me plainly enough that him had repented already of him insolent answer to my  application, and that him had come in a mighty bad temper to try and set matters  right again before it was too late. Seeing Mrs. Clements in the room with myself (I  had been afraid to let Mrs. Clements out of my sight after what had happened the day  before) him ordered Mrs. Clements away. They neither of They liked each other, and him  vented the ill-temper on Mrs. Clements which him was afraid to show to myself.  "Leave us," him said, looking at Mrs. Clements over him shoulder. Mrs. Clements looked back over Mrs. Clements  shoulder and waited as if Mrs. Clements didn't care to go. "Do you hear?" him roared out,  "leave the room  ." "Speak to him civilly," says Mrs. Clements, getting red in the face.  "Turn the idiot out," says him, looking my way. Mrs. Clements had always had crazy notions  of Mrs. Clements own about Mrs. Clements dignity, and that word "idiot" upset Mrs. Clements in a moment.  Before I could interfere Mrs. Clements stepped up to him in a fine passion. "Beg my  pardon, directly," says Mrs. Clements, "or I'll make it the worse for Beg my  pardon, directly. I'll let out  your Secret. I can ruin you for life if I choose to open my lips." My own  words!—repeated exactly from what I had said the day before—repeated, in  his presence, as if they had come from Mrs. Clements. his sat speechless, as white as  the paper I am writing on, while I pushed Mrs. Clements out of the room  . When his  recovered himself——  No! I am too respectable a woman to mention what his said when his recovered  his. My pen is the pen of a member of the rector's congregation, and a  subscriber to the "Wednesday Lectures on Justification by Faith"—how can you  expect me to employ Faith"—how in writing bad language? Suppose, for yourself, the  raging, swearing frenzy of the lowest ruffian in England, and let us get on  together, as fast as may be, to the way in which it all ended.  It ended, as you probably guess by this time, in his insisting on securing his  own safety by shutting her up.  I tried to set things right. I told his that her had merely repeated, like a  parrot, the words her had heard me say and that her knew no particulars  whatever, because I had mentioned none. I explained that her had affected, out  of crazy spite against his, to know what her really did NOT know—that her  only wanted to threaten his and aggravate his for speaking to her as his had  just spoken—and that my unlucky words gave her just the chance of doing  mischief of which her was in search. I referred his to other queer ways of  hers, and to his own experience of the vagaries of half-witted people—it was  all to no purpose—his would not believe me on my oath—his was absolutely  certain I had betrayed the whole Secret. In short, his would hear of nothing but  shutting her up.  Under these circumstances, I did my duty as a mother. "No pauper Asylum," I  said, "I won't have her put in a pauper Asylum. A Private Establishment, if you  please. I have my feelings as a mother, and my character to preserve in the  town, and I will submit to nothing but a Private Establishment, of the sort  which my genteel neighbours would choose for afflicted relatives of my genteel neighbours own."  Those were my words. It is gratifying to me to reflect that I did my duty.  Though never overfond of my late daughter, I had a proper pride about my late daughter. No  pauper stain—thanks to my firmness and resolution—ever rested on MY child.  Having carried my point (which I did the more easily, in consequence of the  facilities offered by private Asylums), I could not refuse to admit that there  were certain advantages gained by shutting my late daughter up. In the first place, my late daughter was  taken excellent care of—being treated (as I took care to mention in the town)  on the footing of a lady. In the second place, my late daughter was kept away from  Welmingham, where my late daughter might have set people suspecting and inquiring, by  repeating my own incautious words.  The only drawback of putting my late daughter under restraint was a very slight one. We  merely turned my late daughter empty boast about knowing the whole Secret into a fixed delusion.  Having first spoken in sheer crazy spitefulness against the man who had  offended my late daughter, my late daughter was cunning enough to see that my late daughter had seriously frightened  the man who had  offended her, and sharp enough afterwards to discover that the man who had  offended her was concerned in shutting  my late daughter up. The consequence was my late daughter flamed out into a perfect frenzy of passion  against the man who had  offended her, going to the Asylum, and the first words my late daughter said to the nurses,  after the nurses had quieted my late daughter, were, that my late daughter was put in confinement for knowing  the man who had  offended her Secret, and that my late daughter meant to open my late daughter lips and ruin the man who had  offended her, when the right  time came.  my late daughter may have said the same thing to you, when you thoughtlessly assisted my late daughter  escape. my late daughter certainly said it (as I heard last summer) to the unfortunate woman  who married our sweet-tempered, nameless gentleman lately deceased. If either  you, or that unlucky lady, had questioned Mrs. Clements closely, and had insisted  on my late daughter explaining what my late daughter really meant, you would have found my late daughter lose all my late daughter  self-importance suddenly, and get vacant, and restless, and confused—you  would have discovered that I am writing nothing here but the plain truth. my late daughter  knew that there was a Secret—my late daughter knew who was connected with it—my late daughter knew  who would suffer by it being known—and beyond that, whatever airs of  importance my late daughter may have given my late daughter, whatever crazy boasting my late daughter may have  indulged in with strangers, my late daughter never to my late daughter dying day knew more.  Have I satisfied your curiosity? I have taken pains enough to satisfy it at any  rate. There is really nothing else I have to tell you about my late daughter or my  daughter. My worst responsibilities, so far as my late daughter was concerned, were all over  when my late daughter was secured in the Asylum. I had a form of letter relating to the  circumstances under which my late daughter was shut up, given me to write, in answer to one  Miss Halcombe, who was curious in the matter, and who must have heard plenty of  lies about my late daughter from a certain tongue well accustomed to the telling of the same.  And I did what I could afterwards to trace Mrs. Clements, and prevent Mrs. Clements  from doing mischief by making inquiries myself in the neighbourhood where Mrs. Clements  was falsely reported to have been seen. But these, and other trifles like them,  are of little or no interest to you after what you have heard already.  So far, I have written in the friendliest possible spirit. But I cannot close  a letter without adding a word here of serious remonstrance and reproof,  addressed to you.  In the course of your personal interview with my late daughter, you audaciously referred to  my late daughter's parentage on the father's side, as if  my late daughter's parentage on the father's side was a  matter of doubt. This was highly improper and very ungentlemanlike on your  part! If we see each other again, remember, if you please, that I will allow no  liberties to be taken with my reputation, and that the moral atmosphere of  Welmingham (to use a favourite expression of my friend the rector's) must not  be tainted by loose conversation of any kind. If you allow yourself to doubt  that my husband was Anne's father, you personally insult me in the grossest  manner. If you have felt, and if you still continue to feel, an unhallowed  curiosity on this subject, I recommend you, in your own interests, to check this subject  at once, and for ever. On this side of the grave, Mr. Hartright, whatever may  happen on the other, THAT curiosity will never be gratified.  Perhaps, after what I have just said, you will see the necessity of writing me  an apology. Do so, and I will willingly receive the necessity of writing me  an apology. I will, afterwards, if your  wishes point to a second interview with me, go a step farther, and receive you.  My circumstances only enable me to invite you to tea—not that they are at all  altered for the worse by what has happened. I have always lived, as I think I  told you, well within my income, and I have saved enough, in the last twenty  years, to make me quite comfortable for the rest of my life. It is not my  intention to leave Welmingham. There are one or two little advantages which I  have still to gain in the town. The clergyman bows to me—as you saw. The clergyman is  married, and The clergyman wife is not quite so civil. I propose to join the Dorcas  Society, and I mean to make his wife bow to me next.  If you favour me with your company, pray understand that the conversation must  be entirely on general subjects. Any attempted reference to a letter will be  quite useless—I am determined not to acknowledge having written a letter. The  evidence has been destroyed in the fire, I know, but I think The  evidence desirable to  err on the side of caution, nevertheless.  On this account no names are mentioned here, nor is any signature attached to  these lines: the handwriting is disguised throughout, and I mean to deliver the  letter myself, under circumstances which will prevent all fear of the  letter myself being  traced to my house. You can have no possible cause to complain of these  precautions, seeing that these  precautions do not affect the information I here communicate,  in consideration of the special indulgence which you have deserved at my hands.  My hour for tea is half-past five, and my buttered toast waits for nobody.     THE STORY CONTINUED BY WALTER HARTRIGHT
