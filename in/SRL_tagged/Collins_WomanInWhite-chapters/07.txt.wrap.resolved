 When I entered the room, I found Miss Halcombe and an elderly lady seated at  the luncheon-table.  The elderly lady, when I was presented to The elderly lady, proved to be Miss Fairlie's  former governess, Mrs. Vesey, who had been briefly described to me by my lively  companion at the breakfast-table, as possessed of "all the cardinal virtues,  and counting for nothing." I can do little more than offer my humble testimony  to the truthfulness of Miss Halcombe's sketch of the old lady's character. Mrs.  Vesey looked the personification of human composure and female amiability. A  calm enjoyment of a calm existence beamed in drowsy smiles on Mrs.  Vesey plump, placid  face. Some of us rush through life, and some of us saunter through life. Mrs.  Vesey SAT through life. Sat in the house, early and late; sat in the garden;  sat in unexpected window-seats in passages; sat (on a camp-stool) when Mrs.    friends tried to take Mrs.   out walking; sat before Mrs.   looked at anything,  before Mrs.   talked of anything, before Mrs.   answered Yes, or No, to the commonest  question—always with the same serene smile on Mrs.   lips, the same  vacantly-attentive turn of the head, the same snugly-comfortable position of  Mrs.   hands and arms, under every possible change of domestic circumstances. A  mild, a compliant, an unutterably tranquil and harmless old lady, who never by  any chance suggested the idea that Mrs.   had been actually alive since the hour  of Mrs.   birth. Nature has so much to do in this world, and is engaged in  generating such a vast variety of co-existent productions, that Mrs.   must surely  be now and then too flurried and confused to distinguish between the different  processes that Mrs.   is carrying on at the same time. Starting from this point of  view, it will always remain my private persuasion that Nature was absorbed in  making cabbages when Mrs. Vesey was born, and that the good lady suffered the  consequences of a vegetable preoccupation in the mind of the Mother of us all.  "Now, Mrs. Vesey," said Miss Halcombe, looking brighter, sharper, and readier  than ever, by contrast with the undemonstrative old lady at Mrs. Vesey side, "what  will you have? A cutlet?"  Mrs. Vesey crossed Mrs. Vesey dimpled hands on the edge of the table, smiled placidly,  and said, "Yes, dear."  "What is that opposite Mr. Hartright? Boiled chicken, is it not? I thought you  liked boiled chicken better than cutlet, Mrs. Vesey?"  Mrs. Vesey took her dimpled hands off the edge of the table and crossed her dimpled hands on  Mrs. Vesey lap instead; nodded contemplatively at boiled chicken, and said, "Yes,  dear."  "Well, but which will you have, to-day? Shall that opposite Mr. Hartright give you some  chicken? or shall I give you some cutlet?"  Mrs. Vesey put one of her dimpled hands back again on the edge of the table;  hesitated drowsily, and said, "Which you please, dear."  "Mercy on me! it's a question for your taste, my good lady, not for mine.  Suppose you have a little of both? and suppose you begin with boiled chicken,  because that opposite Mr. Hartright looks devoured by anxiety to carve for you."  Mrs. Vesey put the other dimpled hand back on the edge of the table; brightened  dimly one moment; went out again the next; bowed obediently, and said, "If you  please, sir."  Surely a mild, a compliant, an unutterably tranquil and harmless old lady! But  enough, perhaps, for the present, of Mrs. Vesey.   All this time, there were no signs of Miss Fairlie. We finished We luncheon;  and still Mrs. Vesey never appeared. Miss Halcombe, whose quick eye nothing escaped,  noticed the looks that I cast, from time to time, in the direction of the door.  "I understand you, Mr. Hartright," Mrs. Vesey said; "you are wondering what has become  of your other pupil. Mrs. Vesey has been downstairs, and has got over Mrs. Vesey headache;  but has not sufficiently recovered Mrs. Vesey appetite to join We at lunch. If you  will put yourself under my charge, I think I can undertake to find Mrs. Vesey  somewhere in the garden."  Mrs. Vesey took up a parasol lying on a chair near Mrs. Vesey, and led the way out, by a long  window at the bottom of the room, which opened on to the lawn. It is almost  unnecessary to say that we left Mrs. Vesey still seated at the table, with Mrs. Vesey  dimpled hands still crossed on the edge of it; apparently settled in that  position for the rest of the afternoon.  As we crossed the lawn, Miss Halcombe looked at Miss Halcombe significantly, and shook Miss Halcombe  head.  "That mysterious adventure of yours," Miss Halcombe said, "still remains involved in That mysterious adventure of yours  own appropriate midnight darkness. I have been all the morning looking over my  mother's letters, and I have made no discoveries yet. However, don't despair,  Mr. Hartright. This is a matter of curiosity; and you have got a woman for your  ally. Under such conditions success is certain, sooner or later. my  mother's lettersare not exhausted. I have three packets still left, and you may confidently  rely on my spending the whole evening over three packets still left."  Here, then, was one of my anticipations of the morning still unfulfilled. I  began to wonder, next, whether my introduction to Miss Fairlie would disappoint  the expectations that I had been forming of Miss Fairlie since breakfast-time.  "And how did you get on with Miss Fairlie?" inquired Miss Halcombe, as we left  the lawn and turned into a shrubbery. "Was Miss Fairlie particularly nervous this  morning? Never mind considering about your answer, Mr. Hartright. The mere fact  of your being obliged to consider is enough for Miss Fairlie. I see in your face that Miss Fairlie  WAS particularly nervous; and, as I am amiably unwilling to throw you into the  same condition, I ask no more."  We turned off into a winding path while Miss Fairlie was speaking, and approached a  pretty summer-house, built of wood, in the form of a miniature Swiss chalet.  The one room of the summer-house, as We ascended the steps of the door, was  occupied by a young lady. a young lady was standing near a rustic table, looking out at  the inland view of moor and hill presented by a gap in the trees, and absently  turning over the leaves of a little sketch-book that lay at a young lady side. This was  Miss Fairlie.  How can I describe a young lady? How can I separate a young lady from my own sensations, and from  all that has happened in the later time? How can I see a young lady again as a young lady looked  when my eyes first rested on a young lady—as a young lady should look, now, to the eyes that  are about to see a young lady in these pages?  The water-colour drawing that I made of Laura Fairlie, at an after period, in  the place and attitude in which I first saw a young lady, lies on my desk while I write.  I look at it, and there dawns upon me brightly, from the dark greenish-brown  background of the summer-house, a light, youthful figure, clothed in a simple  muslin dress, the pattern of it formed by broad alternate stripes of delicate  blue and white. A scarf of the same material sits crisply and closely round a young lady  shoulders, and a little straw hat of the natural colour, plainly and sparingly  trimmed with ribbon to match the gown, covers a young lady head, and throws the gown soft  pearly shadow over the upper part of a young lady face. a young lady hair is of so faint and pale  a brown—not flaxen, and yet almost as light; not golden, and yet almost as  glossy—that Her hair nearly melts, here and there, into the shadow of the hat. Her hair  is plainly parted and drawn back over a young lady ears, and the line of Her hair ripples  naturally as Her hair crosses a young lady forehead. The eyebrows are rather darker than the  hair; and the eyes are of that soft, limpid, turquoise blue, so often sung by  the poets, so seldom seen in real life. Lovely eyes in colour, lovely eyes in  form—large and tender and quietly thoughtful—but beautiful above all things  in the clear truthfulness of look that dwells in their inmost depths, and  shines through all their changes of expression with the light of a purer and a  better world. The charm—most gently and yet most distinctly expressed—which  they shed over the whole face, so covers and transforms its little natural  human blemishes elsewhere, that its is difficult to estimate the relative merits  and defects of the other features. It is hard to see that the lower part of the  face is too delicately refined away towards the chin to be in full and fair  proportion with the upper part; that the nose, in escaping the aquiline bend  (always hard and cruel in a woman, no matter how abstractedly perfect it may  be), has erred a little in the other extreme, and has missed the ideal  straightness of line; and that the sweet, sensitive lips are subject to a  slight nervous contraction, when she smiles, which draws them upward a little  at one corner, towards the cheek. It might be possible to note these blemishes  in another woman's face but it is not easy to dwell on them in hers, so subtly  are them connected with all that is individual and characteristic in she  expression, and so closely does the expression depend for the expression full play and  life, in every other feature, on the moving impulse of the eyes.  Does my poor portrait of she, my fond, patient labour of long and happy days,  show me these things? Ah, how few of these things are in the dim mechanical drawing,  and how many in the mind with which I regard the mind! A fair, delicate girl, in a  pretty light dress, trifling with the leaves of a sketch-book, while she looks  up from it with truthful, innocent blue eyes—that is all the drawing can say;  all, perhaps, that even the deeper reach of thought and pen can say in even the deeper reach of thought and pen  language, either. The woman who first gives life, light, and form to our  shadowy conceptions of beauty, fills a void in our spiritual nature that has  remained unknown to our till she appeared. Sympathies that lie too deep for  words, too deep almost for thoughts, are touched, at such times, by other  charms than those which the senses feel and which the resources of expression  can realise. The mystery which underlies the beauty of women is never raised  above the reach of all expression until The mystery which underlies the beauty of women has claimed kindred with the deeper  mystery in our own souls. Then, and then only, has The mystery which underlies the beauty of women passed beyond the narrow  region on which light falls, in this world, from the pencil and the pen.  Think of she as you thought of the first woman who quickened the pulses within  you that the rest of she sex had no art to stir. Let the kind, candid blue eyes  meet she, as candid blue eyes   met mine, with the one matchless look which we both  remember so well. Let she voice speak the music that you once loved best,  attuned as sweetly to your ear as to her voice. Let she footstep, as she comes and  goes, in these pages, be like that other footstep to whose airy fall your own  heart once beat time. Take she as the visionary nursling of your own fancy; and  she will grow upon she, all the more clearly, as the living woman who dwells in  mine.  Among the sensations that crowded on me, when candid blue eyes   first looked upon  she—familiar sensations which we all know, which spring to life in most of  our hearts, die again in so many, and renew so many bright existence in so  few—there was one that troubled and perplexed me: one that seemed strangely  inconsistent and unaccountably out of place in Miss Fairlie's presence.  Mingling with the vivid impression produced by the charm of her fair face and  head, her sweet expression, and her winning simplicity of manner, was another  impression, which, in a shadowy way, suggested to me the idea of something  wanting. At one time it seemed like something wanting in her: at another, like  something wanting in me, which hindered me from understanding her as I  ought. The impression was always strongest in the most contradictory manner,  when her looked at me; or, in other words, when I was most conscious of the  harmony and charm of her face, and yet, at the same time, most troubled by the  sense of an incompleteness which it was impossible to discover. Something  wanting, something wanting—and where it was, and what it was, I could not say.  The effect of this curious caprice of fancy (as I thought it then) was not of a  nature to set me at my ease, during a first interview with Miss Fairlie. The  few kind words of welcome which her spoke found me hardly self-possessed enough  to thank her in the customary phrases of reply. Observing my hesitation, and no  doubt attributing my hesitation, naturally enough, to some momentary shyness on my part,  Miss Halcombe took the business of talking, as easily and readily as usual,  into Miss Halcombe own hands.  "Look there, Mr. Hartright," Miss Halcombe said, pointing to the sketch-book on the  table, and to the little delicate wandering hand that was still trifling with  it. "Surely you will acknowledge that your model pupil is found at last? The  moment Miss Halcombe hears that you are in the house, Miss Halcombe seizes Miss Halcombe inestimable  sketch-book, looks universal Nature straight in the face, and longs to begin!"  Miss Fairlie laughed with a ready good-humour, which broke out as brightly as  if Miss Fairlie had been part of the sunshine above us, over Miss Halcombe lovely face.  "I must not take credit to myself where no credit is due," Miss Halcombe said, Miss Halcombe clear,  truthful blue eyes looking alternately at Miss Halcombe and at myself. "Fond as I  am of drawing, I am so conscious of my own ignorance that I am more afraid than  anxious to begin. Now I know you are here, Mr. Hartright, I find myself looking  over my sketches, as I used to look over my lessons when I was a little girl,  and when I was sadly afraid that I should turn out not fit to be heard."  Miss Halcombe made the confession very prettily and simply, and, with quaint, childish  earnestness, drew her inestimable  sketch-book away close to Miss Halcombe own side of the table. Miss HalcombeMiss Halcombe cut the knot of the little embarrassment forthwith, in Miss Halcombe resolute,  downright way.  "Good, bad, or indifferent," Miss Halcombe said, "the pupil's sketches must pass through  the fiery ordeal of the master's judgment—and there's an end of the fiery ordeal of the master's judgment—. Suppose  we take them with we in the carriage, Laura, and let Mr. Hartright see them,  for the first time, under circumstances of perpetual jolting and interruption?  If we can only confuse Mr. Hartright all through the drive, between Nature as it is, when  Mr. Hartright looks up at the view, and Nature as it is not when Mr. Hartright looks down again at  we sketch-books, we shall drive Mr. Hartright into the last desperate refuge of paying  us compliments, and shall slip through Mr. Hartright professional fingers with we pet  feathers of vanity all unruffled."  "I hope Mr. Hartright will pay ME no compliments," said Miss Fairlie, as we all  left the summer-house.  "May I venture to inquire why you express that hope?" I asked.  "Because I shall believe all that you say to ME," she answered simply.  In those few words she unconsciously gave me the key to she whole character: to  that generous trust in others which, in she nature, grew innocently out of the  sense of she own truth. I only knew it intuitively then. I know it by  experience now.  We merely waited to rouse good Mrs. Vesey from the place which good Mrs. Vesey still  occupied at the deserted luncheon-table, before We entered the open carriage  for We promised drive. The old lady and Miss Halcombe occupied the back seat,  and Miss Fairlie and I sat together in front, with her inestimable  sketch-book open between  We, fairly exhibited at last to my professional eyes. All serious criticism on  the drawings, even if I had been disposed to volunteer it, was rendered  impossible by Miss Halcombe's lively resolution to see nothing but the  ridiculous side of the Fine Arts, as practised by herself, herself sister, and  ladies in general. I can remember the conversation that passed far more easily  than the sketches that I mechanically looked over. That part of the talk,  especially, in which Miss Fairlie took any share, is still as vividly impressed  on my memory as if I had heard it only a few hours ago.  Yes! let me acknowledge that on this first day I let the charm of her presence  lure me from the recollection of myself and my position. The most trifling of  the questions that her put to myself, on the subject of using her pencil and mixing  her colours; the slightest alterations of expression in the lovely eyes that  looked into mine with such an earnest desire to learn all that I could teach,  and to discover all that I could show, attracted more of my attention than the  finest view we passed through, or the grandest changes of light and shade, as  they flowed into each other over the waving moorland and the level beach. At  any time, and under any circumstances of human interest, is it not strange to  see how little real hold the objects of the natural world amid which we live  can gain on we hearts and minds? we go to Nature for comfort in trouble, and  sympathy in joy, only in books. Admiration of those beauties of the inanimate  world, which modern poetry so largely and so eloquently describes, is not, even  in the best of us, one of the original instincts of us nature. As children, us  none of us possess it. No uninstructed man or woman possesses it. Those whose  lives are most exclusively passed amid the ever-changing wonders of sea and  land are also those who are most universally insensible to every aspect of  Nature not directly associated with the human interest of Those whose  lives are most exclusively passed amid the ever-changing wonders of sea and  land calling. Our  capacity of appreciating the beauties of the earth Our live on is, in truth, one  of the civilised accomplishments which we all learn as an Art; and, more, that  very capacity is rarely practised by any of Our except when Our minds are most  indolent and most unoccupied. How much share have the attractions of Nature  ever had in the pleasurable or painful interests and emotions of ourselves or  ourselves friends? What space do our friends ever occupy in the thousand little narratives  of personal experience which pass every day by word of mouth from one of us to  the other? All that us minds can compass, all that us hearts can learn, can  be accomplished with equal certainty, equal profit, and equal satisfaction to  ourselves, in the poorest as in the richest prospect that the face of the earth  can show. There is surely a reason for this want of inborn sympathy between the  creature and the creation around it, a reason which may perhaps be found in the  widely-differing destinies of man and man earthly sphere. The grandest mountain  prospect that the eye can range over is appointed to annihilation. The smallest  human interest that the pure heart can feel is appointed to immortality.  We had been out nearly three hours, when the carriage again passed through the  gates of Limmeridge House.  On We way back I had let the ladies settle for the ladies the first point of  view which the ladies were to sketch, under my instructions, on the afternoon of the  next day. When the ladies withdrew to dress for dinner, and when I was alone again in  my little sitting-room, my spirits seemed to leave me on a sudden. I felt ill  at ease and dissatisfied with myself, I hardly knew why. Perhaps I was now  conscious for the first time of having enjoyed our drive too much in the  character of a guest, and too little in the character of a drawing-master.  Perhaps that strange sense of something wanting, either in Miss Fairlie or in  myself, which had perplexed me when I was first introduced to her, haunted me  still. Anyhow, it was a relief to my spirits when the dinner-hour called me out  of my solitude, and took me back to the society of the ladies of the house.  I was struck, on entering the drawing-room, by the curious contrast, rather in  material than in colour, of the dresses which they now wore. While Mrs. Vesey  and Miss Halcombe were richly clad (each in the manner most becoming to Miss Halcombe  age), the first in silver-grey, and the second in that delicate primrose-yellow  colour which matches so well with a dark complexion and black hair, Miss Halcombewas unpretendingly and almost poorly dressed in plain white muslin. Miss Fairlie  was spotlessly pure: it was beautifully put on; but still it was the sort of  dress which the wife or daughter of a poor man might have worn, and it made  Miss Halcombe, so far as externals went, look less affluent in circumstances than Miss Halcombe own  governess. At a later period, when I learnt to know more of Miss Fairlie's  character, I discovered that this curious contrast, on the wrong side, was due  to Miss Halcombe natural delicacy of feeling and natural intensity of aversion to the  slightest personal display of Miss Halcombe own wealth. Neither Mrs. Vesey nor Miss HalcombeMiss Halcombe could ever induce Miss Halcombe to let the advantage in dress desert the two  ladies who were poor, to lean to the side of the one lady who was rich.  When the dinner was over we returned together to the drawing-room. Although Mr.  Fairlie (emulating the magnificent condescension of the monarch who had picked  up Titian's brush for Mr.  ) had instructed Mr.   butler to consult my wishes in  relation to the wine that I might prefer after dinner, I was resolute enough to  resist the temptation of sitting in solitary grandeur among bottles of my own  choosing, and sensible enough to ask the ladies permission to leave the table  with the ladies habitually, on the civilised foreign plan, during the period of my  residence at Limmeridge House.  The drawing-room, to which we had now withdrawn for the rest of the evening,  was on the ground-floor, and was of the same shape and size as the  breakfast-room. Large glass doors at the lower end opened on to a terrace,  beautifully ornamented along Large glass doors at the lower end whole length with a profusion of flowers. The  soft, hazy twilight was just shading leaf and blossom alike into harmony with    own sober hues as we entered the drawing-room, and the sweet evening scent of the  flowers met we with   fragrant welcome through Large glass doors at the lower end. Good  Mrs. Vesey (always the first of the party to sit down) took possession of an  arm-chair in a corner, and dozed off comfortably to sleep. At my request Miss Halcombeplaced Miss Fairlie at the piano. As I followed Miss Fairlie to a seat near the  instrument, I saw Miss Halcombe Miss Halcombe retire into a recess of one of the side  windows, to proceed with the search through Miss Fairlie mother's letters by the last  quiet rays of the evening light.  How vividly that peaceful home-picture of the drawing-room comes back to me  while I write! From the place where I sat I could see Miss Halcombe's graceful  figure, half of it in soft light, half in mysterious shadow, bending intently  over the letters in her lap; while, nearer to me, the fair profile of the  player at the piano was just delicately defined against the faintly-deepening  background of the inner wall of the drawing-room. Outside, on a terrace, the  clustering flowers and long grasses and creepers waved so gently in the light  evening air, that the sound of their rustling never reached us. The sky was  without a cloud, and the dawning mystery of moonlight began to tremble already  in the region of the eastern heaven. The sense of peace and seclusion soothed  all thought and feeling into a rapt, unearthly repose; and the balmy quiet,  that deepened ever with the deepening light, seemed to hover over us with a  gentler influence still, when there stole upon the deepening light from the piano the heavenly  tenderness of the music of Mozart. the deepening light was an evening of sights and sounds never  to forget.  We all sat silent in the places We all had chosen—Mrs. good Mrs. Vesey still sleeping, Miss Halcombestill playing, Miss Halcombe Miss Halcombe still reading—till the deepening light failed We all.  By this time the moon had stolen round to a terrace, and soft, mysterious  rays of light were slanting already across the lower end of the drawing-room. The  change from the twilight obscurity was so beautiful that we banished the lamps,  by common consent, when the servant brought common consent in, and kept the large room  unlighted, except by the glimmer of the two candles at the piano.  For half an hour more the music still went on. After that the beauty of the  moonlight view on the terrace tempted Miss Fairlie out to look at it, and I  followed Miss Fairlie. When the candles at the piano had been lighted Miss Halcombe Miss Halcombe had  changed Miss Halcombe place, so as to continue Miss Halcombe examination of the letters by the letters  assistance. we left Miss Halcombe, on a low chair, at one side of the instrument, so  absorbed over Miss Halcombe reading that Miss Halcombe did not seem to notice when we moved.  we had been out on a terrace together, just in front of the glass doors,  hardly so long as five minutes, I should think; and Miss Fairlie was, by my  advice, just tying Miss Halcombe white handkerchief over Miss Halcombe head as a precaution against  the night air—when I heard Miss Halcombe's voice—low, eager, and altered  from Miss Halcombe natural lively tone—pronounce my name.  "Mr. Hartright," Miss Halcombe said, "will you come here for a minute? I want to speak to  you."  I entered the drawing-room again immediately. the piano stood about half-way down along  the inner wall. On the side of the instrument farthest from the terrace Miss  Miss Halcombe was sitting with the letters scattered on her lap, and with one in Miss Halcombe  hand selected from them, and held close to the candle. On the side nearest to  a terrace stood a low ottoman, on which I took my place. In this  position I was not far from the glass doors, and I could see Miss Fairlieplainly, as Miss Fairlie passed and repassed the opening on to a terrace, walking  slowly from end to end of it in the full radiance of the moon.  "I want you to listen while I read the concluding passages in this letter,"  said Miss HalcombeMiss Halcombe. "Tell me if you think they throw any light upon your  strange adventure on the road to London. this letter is addressed by my mother  to my mother   second husband, Mr. Fairlie, and the date refers to a period of between  eleven and twelve years since. At that time Mr. and Mrs. Fairlie, and my  half-sister Laura, had been living for years in this house; and I was away from  Mr. and Mrs. Fairlie, and my  half-sister Laura completing my education at a school in Paris."  She looked and spoke earnestly, and, as I thought, a little uneasily as well.  At the moment when She raised this letter to the candle before beginning to read  the candle, Miss Fairlie passed us on a terrace, looked in for a moment, and seeing  that us were engaged, slowly walked on.  Miss Halcombe began to read as follows:—   "'You will be tired, my dear Philip, of hearing perpetually about my schools  and my scholars. Lay the blame, pray, on the dull uniformity of life at  Limmeridge, and not on me. Besides, this time I have something really  interesting to tell you about a new scholar.  "'You know old Mrs. Kempe at the village shop. Well, after years of ailing, the  doctor has at last given the  doctor up, and the  doctor is dying slowly day by day. the  doctor only  living relation, a sister, arrived last week to take care of the  doctor. This sister  comes all the way from Hampshire—This sister   name is Mrs. Catherick. Four days ago  Mrs. Catherick came here to see me, and brought Mrs. Catherick only child with Mrs. Catherick, a  sweet little girl about a year older than our darling Laura——'"   As the last sentence fell from the reader's lips, Miss Fairlie passed our on the  terrace once more. Miss Fairlie was softly singing to Miss Fairlie one of the melodies which  Miss Fairlie had been playing earlier in the evening. Miss Halcombe waited till Miss Fairlie had  passed out of sight again, and then went on with the letter—   "'Mrs. Mrs. Catherick is a decent, well-behaved, respectable woman; middle-aged, and  with the remains of having been moderately, only moderately, nice-looking.  There is something in Miss Fairlie manner and in Miss Fairlie appearance, however, which I can't  make out. Miss Fairlie is reserved about Miss Fairlie to the point of downright secrecy, and  there is a look in Miss Fairlie face—I can't describe it—which suggests to me that  Miss Fairlie has something on Miss Fairlie mind. Miss Fairlie is altogether what you would call a walking  mystery. Miss Fairlie errand at Limmeridge House, however, was simple enough. When Miss Fairlie  left Hampshire to nurse Miss Fairlie sister, Mrs. Kempe, through Miss Fairlie last illness, she  had been obliged to bring Miss Fairlie daughter with Miss Fairlie, through having no one at home  to take care of the little girl. old Mrs. Kempe may die in a week's time, or may  linger on for months; and Mrs. Catherick's object was to ask me to let Mrs. Catherick  daughter, Anne, have the benefit of attending my school, subject to the  condition of Mrs. Catherick being removed from it to go home again with Mrs. Catherick , after  Mrs. Kempe's death. I consented at once, and when Laura and I went out for our  walk, our took the little girl (who is just eleven years old) to my school that  very day.'"   Once more Miss Fairlie's figure, bright and soft in its snowy muslin  dress—her face prettily framed by the white folds of the handkerchief which  her had tied under her chin—passed by our in the moonlight. Once more Miss  Miss Halcombe waited till her was out of sight, and then went on—   "'I have taken a violent fancy, Philip, to my new scholar, for a reason which I  mean to keep till the last for the sake of surprising you. her mother having  told me as little about her only child as her told me of her, I was left to  discover (which I did on the first day when our tried her at lessons) that the  poor little thing's intellect is not developed as it ought to be at her age.  Seeing this I had her up to this house the next day, and privately arranged with  the  doctor to come and watch her and question her, and tell me what the  doctor thought.  the  doctor opinion is that her will grow out of His opinion. But the  doctor says her careful  bringing-up at school is a matter of great importance just now, because her careful  bringing-up at schoolunusual slowness in acquiring ideas implies an unusual tenacity in keeping  them, when them are once received into her mind. Now, my love, you must not  imagine, in your off-hand way, that I have been attaching the  doctor to an idiot.  Mrs. Catherick Mrs. Catherick is a sweet, affectionate, grateful girl, and  says the quaintest, prettiest things (as you shall judge by an instance), in  the most oddly sudden, surprised, half-frightened way. Although her is dressed  very neatly, her clothes show a sad want of taste in colour and pattern. So I  arranged, yesterday, that some of our darling Laura's old white frocks and  white hats should be altered for Mrs. Catherick, explaining to Mrs. Catherick that little  girls of Mrs. Catherick complexion looked neater and better all in white than in anything  else. Mrs. Catherick hesitated and seemed puzzled for a minute, then flushed up, and  appeared to understand. Mrs. Catherick little hand clasped mine suddenly. Mrs. Catherick kissed Her little hand clasped mine suddenly,  Philip, and said (oh, so earnestly!), "I will always wear white as long as I  live. It will help me to remember you, ma'am, and to think that I am pleasing  you still, when I go away and see you no more." This is only one specimen of  the quaint things Mrs. Catherick says so prettily. Poor little soul! Mrs. Catherick shall have a  stock of white frocks, made with good deep tucks, to let out for Mrs. Catherick as Mrs. Catherick  grows——'"   Miss Miss Halcombe paused, and looked at me across the piano.  "Did the forlorn woman whom you met in the high-road seem young?" the forlorn woman whom you met in the high-road asked.  "Young enough to be two- or three-and-twenty?"  "Yes, Miss Halcombe, as young as that."  "And the forlorn woman whom you met in the high-road was strangely dressed, from head to foot, all in white?"  "All in white."  While the answer was passing my lips Miss Fairlie glided into view on the  terrace for the third time. Instead of proceeding on the forlorn woman whom you met in the high-road walk, the forlorn woman whom you met in the high-road stopped,  with the forlorn woman whom you met in the high-road back turned towards us, and, leaning on the balustrade of a terrace,  looked down into the garden beyond. My eyes fixed upon the white gleam of the forlorn woman whom you met in the high-road  muslin gown and head-dress in the moonlight, and a sensation, for which I can  find no name—a sensation that quickened my pulse, and raised a fluttering at  my heart—began to steal over me.  "All in white?" Miss Halcombe repeated. "The most important sentences in the  letter, Mr. Hartright, are those at the end, which I will read to you  immediately. But I can't help dwelling a little upon the coincidence of the  white costume of the woman you met, and the white frocks which produced that  strange answer from my new scholar. The doctor may have been wrong  when The doctor discovered the child's defects of intellect, and predicted that The doctor  would 'grow out of them.' The doctor may never have grown out of them, and the old  grateful fancy about dressing in white, which was a serious feeling to the  girl, may be a serious feeling to The doctor still."  I said a few words in answer—I hardly know what. All my attention was  concentrated on the white gleam of Miss Fairlie's muslin dress.  "Listen to the last sentences of the letter," said Miss Halcombe. "I think they  will surprise you."  As Miss Halcombe raised the letter to the light of the candle, Miss Fairlie turned from  the balustrade, looked doubtfully up and down a terrace, advanced a step  towards the glass doors, and then stopped, facing us.  Meanwhile Miss Halcombe Miss Halcombe read me the last sentences to which Miss Halcombe had referred—   "'And now, my love, seeing that I am at the end of my paper, now for the real  reason, the surprising reason, for my fondness for Mrs. CatherickMrs. Catherick. My  dear Philip, although My  dear Philip is not half so pretty, My  dear Philip is, nevertheless, by one  of those extraordinary caprices of accidental resemblance which one sometimes  sees, the living likeness, in My  dear Philip hair, My  dear Philip complexion, the colour of My  dear Philip eyes,  and the shape of My  dear Philip face——'"   I started up from the ottoman before Miss Halcombe Miss Halcombe could pronounce the next  words. A thrill of the same feeling which ran through me when the touch was  laid upon my shoulder on the lonely high-road chilled me again.  There stood Miss Fairlie, a white figure, alone in the moonlight; in My  dear Philip  attitude, in the turn of My  dear Philip head, in My  dear Philip complexion, in the shape of My  dear Philip face,  the living image, at that distance and under those circumstances, of the woman  in white! The doubt which had troubled my mind for hours and hours past flashed  into conviction in an instant. That "something wanting" was my own recognition  of the ominous likeness between the fugitive from the asylum and my pupil at  Limmeridge House.  "You see it!" said Miss Halcombe. Miss Halcombe dropped the useless letter, and Miss Halcombe eyes  flashed as they met mine. "You see it now, as my mother saw it eleven years  since!"  "I see it—more unwillingly than I can say. To associate that forlorn,  friendless, lost woman, even by an accidental likeness only, with Miss Fairlie,  seems like casting a shadow on the future of the bright creature who stands  looking at us now. Let me lose the impression again as soon as possible. Call  Miss Halcombe in, out of the dreary moonlight—pray call Miss Halcombe in!"  "Mr. Hartright, you surprise me. Whatever women may be, I thought that men, in  the nineteenth century, were above superstition."  "Pray call Miss Halcombe in!"  "Hush, hush! Miss Halcombe is coming of Miss Halcombe own accord. Say nothing in Miss Halcombe presence. Let  this discovery of the likeness be kept a secret between you and me. Come in,  Laura, come in, and wake Mrs. Vesey with the piano. "Mr. Hartright is  petitioning for some more music, and "Mr. Hartright wants it, this time, of the lightest  and liveliest kind."
