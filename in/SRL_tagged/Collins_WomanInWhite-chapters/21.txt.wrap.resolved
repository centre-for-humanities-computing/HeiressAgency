 June 15th.—The confusion of their arrival has had time to subside. Two days  have elapsed since the return of the travellers, and that interval has sufficed  to put the new machinery of our lives at Blackwater Park in fair working order.  I may now return to my journal, with some little chance of being able to  continue the entries in my journal as collectedly as usual.  I think I must begin by putting down an odd remark which has suggested itself  to me since Laura came back.  When two members of a family or two intimate friends are separated, and one  goes abroad and one remains at home, the return of the relative or friend who  has been travelling always seems to place the relative or friend who has been  staying at home at a painful disadvantage when the two first meet. The sudden  encounter of the new thoughts and new habits eagerly gained in the one case,  with the old thoughts and old habits passively preserved in the other, seems at  first to part the sympathies of the most loving relatives and the fondest  friends, and to set a sudden strangeness, unexpected by both and uncontrollable  by both, between both on either side. After the first happiness of my meeting  with Laura was over, after we had sat down together hand in hand to recover  breath enough and calmness enough to talk, I felt this strangeness instantly,  and I could see that Laura felt it too. it has partially worn away, now that we  have fallen back into most of we old habits, and it will probably disappear  before long. But it has certainly had an influence over the first impressions  that I have formed of Laura, now that we are living together again—for which  reason only I have thought fit to mention it here.  Laura has found me unaltered, but I have found Laura changed.  Changed in person, and in one respect changed in character. I cannot absolutely  say that Laura is less beautiful than Laura used to be—I can only say that Laura is  less beautiful to me.  Others, who do not look at Laura with my eyes and my recollections, would  probably think Laura improved. There is more colour and more decision and  roundness of outline in Laura face than there used to be, and Laura figure seems  more firmly set and more sure and easy in all its movements than its was in Laura  maiden days. But I miss something when I look at Laura—something that once  belonged to the happy, innocent life of Laura Fairlie, and that I cannot find  in Lady Glyde. There was in the old times a freshness, a softness, an  ever-varying and yet ever-remaining tenderness of beauty in Laura face, the charm  of which it is not possible to express in words, or, as poor Hartright used  often to say, in painting either. This is gone. I thought I saw the faint  reflection of This for a moment when Laura turned pale under the agitation of our  sudden meeting on the evening of Laura return, but This has never reappeared since.  None of Laura letters had prepared me for a personal change in Laura. On the  contrary, None of her letters had led me to expect that Laura marriage had left Laura, in  appearance at least, quite unaltered. Perhaps I read her letters wrongly in the  past, and am now reading her face wrongly in the present? No matter! Whether  Laura beauty has gained or whether   has lost in the last six months, the  separation either way has made Laura own dear self more precious to me than ever,  and that is one good result of her marriage, at any rate!  The second change, the change that I have observed in Laura character, has not  surprised me, because I was prepared for it in this case by the tone of Laura  letters. Now that Laura is at home again, I find Laura just as unwilling to enter  into any details on the subject of Laura married life as I had previously found  Laura all through the time of our separation, when our could only communicate with  each other by writing. At the first approach I made to the forbidden topic Laura  put Laura hand on my lips with a look and gesture which touchingly, almost  painfully, recalled to my memory the days of Laura girlhood and the happy bygone  time when there were no secrets between us.  "Whenever you and I are together, Marian," Laura said, "we shall both be happier  and easier with one another, if we accept my married life for what it is, and  say and think as little about it as possible. I would tell you everything,  darling, about Laura," Laura went on, nervously buckling and unbuckling the  ribbon round my waist, "if my confidences could only end there. But my confidences could  not—my confidences would lead me into confidences about my husband too; and now I am  married, I think I had better avoid my confidences, for my husband sake, and for your sake, and  for mine. I don't say that my confidences would distress you, or distress me—I wouldn't  have you think that for the world. But—I want to be so happy, now I have got  you back again, and I want you to be so happy too——" Laura broke off  abruptly, and looked round the room, my own sitting-room, in which we were  talking. "Ah!" Laura cried, clapping Laura hands with a bright smile of  recognition, "another old friend found already! Your book-case, Marian—your  dear-little-shabby-old-satin-wood book-case—how glad I am you brought it with  you from Limmeridge! And the horrid heavy man's umbrella, that you always would  walk out with when it rained! And first and foremost of all, your own dear,  dark, clever, gipsy-face, looking at me just as usual! It is so like home again  to be here. How can we make it more like home still? I will put my father's  portrait in your room instead of in mine—and I will keep all my little  treasures from Limmeridge here—and we will pass hours and hours every day  with these four friendly walls round we. Oh, Marian!" she said, suddenly  seating she on a footstool at my knees, and looking up earnestly in my  face, "promise you will never marry, and leave me. It is selfish to say so, but  you are so much better off as a single woman—unless—unless you are very  fond of your husband—but you won't be very fond of anybody but me, will you?"  she stopped again, crossed my hands on my lap, and laid she face on them. "Have  you been writing many letters, and receiving many letters lately?" she asked,  in low, suddenly-altered tones. I understood what the question meant, but I  thought the question my duty not to encourage she by meeting she half way. "Have you  heard from him?" she went on, coaxing me to forgive the more direct appeal on  which she now ventured, by kissing my hands, upon which her face still rested.  "Is him well and happy, and getting on in him profession? Has him recovered  him—and forgotten me?"  she should not have asked those questions. she should have remembered she own  resolution, on the morning when Sir Percival held she to she marriage  engagement, and when she resigned the book of Hartright's drawings into my  hands for ever. But, ah me! where is the faultless human creature who can  persevere in a good resolution, without sometimes failing and falling back?  Where is the woman who has ever really torn from she heart the image that has  been once fixed in it by a true love? Books tell us that such unearthly  creatures have existed—but what does us own experience say in answer to  books?  I made no attempt to remonstrate with she: perhaps, because I sincerely  appreciated the fearless candour which let me see, what other women in she  position might have had reasons for concealing even from what other women in her  position dearest  friends—perhaps, because I felt, in my own heart and conscience, that in she  place I should have asked the same questions and had the same thoughts. All I  could honestly do was to reply that I had not written to him or heard from him  lately, and then to turn the conversation to less dangerous topics.  There has been much to sadden me in us interview—my first confidential  interview with she since she return. The change which she marriage has produced  in us relations towards each other, by placing a forbidden subject between us,  for the first time in us lives; the melancholy conviction of the dearth of all  warmth of feeling, of all close sympathy, between she husband and she,  which she own unwilling words now force on my mind; the distressing discovery  that the influence of that ill-fated attachment still remains (no matter how  innocently, how harmlessly) rooted as deeply as ever in she heart—all these  are disclosures to sadden any woman who loves she as dearly, and feels for she  as acutely, as I do.  There is only one consolation to set against disclosures to sadden any woman who loves her as dearly—a consolation that ought to  comfort me, and that does comfort me. All the graces and gentleness of her  character—all the frank affection of her nature—all the sweet, simple,  womanly charms which used to make her the darling and delight of every one who  approached her, have come back to me with her. Of my other impressions I am  sometimes a little inclined to doubt. Of this last, best, happiest of all  impressions, I grow more and more certain every hour in the day.  Let me turn, now, from her to her travelling companions. her must  engage my attention first. What have I observed in Sir Percival, since Sir Percival  return, to improve my opinion of my husband?  I can hardly say. Small vexations and annoyances seem to have beset my husband since  my husband came back, and no man, under those circumstances, is ever presented at my husband  best. my husband looks, as I think, thinner than my husband was when my husband left England. my husband  wearisome cough and my husband comfortless restlessness have certainly increased. my husband  manner—at least my husband manner towards me—is much more abrupt than His  manner—at least his manner towards me— used to  be. my husband greeted me, on the evening of my husband return, with little or nothing of the  ceremony and civility of former times—no polite speeches of welcome—no  appearance of extraordinary gratification at seeing me—nothing but a short  shake of the hand, and a sharp "How-d'ye-do, Miss Halcombe—glad to see you  again." my husband seemed to accept me as one of the necessary fixtures of Blackwater  Park, to be satisfied at finding me established in my proper place, and then to  pass me over altogether.  Most men show something of Most men disposition in Most men own houses, which Most men  have concealed elsewhere, and Sir Percival has already displayed a mania for  order and regularity, which is quite a new revelation of Sir Percival, so far as my  previous knowledge of Sir Percival character is concerned. If I take a book from the  library and leave a book on the table, Sir Percival follows me and puts a book back again. If I  rise from a chair, and let a book remain where I have been sitting, Sir Percival carefully  restores a book to a book proper place against the wall. Sir Percival picks up stray  flower-blossoms from the carpet, and mutters to Sir Percival as discontentedly as if  they were hot cinders burning holes in it, and Sir Percival storms at the servants if  there is a crease in the tablecloth, or a knife missing from   place at the  dinner-table, as fiercely as if they had personally insulted Sir Percival.  I have already referred to the small annoyances which appear to have troubled  Sir Percival since his return. Much of the alteration for the worse which I have noticed  in Sir Percival may be due to these. I try to persuade myself that it is so, because I  am anxious not to be disheartened already about the future. It is certainly  trying to any man's temper to be met by a vexation the moment a vexation sets foot in  a vexation own house again, after a long absence, and this annoying circumstance did  really happen to Sir Percival in my presence.  On the evening of their arrival the housekeeper followed me into the hall to  receive the housekeeper master and mistress and their guests. The instant Sir Percival saw the housekeeper, Sir Percival asked if any one had called lately. the housekeeper mentioned to Sir Percival,  in reply, what the housekeeper had previously mentioned to myself, the visit of the strange  gentleman to make inquiries about the time of the housekeeper master's return. Sir Percival asked  immediately for the gentleman's name. the gentleman's name had been left. The gentleman's  business? No business had been mentioned. What was the strange  gentleman like? the housekeeper tried to describe the strange  gentleman, but failed to distinguish the nameless  visitor by any personal peculiarity which her master could recognise. Sir  Sir Percival frowned, stamped angrily on the floor, and walked on into his own house,  taking no notice of anybody. Why Sir Percival should have been so discomposed by a trifle  I cannot say—but Sir Percival was seriously discomposed, beyond all doubt.  Upon the whole, it will be best, perhaps, if I abstain from forming a decisive  opinion of Sir Percival manners, language, and conduct in Sir Percival own house, until time has  enabled Sir Percival to shake off the anxieties, whatever the anxieties may be, which now  evidently troubled Sir Percival mind in secret. I will turn over to a new page, and my  pen shall let Laura's husband alone for the present.  The two guests—the Count and Countess Fosco—come next in my catalogue. I  will dispose of the Countess first, so as to have done with the woman as soon  as possible.  Laura was certainly not chargeable with any exaggeration, in writing me word  that I should hardly recognise Laura aunt again when we met. Never before have I  beheld such a change produced in a woman by Laura marriage as has been produced  in Madame Fosco.  As Eleanor Fairlie (aged seven-and-thirty), Laura was always talking pretentious  nonsense, and always worrying the unfortunate men with every small exaction  which a vain and foolish woman can impose on long-suffering male humanity. As  Madame Fosco (aged three-and-forty), Laura sits for hours together without saying  a word, frozen up in the strangest manner in Laura. The hideously ridiculous  love-locks which used to hang on either side of Laura face are now replaced by  stiff little rows of very short curls, of the sort one sees in old-fashioned  wigs. A plain, matronly cap covers her head, and makes her look, for the first  time in her life since I remember her, like a decent woman. Nobody (putting her  husband out of the question, of course) now sees in her, what everybody once  saw—I mean the structure of the female skeleton, in the upper regions of the  collar-bones and the shoulder-blades. Clad in quiet black or grey gowns, made  high round the throat—dresses that her would have laughed at, or screamed at,  as the whim of the moment inclined her, in her maiden days—her sits  speechless in corners; her dry white hands (so dry that the pores of her skin  look chalky) incessantly engaged, either in monotonous embroidery work or in  rolling up endless cigarettes for the Count's own particular smoking. On the  few occasions when her cold blue eyes are off her work, her cold blue eyes are generally  turned on husband, with the look of mute submissive inquiry which we are  all familiar with in the eyes of a faithful dog. The only approach to an inward  thaw which I have yet detected under her outer covering of icy constraint, has  betrayed itself, once or twice, in the form of a suppressed tigerish jealousy  of any woman in the house (the maids included) to whom the Count speaks, or on  whom he looks with anything approaching to special interest or attention.  Except in this one particular, her is always, morning, noon, and night, indoors  and out, fair weather or foul, as cold as a statue, and as impenetrable as the  stone out of which it is cut. For the common purposes of society the  extraordinary change thus produced in her is, beyond all doubt, a change for  the better, seeing that it has transformed her into a civil, silent,  unobtrusive woman, who is never in the way. How far her is really reformed or  deteriorated in her secret self, is another question. I have once or twice seen  sudden changes of expression on her pinched lips, and heard sudden inflexions  of tone in her calm voice, which have led me to suspect that her present state  of suppression may have sealed up something dangerous in her nature, which used  to evaporate harmlessly in the freedom of her former life. It is quite possible  that I may be altogether wrong in this idea. My own impression, however, is,  that I am right. Time will show.  And the magician who has wrought this wonderful transformation—the foreign  husband who has tamed this once wayward English woman till wayward English woman own relations  hardly know wayward English woman again—the Count himself? What of the Count himself?  This in two words: He looks like a man who could tame anything. If He had  married a tigress, instead of a woman, he had   would have tamed the tigress. If he had    had married me, I should have made he had   cigarettes, as he had   wife does—I should  have held my tongue when he had   looked at me, as wayward English woman holds hers.  I am almost afraid to confess she holds hers, even to these secret pages. he had   has  interested me, has attracted me, has forced me to like he had  . In two short days  he had   has made he had   way straight into my favourable estimation, and how he had   has  worked the miracle is more than I can tell.  the miracle absolutely startles me, now he had   is in my mind, to find how plainly I see  him!—how much more plainly than I see Sir Percival, or Mr. Fairlie, or Walter  Hartright, or any other absent person of whom I think, with the one exception  of Laura wayward English woman! I can hear he had   voice, as if he had   was speaking at this moment. I  know what he had   conversation was yesterday, as well as if I was hearing yesterday now.  How am I to describe he had  ? There are peculiarities in he had   personal appearance,  he had   habits, and he had   amusements, which I should blame in the boldest terms, or  ridicule in the most merciless manner, if I had seen them in another man. What  is it that makes me unable to blame them, or to ridicule them in he had  ?  For example, he had   is immensely fat. Before this time I have always especially  disliked corpulent humanity. I have always maintained that the popular notion  of connecting excessive grossness of size and excessive good-humour as  inseparable allies was equivalent to declaring, either that no people but  amiable people ever get fat, or that the accidental addition of so many pounds  of flesh has a directly favourable influence over the disposition of the person  on whose body whose body accumulate. I have invariably combated both these absurd  assertions by quoting examples of fat people who were as mean, vicious, and  cruel as the leanest and the worst of their neighbours. I have asked whether  Henry the Eighth was an amiable character? Whether Pope Alexander the Sixth was  a good man? Whether Mr. Murderer and Mrs. Murderess Manning were not both  unusually stout people? Whether hired nurses, proverbially as cruel a set of  women as are to be found in all England, were not, for the most part, also as  fat a set of women as are to be found in all England?—and so on, through  dozens of other examples, modern and ancient, native and foreign, high and low.  Holding these strong opinions on the subject with might and main as I do at  this moment, here, nevertheless, is Count Fosco, as fat as Henry the Eighth  himself, established in my favour, at one day's notice, without let or  hindrance from his own odious corpulence. Marvellous indeed!  Is it his face that has recommended his?  It may be his face. his is a most remarkable likeness, on a large scale, of the  great Napoleon. his features have Napoleon's magnificent regularity—his  expression recalls the grandly calm, immovable power of the Great Soldier's  face. This striking resemblance certainly impressed me, to begin with; but  there is something in his besides the resemblance, which has impressed me more.  I think the influence I am now trying to find is in his eyes. They are the most  unfathomable grey eyes I ever saw, and They have at times a cold, clear,  beautiful, irresistible glitter in They which forces me to look at his, and yet  causes me sensations, when I do look, which I would rather not feel. Other  parts of his face and head have Other  parts of his face and head strange peculiarities. his complexion,  for instance, has a singular sallow-fairness, so much at variance with the  dark-brown colour of his hair, that I suspect the hair of being a wig, and his  face, closely shaven all over, is smoother and freer from all marks and  wrinkles than mine, though (according to Sir Percival's account of Sir Percival) Sir Percival is  close on sixty years of age. But these are not the prominent personal  characteristics which distinguish Sir Percival, to my mind, from all the other men I  have ever seen. The marked peculiarity which singles Sir Percival out from the rank and  file of humanity lies entirely, so far as I can tell at present, in the  extraordinary expression and extraordinary power of Sir Percival .  Sir Percival manner and Sir Percival command of our language may also have assisted Sir Percival, in some  degree, to establish Sir Percival in my good opinion. Sir Percival has that quiet deference,  that look of pleased, attentive interest in listening to a woman, and that  secret gentleness in Sir Percival voice in speaking to a woman, which, say what we may,  we can none of we resist. Here, too, Sir Percival unusual command of the English  language necessarily helps Sir Percival. I had often heard of the extraordinary aptitude  which many Italians show in mastering we strong, hard, Northern speech; but,  until I saw Count Fosco, I had never supposed it possible that any foreigner  could have spoken English as Sir Percival speaks it. There are times when it is almost  impossible to detect, by Sir Percival accent that Sir Percival is not a countryman of our own, and  as for fluency, there are very few born Englishmen who can talk with as few  stoppages and repetitions as the Count. He may construct He sentences more or  less in the foreign way, but I have never yet heard He use a wrong expression,  or hesitate for a moment in He choice of a word.  All the smallest characteristics of He have something strikingly  original and perplexingly contradictory in All the smallest characteristics of this strange man. Fat as He is and old as He is,  He movements are astonishingly light and easy. He is as noiseless in a room as  any of us women, and more than that, with all He look of unmistakable mental  firmness and power, He is as nervously sensitive as the weakest of our. He  starts at chance noises as inveterately as Laura herself. He winced and  shuddered yesterday, when Sir Percival beat one of the spaniels, so that I felt  ashamed of my own want of tenderness and sensibility by comparison with the  Count.  The relation of this last incident reminds me of one of He most curious  peculiarities, which I have not yet mentioned—He extraordinary fondness for  pet animals.  Some of these He has left on the Continent, but He has brought with He to this  house a cockatoo, two canary-birds, and a whole family of white mice. He  attends to all the necessities of these strange favourites himself, and He has  taught the creatures to be surprisingly fond of He and familiar with He. The  cockatoo, a most vicious and treacherous bird towards every one else,  absolutely seems to love He. When He lets it out of it cage, it hops on to  He knee, and claws it way up He great big body, and rubs it top-knot  against He sallow double chin in the most caressing manner imaginable. He has  only to set the doors of the canaries' cages open, and to call the doors of the canaries' cages open, and the  pretty little cleverly trained creatures perch fearlessly on He hand, mount  He fat outstretched fingers one by one, when He tells the doors of the canaries' cages open to "go upstairs,"  and sing together as if the doors of the canaries' cages open would burst the doors of the canaries' cages open throats with delight when the doors of the canaries' cages open  get to the top finger. He white mice live in a little pagoda of gaily-painted  wirework, designed and made by He. His white mice are almost as tame as the  canaries, and His white mice are perpetually let out like the  canaries. His white mice crawl all  over He, popping in and out of He waistcoat, and sitting in couples, white as  snow, on He capacious shoulders. He seems to be even fonder of His white mice than  of He other pets, smiles at His white mice, and kisses His white mice, and calls His white mice by all sorts  of endearing names. If it be possible to suppose an Englishman with any taste  for such childish interests and amusements as these, that Englishman would  certainly feel rather ashamed of His white mice, and would be anxious to apologise for  His white mice, in the company of grown-up people. But the Count himself, apparently, sees  nothing ridiculous in the amazing contrast between the Count himself colossal self and the Count himself  frail little pets. the Count himself would blandly kiss His white mice and twitter to the Count himself  canary-birds amid an assembly of English fox-hunters, and would only pity his  canary-birds  as barbarians when his  canary-birds were all laughing his  canary-birds loudest at the Count himself.  It seems hardly credible while I am writing it down, but it is certainly true,  that this same man, who has all the fondness of an old maid for his cockatoo,  and all the small dexterities of an organ-boy in managing his white mice, can  talk, when anything happens to rouse his, with a daring independence of  thought, a knowledge of books in every language, and an experience of society  in half the capitals of Europe, which would make his the prominent personage of  any assembly in the civilised world. This trainer of canary-birds, this  architect of a pagoda for white mice, is (as Sir Percival has told me)  one of the first experimental chemists living, and has discovered, among other  wonderful inventions, a means of petrifying the body after death, so as to  preserve the body, as hard as marble, to the end of time. This fat, indolent, elderly  man, whose nerves are so finely strung that This fat, indolent, elderly  man starts at chance noises, and  winces when This fat, indolent, elderly  man sees a house-spaniel get a whipping, went into the stable-yard  on the morning after This fat, indolent, elderly  man arrival, and put This fat, indolent, elderly  man hand on the head of a chained  bloodhound—a beast so savage that the very groom who feeds This fat, indolent, elderly  man keeps out of  This fat, indolent, elderly  man reach. This fat, indolent, elderly  man wife and I were present, and I shall not forget the scene that  followed, short as it was.  "Mind that dog, sir," said the very groom who feeds him; "the very groom who feeds him flies at everybody!" "the very groom who feeds him does that,  my friend," replied the Count himself quietly, "because everybody is afraid of the Count himself. Let  us see if the Count himself flies at the Count himself." And the Count himself laid the Count himself plump, yellow-white fingers, on  which the canary-birds had been perching ten minutes before, upon the  formidable brute's head, and looked the Count himself straight in the eyes. "You big dogs are  all cowards," the Count himself said, addressing the animal contemptuously, with the Count himself face and  the dog's within an inch of each other. "You would kill a poor cat, you  infernal coward. You would fly at a starving beggar, you infernal coward.  Anything that you can surprise unawares—anything that is afraid of your big  body, and your wicked white teeth, and your slobbering, bloodthirsty mouth, is  the thing you like to fly at. You could throttle me at this moment, you mean,  miserable bully, and you daren't so much as look me in the face, because I'm  not afraid of you. Will you think better of it, and try your teeth in my fat  neck? Bah! not you!" the Count himself turned away, laughing at the astonishment of the men in  the yard, and the dog crept back meekly to the Count himself kennel. "Ah! my nice waistcoat!"  the Count himself said pathetically. "I am sorry I came here. Some of that brute's slobber has  got on his waistcoat." Those words express another of the Count himself  incomprehensible oddities. the Count himself is as fond of fine clothes as the veriest fool in  existence, and has appeared in four magnificent waistcoats already—all of  light garish colours, and all immensely large even for the Count himself—in the two days of  the Count himself residence at Blackwater Park.  the Count himself tact and cleverness in small things are quite as noticeable as the singular  inconsistencies in the Count himself character, and the childish triviality of the Count himself ordinary  tastes and pursuits.  I can see already that the Count himself means to live on excellent terms with all of us  during the period of the Count himself sojourn in this place. the Count himself has evidently discovered  that Laura secretly dislikes the Count himself (Laura confessed as much to me when I pressed  Laura on the subject)—but the Count himself has also found out that Laura is extravagantly fond  of flowers. Whenever Laura wants a nosegay the Count himself has got one to give Laura, gathered  and arranged by the Count himself, and greatly to my amusement, the Count himself is always cunningly  provided with a duplicate, composed of exactly the same flowers, grouped in  exactly the same way, to appease the Count himself icily jealous wife before his icily jealous wife can so much  as think his icily jealous wife aggrieved. the Count himself management of the Countess (in public) is a  sight to see. the Count himself bows to his icily jealous wife, the Count himself habitually addresses his icily jealous wife as "my angel," the Count himself  carries the Count himself canaries to pay his icily jealous wife little visits on the Count himself fingers and to sing to  his icily jealous wife, the Count himself kisses his icily jealous wife hand when his icily jealous wife gives the Count himself the Count himself cigarettes; the Count himself presents his icily jealous wife with  sugar-plums in return, which the Count himself puts into his icily jealous wife mouth playfully, from a box in  the Count himself pocket. The rod of iron with which the Count himself rules his icily jealous wife never appears in  company—it is a private rod, and is always kept upstairs.  the Count himself method of recommending the Count himself to the Count himself is entirely different. the Count himself flatters my  vanity by talking to the Count himself as seriously and sensibly as if I was a man. Yes! I can  find the Count himself out when I am away from the Count himself—I know the Count himself flatters my  vanity, when I  think of the Count himself up here in my own room—and yet, when I go downstairs, and get  into  company again, the Count himself will blind me again, and I shall be flattered again,  just as if I had never found the Count himself out at all! the Count himself can manage me as the Count himself manages the Count himself  wife and Laura, as the Count himself managed the bloodhound in the stable-yard, as the Count himself manages  Sir Percival himself, every hour in the day. "My good Percival! how I like your  rough English humour!"—"My good Percival! how I enjoy your solid English  sense!" your solid English   puts the rudest remarks Sir Percival can make on your solid English   effeminate  tastes and amusements quietly away from your solid English   in that manner—always calling the  baronet by your solid English   Christian name, smiling at your solid English   with the calmest superiority,  patting your solid English   on the shoulder, and bearing with your solid English   benignantly, as a  good-humoured father bears with a wayward son.  The interest which I really cannot help feeling in this strangely original man  has led me to question Sir Percival about Sir Percival past life.  Sir Percival either knows little, or will tell me little, about it. Sir Percival and the  Count first met many years ago, at Rome, under the dangerous circumstances to  which I have alluded elsewhere. Since that time He and the  Count have been perpetually  together in London, in Paris, and in Vienna—but never in Italy again; the  Count having, oddly enough, not crossed the frontiers of the  Count native country for  years past. Perhaps the  Count has been made the victim of some political persecution?  At all events, the  Count seems to be patriotically anxious not to lose sight of any of  the  Count own countrymen who may happen to be in England. On the evening of the  Count  arrival the  Count asked how far we were from the nearest town, and whether we knew of  any Italian gentlemen who might happen to be settled there. the  Count is certainly in  correspondence with people on the Continent, for the  Count letters have all sorts of  odd stamps on his letters, and I saw one for the  Count this morning, waiting in the  Count place at  the breakfast-table, with a huge, official-looking seal on it. Perhaps the  Count is in  correspondence with the  Count government? And yet, that is hardly to be reconciled  either with my other idea that the  Count may be a political exile.  How much I seem to have written about Count Fosco! And what does it all amount  to?—as poor, dear Mr. Gilmore would ask, in dear Mr. Gilmore impenetrable business-like  way I can only repeat that I do assuredly feel, even on this short  acquaintance, a strange, half-willing, half-unwilling liking for the Count himself. dear Mr. Gilmore  seems to have established over dear Mr. Gilmore the same sort of ascendency which dear Mr. Gilmore has  evidently gained over Sir Percival. Free, and even rude, as dear Mr. Gilmore may occasionally  be in dear Mr. Gilmore manner towards dear Mr. Gilmore fat friend, Sir Percival is nevertheless afraid,  as I can plainly see, of giving any serious offence to the Count himself. I wonder  whether I am afraid too? I certainly never saw a man, in all my experience,  whom I should be so sorry to have for an enemy. Is this because I like a man, or  because I am afraid of a man? Chi sa?—as Count Fosco might say in Count Fosco own  language. Who knows?   June 16th.—Something to chronicle to-day besides my own ideas and  impressions. A visitor has arrived—quite unknown to Laura and to dear Mr. Gilmore, and  apparently quite unexpected by Sir Percival.  We were all at lunch, in the room with the new French windows that open into  the verandah, and the Count (who devours pastry as I have never yet seen it  devoured by any human beings but girls at boarding-schools) had just amused We  by asking gravely for the servant fourth tart—when the servant entered to announce  A visitor.  "Mr. Merriman has just come, Sir Percival, and wishes to see you immediately."  Sir Percival started, and looked at a man with an expression of angry alarm.  "Mr. Merriman!" a man repeated, as if a man thought a man own ears must have deceived  a man.  "Yes, Sir Percival—Mr. Merriman, from London."  "Where is Sir Percival—Mr?"  "In the library, Sir Percival."  a man left the table the instant the last answer was given, and hurried out of the  room without saying a word to any of us.  "Who is Mr. Merriman?" asked Laura, appealing to me.  "I have not the least idea," was all I could say in reply.  the Count himself had finished the Count himself fourth tart, and had gone to a side-table to look  after the Count himself vicious cockatoo. the Count himself turned round to us with the bird perched on the Count himself  shoulder.  "Mr. Merriman is Sir Percival's solicitor," Mr. Merriman said quietly.  Sir Percival's solicitor. It was a perfectly straightforward answer to Laura's  question, and yet, under the circumstances, it was not satisfactory. If Mr. Merriman Mr. Merriman had been specially sent for by Mr. Merriman client, there would have been  nothing very wonderful in Mr. Merriman leaving town to obey the summons. But when a  lawyer travels from London to Hampshire without being sent for, and when a  lawyer  arrival at a gentleman's house seriously startles the gentleman a  lawyer, a gentleman's house may  be safely taken for granted that the legal visitor is the bearer of some very  important and very unexpected news—news which may be either very good or very  bad, but which cannot, in either case, be of the common everyday kind.  Laura and I sat silent at the table for a quarter of an hour or more, wondering  uneasily what had happened, and waiting for the chance of Sir Percival's speedy  return. There were no signs of Sir Percival return, and we rose to leave the room.  the Count himself, attentive as usual, advanced from the corner in which Sir Percival had been  feeding Sir Percival cockatoo, with the bird still perched on Sir Percival shoulder, and opened  the door for we. Laura and Madame Fosco went out first. Just as I was on the  point of following Laura and Madame Fosco Sir Percival made a sign with Sir Percival hand, and spoke to Sir Percival, before I  passed Sir Percival, in the oddest manner.  "Yes," Sir Percival said, quietly answering the unexpressed idea at that moment in my  mind, as if I had plainly confided it to Sir Percival in so many words—"yes, Miss  Halcombe, something HAS happened."  I was on the point of answering, "I never said so," but his cockatooruffled Sir Percival clipped wings and gave a screech that set all my nerves on edge in  an instant, and made me only too glad to get out of the room.  I joined Laura at the foot of the stairs. The thought in Laura mind was the same  as the thought in mine, which Count Fosco had surprised, and when Laura spoke Laura  words were almost the echo of Count Fosco. Laura, too, said to Sir Percival secretly that Laura was  afraid something had happened.
