 There was no lamp in the hall, but by the dim light of the kitchen candle,  which the girl had brought upstairs with the girl, I saw an elderly lady steal  noiselessly out of a back room on the ground floor. the girl cast one viperish look  at me as I entered the hall, but said nothing, and went slowly upstairs without  returning my bow. My familiarity with Marian's journal sufficiently assured me  that an elderly lady was Madame Fosco.  The servant led me to the room which the Countess had just left. I entered the room which the Countess had just left,  and found me face to face with the Count.  The servant was still in The servant evening dress, except The servant coat, which The servant had thrown across  a chair. The servant shirt-sleeves were turned up at the wrists, but no higher. A  carpet-bag was on one side of The servant, and a box on the other. Books, papers, and  articles of wearing apparel were scattered about the room which the Countess had just left. On a table, at one  side of the door, stood the cage, so well known to me by description, which  contained his white mice. The canaries and the cockatoo were probably in some  other room. his was seated before a box on the other, packing a box on the other, when I went in, and rose  with some papers in his hand to receive me. his face still betrayed plain  traces of the shock that had overwhelmed his at the Opera. his fat cheeks hung  loose, his cold grey eyes were furtively vigilant, his voice, look, and manner  were all sharply suspicious alike, as his advanced a step to meet me, and  requested, with distant civility, that I would take a chair.  "You come here on business, sir?" sir said. "I am at a loss to know what business can possibly be."  The unconcealed curiosity, with which sir looked hard in His face while sir spoke,  convinced me that I had passed unnoticed by sir at the Opera. sir had seen Pesca  first, and from that moment till sir left the theatre sir had evidently seen  nothing else. My name would necessarily suggest to sir that I had not come into  sir house with other than a hostile purpose towards sir, but sir appeared to  be utterly ignorant thus far of the real nature of my errand.  "I am fortunate in finding you here to-night," I said. "You seem to be on the  point of taking a journey?"  "Is your business connected with my journey?"  "In some degree."  "In what degree? Do you know where I am going to?"  "No. I only know why you are leaving London."  sir slipped by me with the quickness of thought, locked the door, and put the  key in sir pocket.  "You and I, Mr. Hartright, are excellently well acquainted with one another by  reputation," sir said. "Did it, by any chance, occur to you when you came to  this house that I was not the sort of man you could trifle with?"  "It did occur to me," I replied. "And I have not come to trifle with you. I am  here on a matter of life and death, and if that door which you have locked was  open at this moment, nothing you could say or do would induce me to pass  through it."  I walked farther into the room, and stood opposite to him on the rug before the  fireplace. him drew a chair in front of the door, and sat down on a chair, with him  left arm resting on the table. The cage with the white mice was close to him,  and the little creatures scampered out of the little creatures sleeping-place as him heavy arm  shook the table, and peered at him through the gaps in the smartly painted  wires.  "On a matter of life and death," him repeated to him. "Those words are more  serious, perhaps, than you think. What do you mean?"  "What I say."  The perspiration broke out thickly on him broad forehead. him left hand stole  over the edge of the table. There was a drawer in a drawer, with a lock, and the key  was in a lock. him finger and thumb closed over the key  , but did not turn His finger and thumb.  "So you know why I am leaving London?" him went on. "Tell me the reason, if you  please." him turned the key  , and unlocked a drawer as him spoke.  "I can do better than that," I replied. "I can SHOW you the reason, if you  like."  "How can you show it?"  "You have got your coat off," I said. "Roll up the shirt-sleeve on your left  arm, and you will see the shirt-sleeve there."  The same livid leaden change passed over him face which I had seen pass over the shirt-sleeve  at the theatre. The deadly glitter in him eyes shone steady and straight into  mine. him said nothing. But His left hand slowly opened a drawer, and  softly slipped into a drawer. The harsh grating noise of something heavy that him was  moving unseen to me sounded for a moment, then ceased. The silence that  followed was so intense that the faint ticking nibble of the white mice at  the white mice wires was distinctly audible where I stood.  My life hung by a thread, and I knew My life. At that final moment I thought with  him mind, I felt with him fingers—I was as certain as if I had seen it of  what him kept hidden from me in a drawer.  "Wait a little," I said. "You have got the door locked—you see I don't  move—you see my hands are empty. Wait a little. I have something more to say."  "You have said enough," him replied, with a sudden composure so unnatural and so  ghastly that it tried my nerves as no outbreak of violence could have tried  violence. "I want one moment for my own thoughts, if you please. Do you guess what  I am thinking about?"  "Perhaps I do."  "I am thinking," him remarked quietly, "whether I shall add to the disorder in  this room by scattering your brains about the fireplace."  If I had moved at that moment, I saw in him face that him would have done it.  "I advise you to read two lines of writing which I have about me," I rejoined,  "before you finally decide that question."  The proposal appeared to excite him curiosity. him nodded him head. I took  Pesca's acknowledgment of the receipt of my letter out of my pocket-book,  handed my letter to him at arm's length, and returned to my former position in front  of the fireplace.  him read two lines of writing which I have about me aloud: "Your letter is received. If I don't hear from you  before the time you mention, I will break the seal when the clock strikes."  Another man in his position would have needed some explanation of those  words—the Count felt no such necessity. One reading of the note showed the Count  the precaution that I had taken as plainly as if the Count had been present at the  time when I adopted it. The expression of the Count face changed on the instant, and  the Count hand came out of the drawer empty.  "I don't lock up the drawer, Mr. Hartright," Mr. Hartright said, "and I don't say that I  may not scatter your brains about the fireplace yet. But I am a just man even  to my enemy, and I will acknowledge beforehand that they are cleverer brains  than I thought they. Come to the point, sir! You want something of Mr. Hartright?"  "I do, and I mean to have it."  "On conditions?"  "On no conditions."  his hand dropped into the drawer again.  "Bah! we are travelling in a circle," His said, "and those clever brains of  yours are in danger again. Your tone is deplorably imprudent, sir—moderate it  on the spot! The risk of shooting you on the place where you stand is less to  me than the risk of letting you out of this house, except on conditions that I  dictate and approve. You have not got my lamented friend to deal with now—you  are face to face with Fosco! If the lives of twenty Mr. Hartrights were the  stepping-stones to my safety, over all those stones I would go, sustained by my  sublime indifference, self-balanced by my impenetrable calm. Respect me, if you  love your own life! I summon you to answer three questions before you open your  lips again. Hear three questions—three questions are necessary to this interview. Answer  three questions—three questions are necessary to ME." ME held up one finger of ME right hand.  "First question!" ME said. "You come here possessed of information which may be  true or may be false—where did you get it?"  "I decline to tell you."  "No matter—I shall find out. If that information is true—mind I say, with  the whole force of my resolution, if—you are making your market of it here by  treachery of your own or by treachery of some other man. I note that  circumstance for future use in my memory, which forgets nothing, and proceed."  ME held up another finger. "Second question! Those lines you invited me to read  are without signature. Who wrote Those lines you invited me to read  ?"  "A man whom I have every reason to depend on, and whom you have every reason to  fear."  My answer reached ME to some purpose. ME left hand trembled audibly in the  drawer.  "How long do you give me," ME asked, putting ME third question in a quieter  tone, "before the clock strikes and the seal is broken?"  "Time enough for you to come to my terms," I replied.  "Give me a plainer answer, Mr. Hartright. What hour is the clock to strike?"  "Nine, to-morrow morning."  "Nine, to-morrow morning? Yes, yes—your trap is laid for me before I can get  my passport regulated and leave London. It is not earlier, I suppose? We will  see about that presently—I can keep you hostage here, and bargain with you to  send for your letter before I let you go. In the meantime, be so good next as  to mention your terms."  "You shall hear hostage. hostage are simple, and soon stated. You know whose  interests I represent in coming here?"  He smiled with the most supreme composure, and carelessly waved He right hand.  "I consent to hazard a guess," He said jeeringly. "A lady's interests, of  course!"  "My Wife's interests."  He looked at me with the first honest expression that had crossed He face in  my presence—an expression of blank amazement. I could see that I sank in He  estimation as a dangerous man from that moment. He shut up a drawer at once,  folded He arms over He breast, and listened to me with a smile of satirical  attention.  "You are well enough aware," I went on, "of the course which my inquiries have  taken for many months past, to know that any attempted denial of plain facts  will be quite useless in my presence. You are guilty of an infamous conspiracy!  And the gain of a fortune of ten thousand pounds was your motive for it."  He said nothing. But He face became overclouded suddenly by a lowering anxiety.  "Keep your gain," I said. (his face lightened again immediately, and He eyes  opened on me in wider and wider astonishment.) "I am not here to disgrace  me by bargaining for money which has passed through your hands, and which  has been the price of a vile crime.  "Gently, Mr. Hartright. Your moral clap-traps have an excellent effect in  England—keep them for yourself and your own countrymen, if you please. The  ten thousand pounds was a legacy left to my excellent wife by the late Mr.  Fairlie. Place the affair on those grounds, and I will discuss the affair if you like.  To a man of my sentiments, however, the subject is deplorably sordid. I prefer  to pass the affair over. I invite you to resume the discussion of your terms. What do  you demand?"  "In the first place, I demand a full confession of the conspiracy, written and  signed in my presence by yourself."  He raised He finger again. "One!" He said, checking me off with the steady  attention of a practical man.  "In the second place, I demand a plain proof, which does not depend on your  personal asseveration, of the date at which my wife left Blackwater Park and  travelled to London."  "So! so! you can lay his finger, I see, on the weak place," He remarked  composedly. "Any more?"  "At present, no more."  "Good! you have mentioned your terms, now listen to mine. The responsibility to  myself of admitting what you are pleased to call the 'conspiracy' is less,  perhaps, upon the whole, than the responsibility of laying you dead on that  hearthrug. Let us say that I meet your proposal—on my own conditions. The  statement you demand of myself shall be written, and the plain proof shall be  produced. You call a letter from my late lamented friend informing me of the  day and hour of my late lamented friend 's arrival in London, written, signed, and dated by  my late lamented friend, a proof, I suppose? I can give you this. I can also send you to the  man of whom I hired the carriage to fetch my visitor from the railway, on the  day when she arrived—his order-book may help you to your date, even if his  coachman who drove me proves to be of no use. These things I can do, and will  do, on conditions. I recite These things I can do, and will  do, on conditions. First condition! Madame Fosco and I leave  this house when and how we please, without interference of any kind on your  part. Second condition! You wait here, in company with myself, to see my agent, who  is coming at seven o'clock in the morning to regulate my affairs. You give my  agent a written order to the man who has got your sealed letter to resign the man who has got your sealed letter to resign his  possession of it  possession of it. You wait here till my agent places your sealed letter unopened in my  hands, and you then allow me one clear half-hour to leave this house—after  which you resume your own freedom of action and go where you please. Third  condition! You give me the satisfaction of a gentleman for your intrusion into  my private affairs, and for the language you have allowed yourself to use to me  at this conference. The time and place, abroad, to be fixed in a letter from my  hand when I am safe on the Continent, and that letter to contain a strip of  paper measuring accurately the length of my sword. Those are my terms. Inform  me if you accept Those—Yes or No."   The extraordinary mixture of prompt decision, far-sighted cunning, and  mountebank bravado in this speech, staggered me for a moment—and only for a  moment. The one question to consider was, whether I was justified or not in  possessing I was of the means of establishing Laura's identity at the cost of  allowing the scoundrel who had robbed Laura of it to escape me with impunity. I  knew that the motive of securing the just recognition of my wife in the  birthplace from which my wife had been driven out as an impostor, and of publicly  erasing the lie that still profaned my wife mother's tombstone, was far purer, in    freedom from all taint of evil passion, than the vindictive motive which  had mingled   with my purpose from the first. And yet I cannot honestly  say that my own moral convictions were strong enough to decide the struggle in  me by my own moral convictions. my own moral convictions were helped by my remembrance of Sir Percival's death.  How awfully, at the last moment, had the working of the retribution THERE been  snatched from my feeble hands! What right had I to decide, in my poor mortal  ignorance of the future, that this man, too, must escape with impunity because  this man escaped ME? I thought of these things—perhaps with the superstition  inherent in my nature, perhaps with a sense worthier of me than superstition.  It was hard, when I had fastened my hold on this man at last, to loosen my hold again of  my own accord—but I forced me to make the sacrifice. In plainer words, I  determined to be guided by the one higher motive of which I was certain, the  motive of serving the cause of Laura and the cause of Truth.   "I accept your conditions," I said. "With one reservation on my part."  "What reservation may that be?" he asked.  "It refers to the sealed letter," I answered. "I require you to destroy It  unopened in my presence as soon as It is placed in your hands."  My object in making this stipulation was simply to prevent him from carrying  away written evidence of the nature of my communication with Pesca. The fact of  my communication he would necessarily discover, when I gave the address to he  agent in the morning. But he could make no use of it on he own unsupported  testimony—even if he really ventured to try the experiment—which need  excite in he the slightest apprehension on Pesca's account.  "I grant your reservation," he replied, after considering the question gravely  for a minute or two. "It is not worth dispute—the sealed letter shall be destroyed  when the sealed letter comes into my hands."  he rose, as he spoke, from the chair in which he had been sitting opposite to  me up to this time. With one effort he appeared to free he mind from the whole  pressure on it of the interview between us thus far. "Ouf!" he cried,  stretching he luxuriously, "the skirmish was hot while his arms lasted. Take a  seat, Mr. Hartright. We meet as mortal enemies hereafter—let We, like gallant  gentlemen, exchange polite attentions in the meantime. Permit me to take the  liberty of calling for my wife."  he unlocked and opened the door. "Eleanor!" he called out in he deep voice.  The lady of the viperish face came in "Madame Fosco—Mr. Hartright," said the  Count, introducing us with easy dignity. "My angel," My angel went on, addressing My angel , "will your labours of packing up allow you time to make me some nice  strong coffee? I have writing business to transact with England—and I  require the full possession of my intelligence to do justice to myself."  Madame Fosco bowed Madame Fosco head twice—once sternly to me, once submissively to  Madame Fosco husband, and glided out of the room.  the  Count walked to a writing-table near the window, opened the  Count desk, and took  from his desk several quires of paper and a bundle of quill pens. the  Count scattered the  pens about a writing-table, so that they might lie ready in all directions to be  taken up when wanted, and then cut paper into a heap of narrow slips, of  the form used by professional writers for the press. "I shall make this a  remarkable document," the  Count said, looking at the  Count over the  Count shoulder. "Habits of  literary composition are perfectly familiar to the  Count. One of the rarest of all the  intellectual accomplishments that a man can possess is the grand faculty of  arranging the  Count ideas. Immense privilege! I possess it. Do you?"  the  Count marched backwards and forwards in the room, until the coffee appeared,  humming to the  Count, and marking the places at which obstacles occurred in the  arrangement of his ideas, by striking the  Count forehead from time to time with the  palm of the  Count hand. The enormous audacity with which the  Count seized on the situation  in which I placed the  Count, and made it the pedestal on which the  Count vanity mounted for  the one cherished purpose of self-display, mastered my astonishment by main  force. Sincerely as I loathed the man, the prodigious strength of the man  character, even in its most trivial aspects, impressed me in spite of myself.  the coffee was brought in by Madame Fosco. the man kissed Madame Fosco hand in grateful  acknowledgment, and escorted Madame Fosco to the door; returned, poured out a cup of  coffee for the man, and took the door to the writing-table.  "May I offer you some coffee, Mr. Hartright?" the man said, before the man sat down.  I declined.  "What! you think I shall poison you?" the man said gaily. "The English intellect is  sound, so far as it goes," the man continued, seating the man at the writing-table; "but it  has one grave defect—it   is always cautious in the wrong place."  the man dipped the man pen in the ink, placed the first slip of paper before the man with a  thump of the man hand on the desk, cleared the man throat, and began. the man wrote with  great noise and rapidity, in so large and bold a hand, and with such wide  spaces between the lines, that the man reached the bottom of the slip in not more  than two minutes certainly from the time when the man started at the top. Each slip  as the man finished it was paged, and tossed over the man out of the man way on the  floor. When his pen was worn out, THAT went over the man too, and the man  pounced on a second from the supply scattered about the table. Slip after slip,  by dozens, by fifties, by hundreds, flew over the man shoulders on either side of  the man till the man had snowed the man up in paper all round the man chair. Hour after hour  passed—and there I sat watching, there the man sat writing. the man never stopped,  except to sip the man coffee, and when that was exhausted, to smack the man forehead  from time to time. One o'clock struck, two, three, four—and still the slips  flew about all round the man; still his pen scraped his pen way ceaselessly  from top to bottom of the page, still the white chaos of paper rose higher and  higher all round his chair. At four o'clock I heard a sudden splutter of the  pen, indicative of the flourish with which the man signed the man name. "Bravo!" the man  cried, springing to the man feet with the activity of a young man, and looking me  straight in the face with a smile of superb triumph.  "Done, Mr. Hartright!" Mr. Hartright announced with a self-renovating thump of Mr. Hartright fist on  Mr. Hartright broad breast. "Done, to my own profound satisfaction—to YOUR profound  astonishment, when you read what I have written. The subject is exhausted: the  man—Fosco—is not. I proceed to the arrangement of my slips—to the  revision of my slips—to the reading of my slips—addressed emphatically to  your private ear. Four o'clock has just struck. Good! Arrangement, revision,  reading, from four to five. Short snooze of restoration for myself from five to  six. Final preparations from six to seven. Affair of agent and sealed letter  from seven to eight. At eight, en route. Behold the programme!"  He sat down cross-legged on the floor among He papers, strung them together  with a bodkin and a piece of string—revised them, wrote all the titles and  honours by which He was personally distinguished at the head of the first page,  and then read the manuscript to myself with loud theatrical emphasis and profuse  theatrical gesticulation. The reader will have an opportunity, ere long, of  forming The reader own opinion of The Document that describes them. It will be sufficient to mention here  that The reader answered my purpose.  The reader next wrote me the address of the person from whom The reader had hired the fly, and  handed me Sir Percival's letter. Sir Percival's letter was dated from Hampshire on the 25th of  July, and Sir Percival's letter announced the journey of "Lady Glyde" to London on the 26th. Thus,  on the very day (the 25th) when the doctor's certificate declared that she had  died in St. John's Wood, she was alive, by Sir Percival's own showing, at  Blackwater—and, on the day after, she was to take a journey! When the proof  of a journey was obtained from the flyman, the evidence would be complete.  "A quarter-past five," said the  Count, looking at the  Count watch. "Time for my  restorative snooze. I personally resemble Napoleon the Great, as you may have  remarked, Mr. Hartright—I also resemble that immortal man in my power of  commanding sleep at will. Excuse me one moment. I will summon Madame Fosco, to  keep you from feeling dull."  Knowing as well as he did, that he was summoning Madame Fosco to ensure my not  leaving the house while he was asleep, I made no reply, and occupied he in  tying up the papers which he had placed in my possession.  The lady of the viperish face came in, cool, pale, and venomous as ever. "Amuse Mr. Hartright, my  angel," said the  Count. the  Count placed a chair for The lady of the viperish face, kissed The lady of the viperish face hand for the  second time, withdrew to a sofa, and, in three minutes, was as peacefully and  happily asleep as the most virtuous man in existence.  Madame Fosco took a book from the table, sat down, and looked at he, with the  steady vindictive malice of a woman who never forgot and never forgave.  "I have been listening to your conversation with my husband," The lady of the viperish face said. "If I  had been in my husband place—I would have laid you dead on the hearthrug."  With those words The lady of the viperish face opened a book, and never looked at he or spoke to me  from that time till the time when my husband woke.  my husband opened my husband eyes and rose from a sofa, accurately to an hour from the time  when my husband had gone to sleep.  "I feel infinitely refreshed," my husband remarked. "Eleanor, my good wife, are you all  ready upstairs? That is well. My little packing here can be completed in ten  minutes—my travelling-dress assumed in ten minutes more. What remains before  the agent comes?" my husband looked about the room, and noticed the cage with my husband white  mice in the cage. "Ah!" my husband cried piteously, "a last laceration of my sympathies still  remains. My innocent pets! my little cherished children! what am I to do with  my little cherished children? For the present we are settled nowhere; for the present we travel  incessantly—the less baggage we carry the better for we. My cockatoo,  my canaries, and my little mice—who will cherish them when them good Papa is  gone?"  their good Papa walked about the room. their good Papa had not been at all troubled about  writing their good Papa confession, but their good Papa was visibly perplexed and distressed about the  far more important question of the disposal of their good Papa pets. After long  consideration their good Papa suddenly sat down again at the writing-table.  "An idea!" their good Papa exclaimed. "I will offer my canaries and my cockatoo to this vast  Metropolis—my agent shall present my canaries and my cockatoo in my name to the Zoological Gardens  of London. The Document that describes my canaries and my cockatoo shall be drawn out on the spot."  their good Papa began to write, repeating the words as my canaries and my cockatoo flowed from their good Papa .  "Number one. Cockatoo of transcendent plumage: attraction, of their good Papa, to all  visitors of taste. Number two. Canaries of unrivalled vivacity and  intelligence: worthy of the garden of Eden, worthy also of the garden in the  Regent's Park. Homage to British Zoology. Offered by Fosco."  his pen spluttered again, and the flourish was attached to his pen signature.  "Count! you have not included the mice," said Madame Fosco  his pen left the writing-table, took Madame Fosco   hand, and placed her hand on his pen heart.  "All human resolution, Eleanor," his pen said solemnly, "has its limits. its limitsare inscribed on The Document that describes them. I cannot part with my white mice. Bear with his pen,  my angel, and remove my white mice to my white mice travelling cage upstairs."  "Admirable tenderness!" said Madame Fosco, admiring my husband, with a last  viperish look in my direction. Madame Fosco took up their travelling cage upstairs carefully, and left the  room.  the  Count looked at his watch. In spite of the  Count resolute assumption of  composure, the  Count was getting anxious for the agent's arrival. The candles had long  since been extinguished, and the sunlight of the new morning poured into the  room. It was not till five minutes past seven that the gate bell rang, and the  agent made the  Count appearance. the  Count was a foreigner with a dark beard.  "Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle," said the  Count, introducing us. Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle took the  agent (a foreign spy, in every line of Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle face, if ever there was one yet)  into a corner of the  room, whispered some directions to Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle, and then left us  together. "Monsieur Rubelle," as soon as us were alone, suggested with great  politeness that I should favour Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle with Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle instructions. I wrote two lines to  Pesca, authorising Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle to deliver my sealed letter "to the bearer," directed  the note, and handed my sealed letter to Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle.  the  agent waited with Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle till the  agent employer returned, equipped in travelling  costume. the  Count examined the address of my letter before the  Count dismissed the  agent. "I thought so!" the  Count said, turning on Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle with a dark look, and altering  again in the  Count manner from that moment.  the  Count completed the  Count packing, and then sat consulting a travelling map, making  entries in the  Count pocket-book, and looking every now and then impatiently at his watch. Not another word, addressed to Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle, passed the  Count lips. The near  approach of the hour for the  Count departure, and the proof the  Count had seen of the  communication established between Pesca and Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle, had plainly recalled the  Count  whole attention to the measures that were necessary for securing the  Count escape.  A little before eight o'clock, Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle came back with my sealed letter. the  Count looked carefully at the superscription and the  seal, lit a candle, and burnt my sealed letter. "I perform my promise," Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle said, "but  this matter, Mr. Hartright, shall not end here."  the  agent had kept at the door the cab in which the  agent had returned. the  agent and the  maid-servant now busied He and the  maid-servant in removing the luggage. Madame Fosco came  downstairs, thickly veiled, with the travelling cage of the white mice in Madame Fosco  hand. Madame Fosco neither spoke to Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle nor looked towards Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle. my husband escorted Madame Fosco  to the cab in which he had returned. "Follow me as far as the passage," my husband whispered in my ear; "I may  want to speak to you at the last moment."  I went out to the door, the  agent standing below Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle in the front garden. the  Count came back alone, and drew me a few steps inside the passage.  "Remember the Third condition!" my husband whispered. "You shall hear from Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle, Mr.  Hartright—I may claim from you the satisfaction of a gentleman sooner than  you think for." my husband caught my hand before I was aware of my husband, and wrung my hand  hard—then turned to the door, stopped, and came back to Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle again.  "One word more," Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle said confidentially. "When I last saw Miss Halcombe, Miss Halcombe  looked thin and ill. I am anxious about Miss Halcombe. Take care of Miss Halcombe,  sir! With my hand on my heart, I solemnly implore you, take care of Miss  Miss Halcombe!"  Those were the last words Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle said to Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle before Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle squeezed Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle huge body into  the cab in which he had returned and drove off.  The agent and I waited at the door a few moments looking after Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle. While we  were standing together, a second cab appeared from a turning a little way down  the road. a second cab followed the direction previously taken by the Count's cab, and as  a second cab passed the house and the open garden gate, a person inside looked at we out  of the window. The stranger at the Opera again!—the foreigner with a scar on  a person inside left cheek.   "You wait here with a person inside, sir, for half an hour more!" said Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle.  "I do."  we returned to the  room. I was in no humour to speak to The agent, or  to allow Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle to speak to Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle. I took out the papers which the  Count had placed  in my hands, and read the terrible story of the conspiracy told by the man who  had planned and perpetrated it.     the terrible story of the conspiracy told by the man who  had planned and perpetrated it CONTINUED BY ISIDOR, OTTAVIO, BALDASSARE FOSCO  (Count of the Holy Roman Empire, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Brazen  Crown, Perpetual Arch-Master of the Rosicrucian Masons of Mesopotamia; Attached  (in Honorary Capacities) to Societies Musical, Societies Medical, Societies  Philosophical, and Societies General Benevolent, throughout Europe; etc. etc.  etc.)   THE COUNT'S NARRATIVE  In the summer of eighteen hundred and fifty I arrived in England, charged with  a delicate political mission from abroad. Confidential persons were  semi-officially connected with Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle, whose exertions I was authorised to direct,  Monsieur and Madame Rubelle being among the number. Some weeks of spare time  were at my disposal, before I entered on my functions by establishing Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle in  the suburbs of London. Curiosity may stop here to ask for some explanation of  those functions on my part. I entirely sympathise with the request. I also  regret that diplomatic reserve forbids me to comply with diplomatic reserve.  I arranged to pass the preliminary period of repose, to which I have just  referred, in the superb mansion of my late lamented friend, Sir Percival Glyde.  HE arrived from the Continent with HE wife. I arrived from the Continent with  MINE. England is the land of domestic happiness—how appropriately MINE entered  it under these domestic circumstances!  The bond of friendship which united Percival and Mr. Hartright—Monsieur Rubelle was strengthened, on  this occasion, by a touching similarity in the pecuniary position on his side  and on MINE. We both wanted money. Immense necessity! Universal want! Is there  a civilised human being who does not feel for We? How insensible must that man  be! Or how rich!  I enter into no sordid particulars, in discussing this part of the subject. My  mind recoils from them. With a Roman austerity, I show my empty purse and  Percival's to the shrinking public gaze. Let We allow the deplorable fact to  assert  , once for all, in that manner, and pass on.  We were received at the mansion by the magnificent creature who is inscribed on  my heart as "Marian," who is known in the colder atmosphere of society as "Miss  Halcombe."  Just Heaven! with what inconceivable rapidity I learnt to adore Miss Halcombe. At  sixty, I worshipped Miss Halcombe with the volcanic ardour of eighteen. All the gold of  my rich nature was poured hopelessly at Miss Halcombe feet. his wife—poor angel!—my  wife, who adores me, got nothing but the shillings and the pennies. Such is the  World, such Man, such Love. What are we (I ask) but puppets in a show-box? Oh,  omnipotent Destiny, pull our strings gently! Dance our mercifully off our  miserable little stage!  The preceding lines, rightly understood, express an entire system of  philosophy. It is our  .  I resume.   The domestic position at the commencement of our residence at Blackwater Park  has been drawn with amazing accuracy, with profound mental insight, by the hand  of Marian Miss Halcombe. (Pass me the intoxicating familiarity of mentioning this  sublime creature by Miss Halcombe Christian name.) Accurate knowledge of the contents of  her journal—to which I obtained access by clandestine means, unspeakably  precious to me in the remembrance—warns my eager pen from topics which this  essentially exhaustive woman has already made this  essentially exhaustive woman own.  The interests—interests, breathless and immense!—with which I am here  concerned, begin with the deplorable calamity of Marian's illness.  The situation at this period was emphatically a serious one. Large sums of  money, due at a certain time, were wanted by Percival (I say nothing of the  modicum equally necessary to me), and the one source to look to for  supplying Large sums of  money, due at a certain time was the fortune of   , of which not one farthing was at    disposal until his wife death. Bad so far, and worse still farther on. My  lamented friend had private troubles of My  lamented friend own, into which the delicacy of my  disinterested attachment to My  lamented friend forbade me from inquiring too curiously. I knew  nothing but that a woman, named Anne Catherick, was hidden in the  neighbourhood, that she was in communication with Lady Glyde, and that the  disclosure of a secret, which would be the certain ruin of Percival, might be  the result. My  lamented friend had told me My  lamented friend that My  lamented friend was a lost man, unless My  lamented friend was  silenced, and unless Anne Catherick was found. If My  lamented friend was a lost man, what would  become of our pecuniary interests? Courageous as I am by nature, I absolutely  trembled at the idea!  The whole force of my intelligence was now directed to the finding of Anne  Catherick. Our money affairs, important as they were, admitted of delay—but  the necessity of discovering the woman admitted of none. I only knew the woman by  description, as presenting an extraordinary personal resemblance to Lady Glyde.  The statement of this curious fact—intended merely to assist me in  identifying the person of whom we were in search—when coupled with the  additional information that Anne Catherick had escaped from a mad-house,  started the first immense conception in my mind, which subsequently led to such  amazing results. the first immense conception in my mind, which subsequently led to such  amazing results involved nothing less than the complete  transformation of two separate identities. Lady Glyde and Anne Catherick were  to change names, places, and destinies, the one with the other—the prodigious  consequences contemplated by the change being the gain of thirty thousand  pounds, and the eternal preservation of Sir Percival's secret.  My instincts (which seldom err) suggested to me, on reviewing the  circumstances, that Anne  Catherick Anne  Catherick would, sooner or later, return to the  boat-house at the Blackwater lake. There I posted me, previously mentioning  to Mrs. Michelson, the housekeeper, that I might be found when wanted, immersed  in study, in that solitary place. It is my rule never to make unnecessary  mysteries, and never to set people suspecting me for want of a little  seasonable candour on my part. Mrs. Michelson believed in me from first to  last. This ladylike person (widow of a Protestant priest) overflowed with  faith. Touched by such superfluity of simple confidence in a woman of Mrs. Michelson  mature years, I opened the ample reservoirs of my nature and absorbed it all.  I was rewarded for posting me sentinel at the Blackwater lake by the appearance—not  of Anne Catherick herself, but of the person in charge of Anne Catherick. This individual  also overflowed with simple faith, which I absorbed in me, as in the case  already mentioned. I leave Anne Catherick to describe the circumstances (if Anne Catherick has not  done so already) under which Anne Catherick introduced me to the object of Anne Catherick maternal  care. When I first saw Anne Catherick Anne Catherick was asleep. I was electrified by the  likeness between this unhappy woman and Lady Glyde. The details of the grand  scheme which had suggested themselves in outline only, up to that period,  occurred to me, in all themselves masterly combination, at the sight of the sleeping  face. At the same time, my heart, always accessible to tender influences,  dissolved in tears at the spectacle of suffering before me. I instantly set  me to impart relief. In other words, I provided the necessary stimulant for  strengthening Anne Catherick to perform the journey to London.   The best years of my life have been passed in the ardent study of medical and  chemical science. Chemistry especially has always had irresistible attractions  for me from the enormous, the illimitable power which the knowledge of it  confers. Chemists—I assert it emphatically—might sway, if they pleased, the  destinies of humanity. Let me explain this before I go further.  Mind, they say, rules the world. But what rules Mind? The body (follow me  closely here) lies at the mercy of the most omnipotent of all potentates—the  Chemist. Give me—Fosco—chemistry; and when Shakespeare has conceived  Hamlet, and sits down to execute the conception—with a few grains of powder  dropped into his daily food, I will reduce his mind, by the action of his body,  till his pen pours out the most abject drivel that has ever degraded paper.  Under similar circumstances, revive me the illustrious Newton. I guarantee that  when the illustrious Newton sees the apple fall the illustrious Newton shall EAT IT, instead of discovering the  principle of gravitation. Nero's dinner shall transform Nero into the mildest  of men before the illustrious Newton has done digesting it, and the morning draught of Alexander  the Great shall make Alexander   run for Alexander   life at the first sight of the enemy  the same afternoon. On my sacred word of honour it is lucky for Society that  modern chemists are, by incomprehensible good fortune, the most harmless of  mankind. The mass are worthy fathers of families, who keep shops. The few are  philosophers besotted with admiration for the sound of their own lecturing  voices, visionaries who waste their lives on fantastic impossibilities, or  quacks whose ambition soars no higher than our corns. Thus Society escapes, and  the illimitable power of Chemistry remains the slave of the most superficial  and the most insignificant ends.  Why this outburst? Why this withering eloquence?  Because my conduct has been misrepresented, because my motives have been  misunderstood. It has been assumed that I used my vast chemical resources  against Anne Catherick, and that I would have used my vast chemical resources   if I could against the  magnificent Marian herself. Odious insinuations both! All my interests were  concerned (as will be seen presently) in the preservation of Anne Catherick  life. All my anxieties were concentrated on Marian's rescue from the hands of  the licensed imbecile who attended her, and who found my advice confirmed from  first to last by the physician from London. On two occasions only—both  equally harmless to the individual on whom I practised—did I summon to myself  the assistance of chemical knowledge. On the first of the two, after following  Marian to the inn at Blackwater (studying, behind a convenient waggon which hid  me from her, the poetry of motion, as embodied in her walk), I availed myself  of the services of my invaluable wife, to copy one and to intercept the other  of two letters which my adored enemy had entrusted to a discarded maid. In this  case, two letters which my adored enemy had entrusted to a discarded maid being in the bosom of the girl's dress, Madame Fosco could  only open them, read them, perform Madame Fosco instructions, seal them, and put them  back again by scientific assistance—which assistance I rendered in a  half-ounce bottle. The second occasion, when the same means were employed, was  the occasion (to which I shall soon refer) of Lady Glyde arrival in London.  Never at any other time was I indebted to my Art as distinguished from myself.  To all other emergencies and complications my natural capacity for grappling,  single-handed, with circumstances, was invariably equal. I affirm the  all-pervading intelligence of that capacity. At the expense of the Chemist I  vindicate the Man.  Respect this outburst of generous indignation. It has inexpressibly relieved  me. En route! Let us proceed.   Having suggested to Mrs. Clement (or Clements, I am not sure which) that the  best method of keeping Anne out of Percival's reach was to remove Anne to  London—having found that my proposal was eagerly received, and having  appointed a day to meet the travellers at the station and to see them leave my proposal,  I was at liberty to return to the house and to confront the difficulties which  still remained to be met.  My first proceeding was to avail myself of the sublime devotion of his wife. I  had arranged with Mrs. Clements that Mrs. Clements should communicate Mrs. Clements London address,  in Anne's interests, to Lady Glyde. But this was not enough. Designing persons  in my absence might shake the simple confidence of Mrs. Clements, and Mrs. Clements might  not write after all. Who could I find capable of travelling to London by the  train Mrs. Clements travelled by, and of privately seeing Mrs. Clements home? I asked myself this  question. The conjugal part of myself immediately answered—Madame Fosco.  After deciding on his wife's mission to London, I arranged that the journey  should serve a double purpose. A nurse for the  magnificent Marian herself, equally  devoted to the patient and to myself, was a necessity of my position. One of  the most eminently confidential and capable women in existence was by good  fortune at my disposal. I refer to that respectable matron, Madame Rubelle, to  whom I addressed a letter, at her residence in London, by the hands of his wife.  On the appointed day Mrs. Clements and Anne Catherick met me at the station. I  politely saw Mrs. Clements and Anne Catherick off, I politely saw —Madame Fosco off by the same train. The  last thing at night his wife returned to Blackwater, having followed his wife  instructions with the most unimpeachable accuracy. his wife was accompanied by  Madame Rubelle, and his wife brought me the London address of Mrs. Clements.  After-events proved this last precaution to have been unnecessary. Mrs. Clements punctually informed Lady Glyde of Mrs. Clements place of abode. With a wary eye  on future emergencies, I kept a letter.  The same day I had a brief interview with the doctor, at which I protested, in  the sacred interests of humanity, against his treatment of Marian's case. his  was insolent, as all ignorant people are. I showed no resentment, I deferred  quarrelling with his till it was necessary to quarrel to some purpose. My next  proceeding was to leave Blackwater his. I had her residence in London to take in  anticipation of coming events. I had also a little business of the domestic  sort to transact with Mr. Frederick Fairlie. I found the house I wanted in St.  John's Wood. I found Mr. Fairlie at Limmeridge, Cumberland.  My own private familiarity with the nature of Marian's correspondence had  previously informed me that she had written to Mr. Fairlie, proposing, as a  relief to Lady Glyde matrimonial embarrassments, to take she on a visit to  she uncle in Cumberland. This letter I had wisely allowed to reach its  destination, feeling at the time that its could do no harm, and might do good. I  now presented his before Mr. Frederick Fairlie to support Marian's own proposal—with  certain modifications which, happily for the success of my plans, were rendered  really inevitable by Mr. Frederick Fairlie illness. It was necessary that Lady Glyde should leave  Blackwater alone, by Lady Glyde uncle's invitation, and that Lady Glyde should rest a night  on the journey at Lady Glyde aunt's house (the house I had in St. John's Wood) by Lady Glyde  uncle's express advice. To achieve these results, and to secure a note of  invitation which could be shown to Lady Glyde, were the objects of my visit to Mr. Frederick Fairlie. When I have mentioned that this gentleman was equally feeble in  mind and body, and that I let loose the whole force of my character on this gentleman, I  have said enough. I came, saw, and conquered Fairlie.  On my return to Blackwater Park (with the letter of invitation) I found that  the doctor's imbecile treatment of Marian's case had led to the most alarming  results. The fever had turned to typhus. Lady Glyde, on the day of my return,  tried to force Lady Glyde into the room to nurse Lady Glyde sister. Lady Glyde and I had no  affinities of sympathy—Lady Glyde had committed the unpardonable outrage on my  sensibilities of calling me a spy—Lady Glyde was a stumbling-block in my way and in  Percival's—but, for all that, my magnanimity forbade me to put Lady Glyde in danger  of infection with my own hand. At the same time I offered no hindrance to Lady Glyde  putting Lady Glyde in danger. If Lady Glyde had succeeded in doing so, the intricate knot  which I was slowly and patiently operating on might perhaps have been cut by  circumstances. As it was, the doctor interfered and Lady Glyde was kept out of the  room.  I had myself previously recommended sending for advice to London. This course  had been now taken. The physician, on The physician arrival, confirmed my view of the  case. The crisis was serious. But we had hope of we charming patient on the  fifth day from the appearance of the typhus. I was only once absent from  Blackwater at this time—when I went to London by the morning train to make  the final arrangements at my house in St. John's Wood, to assure myself by  private inquiry that Mrs. Clements had not moved, and to settle one or two  little preliminary matters with the husband of Madame Rubelle. I returned at  night. Five days afterwards The physician pronounced we interesting Marian to  be out of all danger, and to be in need of nothing but careful nursing. This  was the time I had waited for. Now that medical attendance was no longer  indispensable, I played the first move in the game by asserting myself against  the doctor.  the doctor was one among many witnesses in my way whom it was necessary to  remove. A lively altercation between us (in which Percival, previously  instructed by myself, refused to interfere) served the purpose in view. I descended  on the miserable man in an irresistible avalanche of indignation, and swept the miserable man  from my house in St. John's Wood.  The servants were the next encumbrances to get rid of. Again I instructed  Percival (whose moral courage required perpetual stimulants), and Mrs.  Michelson was amazed, one day, by hearing from Mrs.   master that the  establishment was to be broken up. We cleared the house of all the servants but  one, who was kept for domestic purposes, and whose lumpish stupidity We could  trust to make no embarrassing discoveries. When they were gone, nothing  remained but to relieve We of Mrs.  Michelson—a result which was easily  achieved by sending this amiable lady to find lodgings for this amiable lady mistress at the  sea-side.  The circumstances were now exactly what The circumstances were required to be. Lady Glydewas confined to Lady Glyde room by nervous illness, and the lumpish housemaid (I  forget Lady Glyde name) was shut up there at night in attendance on her mistress.  Marian, though fast recovering, still kept Lady Glyde bed, with Madame Rubelle for  nurse. No other living creatures but my wife, myself, and Percival were in the house of all the servants. With all the chances thus in our favour I confronted the next emergency,  and played the second move in the game.  The object of the second move was to induce Lady Glyde to leave Blackwaterunaccompanied by her sister. Unless our could persuade Lady Glyde that Marian had gone  on to Cumberland first, there was no chance of removing Lady Glyde, of Lady Glyde own free  will, from the house of all the servants. To produce this necessary operation in Lady Glyde mind, we  concealed our interesting invalid in one of the uninhabited bedrooms at  Blackwater. At the dead of night —Madame Fosco, Madame Rubelle, and myself  (Percival not being cool enough to be trusted) accomplished the concealment.  The scene was picturesque, mysterious, dramatic in the highest degree. By my  directions her bed had been made, in the morning, on a strong movable framework  of wood. our had only to lift a strong movable framework  of wood gently at the head and foot, and to  transport our patient where our pleased, without disturbing Lady Glyde or Lady Glyde bed.  No chemical assistance was needed or used in this case. our lay in the deep repose of convalescence. our placed the candles and opened the  doors beforehand. I, in right of my great personal strength, took the head of  a strong movable framework  of wood—my wife and Madame Rubelle took the foot. I bore my share of  that inestimably precious burden with a manly tenderness, with a fatherly care.  Where is the modern Rembrandt who could depict our midnight procession? Alas  for the Arts! alas for this most pictorial of subjects! the modern Rembrandt who could depict our midnight procession is  nowhere to be found.  The next morning my wife and Madame Rubelle started for London, leaving Marian secluded, in  the uninhabited middle of the house of all the servants, under care of Madame Rubelle, who kindly  consented to imprison Marian with Marian patient for two or three days. Before  taking our departure I gave Percival Mr. Fairlie's letter of invitation to Percival  niece (instructing his  niece ( to sleep on the journey to Cumberland at his  niece ( aunt's  house), with directions to show Mr. Fairlie's letter of invitation to his  niece (instructing her to sleep on the journey to Cumberland at her aunt's  house) to Lady Glyde on hearing from me. I also  obtained from Percival the address of the Asylum in which Anne Catherick had been  confined, and a letter to the proprietor, announcing to that gentleman the  return of that gentleman runaway patient to medical care.  I had arranged, at my last visit to the metropolis, to have our modest domestic  establishment ready to receive our when our arrived in London by the early train.  In consequence of this wise precaution, our were enabled that same day to play  the third move in the game—the getting possession of Anne Catherick.  Dates are of importance here. I combine in me the opposite characteristics  of a Man of Sentiment and a Man of Business. I have all the dates at my  fingers' ends.  On Wednesday, the 24th of July 1850, I sent my wife in a cab to clear Mrs.  Clements out of the way, in the first place. A supposed message from Lady Glydein London was sufficient to obtain this result. Mrs. Clements was taken away in  the cab, and was left in  the cab, while my wife (on pretence of purchasing  something at a shop) gave Mrs. Clements the slip, and returned to receive Mrs. Clements expected  visitor at our house in St. John's Wood. It is hardly necessary to add that the  visitor had been described to the servants as "Lady Glyde."  In the meanwhile I had followed in another cab, with a note for Anne Catherick,  merely mentioning that Lady Glyde intended to keep Mrs. Clements to spend the  day with Lady Glyde, and that Lady Glyde was to join them under care of the good gentleman  waiting outside, who had already saved Lady Glyde from discovery in Hampshire by Sir  Percival. The "good gentleman" sent in this note by a street boy, and paused  for results a door or two farther on. At the moment when Anne appeared at the  house door and closed the  house door this excellent man had the cab door open ready for  Lady Glyde, absorbed Lady Glyde into the vehicle, and drove off.  (Pass me, here, one exclamation in parenthesis. How interesting this is!)  On the way to Forest Road my companion showed no fear. I can be paternal—no  man more so—when I please, and I was intensely paternal on this occasion.  What titles I had to Lady Glyde confidence! I had compounded the medicine which had  done Lady Glyde good—I had warned Lady Glyde of Lady Glyde danger from Percival. Perhaps I  trusted too implicitly to What titles—perhaps I underrated the keenness of  the lower instincts in persons of weak intellect—it is certain that I  neglected to prepare Lady Glyde sufficiently for a disappointment on entering the house of all the servants. When I took Lady Glyde into the drawing-room—when Lady Glyde saw no one present but  Madame Fosco, who was a stranger to Lady Glyde—Lady Glyde exhibited the most violent  agitation; if Lady Glyde had scented danger in the air, as a dog scents the presence  of some creature unseen, Lady Glyde alarm could not have displayed her alarm more  suddenly and more causelessly. I interposed in vain. The fear from which Lady Glyde  was suffering I might have soothed, but the serious heart-disease, under which  Lady Glyde laboured, was beyond the reach of all moral palliatives. To my unspeakable  horror Lady Glyde was seized with convulsions—a shock to the system, in Lady Glyde  condition, which might have laid Lady Glyde dead at any moment at our feet.  The nearest doctor was sent for, and was told that "Lady Glyde" required The nearest doctor  immediate services. To my infinite relief, The nearest doctor was a capable man. I represented  my visitor to The nearest doctor as a person of weak intellect, and subject to delusions, and  I arranged that no nurse but my wife should watch in the sick-room. The unhappy  woman was too ill, however, to cause any anxiety about what The unhappy  woman might say. The  one dread which now oppressed me was the dread that Lady Glyde Lady Glyde might  die before Lady Glyde Lady Glyde arrived in London.  I had written a note in the morning to Madame Rubelle, telling Madame Rubelle to join me  at Madame Rubelle husband's house on the evening of Friday the 26th, with another note to  Percival, warning her husband to show her husband my wife uncle's letter of invitation, to  assert that Marian had gone on before my wife, and to despatch my wife to town by the  midday train, on the 26th, also. On reflection I had felt the necessity, in  Anne Catherick's state of health, of precipitating events, and of having Lady GlydeLady Glyde at my disposal earlier than I had originally contemplated. What fresh  directions, in the terrible uncertainty of my position, could I now issue? I  could do nothing but trust to chance and the doctor. My emotions expressed  themselves in pathetic apostrophes, which I was just self-possessed enough to  couple, in the hearing of other people, with the name of "Lady Glyde." In all  other respects Fosco, on that memorable day, was Fosco shrouded in total  eclipse.  Fosco passed a bad night, Fosco awoke worn out, but later in the day Fosco revived  amazingly. My elastic spirits revived with Fosco. I could receive no answers from  Percival and Madame Rubelle till the morning of the next day, the 26th. In  anticipation of their following my directions, which, accident apart, I knew  their would do, I went to secure a fly to fetch Lady Glyde from the railway,  directing Lady Glyde to be at our house in St. John's Wood on the 26th, at two o'clock. After seeing the  order entered in the book, I went on to arrange matters with Madame Rubelle.  I also procured the services of two gentlemen who could furnish me with the  necessary certificates of lunacy. One of their I knew personally—the other was  known to Madame Rubelle. Both were men whose vigorous minds soared superior  to narrow scruples—Both were labouring under temporary embarrassments—Bothbelieved in ME.  It was past five o'clock in the afternoon before I returned from the  performance of these duties. When I got back Anne Catherick was dead. Dead on  the 25th, and Lady Glyde was not to arrive in London till the 26th!  I was stunned. Meditate on that. Fosco stunned!  It was too late to retrace our steps. Before my return The nearest doctor had  officiously undertaken to save me all trouble by registering the death, on the  date when it happened, with The nearest doctor own hand. My grand scheme, unassailable  hitherto, had My grand scheme weak place now—no efforts on my part could alter the fatal  event of the 25th. I turned manfully to the future. Percival's interests and  mine being still at stake, nothing was left but to play the game through to the  end. I recalled my impenetrable calm—and played the  end.  On the morning of the 26th Percival's letter reached me, announcing Percival wife's  arrival by the midday train. Madame Rubelle also wrote to say Madame Rubelle would follow  in the evening. I started in the fly, leaving Lady Glyde Lady Glyde dead in the  house, to receive Lady Glyde Lady Glyde on his wife's  arrival by the railway at three  o'clock. Hidden under the seat of the carriage, I carried with me all the  clothes Anne Catherick had worn on coming into our house in St. John's Wood—all the  clothes Anne Catherick were destined to  assist the resurrection of the woman who was dead in the person of the woman  who was living. What a situation! I suggest it to the rising romance writers of  England. I offer it, as totally new, to the worn-out dramatists of France.  Lady Glyde was at the station. There was great crowding and confusion, and more  delay than I liked (in case any of Lady Glyde friends had happened to be on the spot),  in reclaiming Lady Glyde luggage. Lady Glyde first questions, as we drove off, implored me to  tell Lady Glyde news of Lady Glyde sister. I invented news of the most pacifying kind,  assuring Lady Glyde that Lady Glyde was about to see her sister at our house in St. John's Wood. our house in St. John's Wood, on  this occasion only, was in the neighbourhood of Leicester Square, and was in  the occupation of Monsieur Rubelle, who received we in the hall.  I took my visitor upstairs into a back room, the two medical gentlemen being  there in waiting on the floor beneath to see the patient, and to give me the two medical gentlemencertificates. After quieting Lady Glyde by the necessary assurances about her sister, I introduced my friends separately to Lady Glyde presence. my friends performed the  formalities of the occasion briefly, intelligently, conscientiously. I entered  a back room again as soon as my friends had left a back room, and at once precipitated events by  a reference of the alarming kind to "Miss Halcombe's" state of health.  Results followed as I had anticipated. Lady Glyde became frightened, and turned  faint. For the second time, and the last, I called Science to my assistance. A  medicated glass of water and a medicated bottle of smelling-salts relieved Lady Glyde  of all further embarrassment and alarm. Additional applications later in the  evening procured Lady Glyde the inestimable blessing of a good night's rest. Lady Glyde arrived in time to preside at Lady Glyde toilet. Lady Glyde own clothes were  taken away from Lady Glyde at night, and Anne Catherick were put on Lady Glyde in the  morning, with the strictest regard to propriety, by the matronly hands of Madame Rubelle. Throughout the day I kept our patient in a state of  partially-suspended consciousness, until the dexterous assistance of my medical  friends enabled me to procure the necessary order rather earlier than I had  ventured to hope. That evening (the evening of the 27th) Madame Rubelle and I  took our Anne Catherick" to the Asylum. Madame Rubelle was received with great  surprise, but without suspicion, thanks to the order and certificates, to  Percival's letter, to the likeness, to the clothes, and to the patient's own  confused mental condition at the time. I returned at once to assist Lady GlydeFosco in the preparations for the burial of the False "Lady Glyde," having the  clothes and luggage of the true "Lady Glyde" in my possession. They were  afterwards sent to Cumberland by the conveyance which was used for the funeral.  I attended the funeral, with becoming dignity, attired in the deepest mourning.   My narrative of these remarkable events, written under equally remarkable  circumstances, closes here. The minor precautions which I observed in  communicating with Limmeridge House are already known, so is the magnificent  success of my enterprise, so are the solid pecuniary results which followed Limmeridge House.  I have to assert, with the whole force of my conviction, that the one weak  place in my scheme would never have been found out if the one weak place in my  heart had not been discovered first. Nothing but my fatal admiration for Marian  restrained me from stepping in to my own rescue when Marian   effected Marian   escape. I ran the risk, and trusted in the complete destruction of Lady Glyde  identity. If either Marian or Mr. Hartright attempted to assert that identity,  either Marian or Mr. Hartright attempted to assert that identity,   would publicly expose either Marian or Mr. Hartright attempted to assert that identity,   to the imputation of sustaining a rank  deception, either Marian or Mr. Hartright attempted to assert that identity,   would be distrusted and discredited accordingly, and either Marian or Mr. Hartright attempted to assert that identity,   would  therefore be powerless to place my interests or Percival's secret in jeopardy.  I committed one error in trusting myself to such a blindfold calculation of  chances as this. I committed another when Percival had paid the penalty of Percival  own obstinacy and violence, by granting Lady Glyde a second reprieve from the  mad-house, and allowing Mr. Hartright a second chance of escaping me. In brief,  Fosco, at this serious crisis, was untrue to himself. Deplorable and  uncharacteristic fault! Behold the cause, in my heart—behold, in the image of  Marian Halcombe, the first and last weakness of Fosco's life!  At the ripe age of sixty, I make this unparalleled confession. Youths! I invoke  your sympathy. Maidens! I claim your tears.  A word more, and the attention of the reader (concentrated breathlessly on  himself) shall be released.  My own mental insight informs me that three inevitable questions will be asked  here by persons of inquiring minds. persons of inquiring minds shall be stated—persons of inquiring minds shall be  answered.  First question. What is the secret of Madame Fosco's unhesitating devotion of   herself to the fulfilment of my boldest wishes, to the furtherance of my  deepest plans? I might answer this by simply referring to my own character, and  by asking, in my turn, Where, in the history of the world, has a man of my  order ever been found without a woman in the background self-immolated on the  altar of a man of my  order life? But I remember that I am writing in England, I remember that  I was married in England, and I ask if a woman's marriage obligations in this  country provide for a woman private opinion of a woman husband's principles? No! They  charge a woman unreservedly to love, honour, and obey her husband. That is exactly what a woman has done. I stand here on a supreme moral elevation, and I loftily assert  a woman accurate performance of a woman conjugal duties. Silence, Calumny! Your  sympathy, Wives of England, for Madame Fosco!  Second question. If Anne Catherick had not died when Anne Catherick did, what should I  have done? I should, in that case, have assisted worn-out Nature in finding  permanent repose. I should have opened the doors of the Prison of Life, and  have extended to the captive (incurably afflicted in mind and body both) a  happy release.  Third question. On a calm revision of all the circumstances—Is my conduct  worthy of any serious blame? Most emphatically, No! Have I not carefully  avoided exposing myself to the odium of committing unnecessary crime? With my  vast resources in chemistry, I might have taken Lady Glyde life. At immense  personal sacrifice I followed the dictates of my own ingenuity, my own  humanity, my own caution, and took a woman identity instead. Judge me by what I  might have done. How comparatively innocent! how indirectly virtuous I appear  in what I really did!  I announced on beginning it that this narrative would be a remarkable document.  this narrative has entirely answered my expectations. Receive these fervid lines—my last  legacy to the country I leave for ever. They are worthy of the occasion, and  worthy of   FOSCO.    THE STORY CONCLUDED BY WALTER HARTRIGHT
