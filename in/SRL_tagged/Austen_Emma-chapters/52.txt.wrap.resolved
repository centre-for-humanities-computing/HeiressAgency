It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as Emma to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by letter. How much worse, had Their been obliged to meet! Harriet expressed Harriet very much as might be supposed, without reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in Emma style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.-- It might be only her own consciousness; but It seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke. Emma had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and Emma was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Emma was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to Emma--and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, Emma was quite eager to have Harriet under Emma care.--When it was thus settled on Emma sister's side, Emma proposed it to Emma friend, and found Emma very Harriet Harriet was to go; Harriet was invited for at least a fortnight; Harriet was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square. Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now Emma could talk, and Emma could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted Emma when remembering how disappointed a heart was near Emma, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings which Emma had led astray Emma. The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but Emma could not think of Emma in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must be averting the past, and carrying Emma out of Emma. Emma would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in Emma mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication before Emma, one which _Emma_ only could be competent to make--the confession of Emma engagement to Emma father; but Emma would have nothing to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well. No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those Emma loved--and the evil should not act on Emma by anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers. Emma soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.-- Emma ought to go--and Emma was longing to see Emma; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a _secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which Emma should attend to any thing Jane might communicate. Jane went--Jane had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when Jane Jane had been in such distress as had filled Jane with compassion, though all the worst of Jane sufferings had been unsuspected.-- The fear of being still unwelcome, determined Jane, though assured of The fear of being still unwelcome being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up Jane name.-- Jane heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; Jane heard nothing but the instant reply of, "Beg Jane to walk up;"--and a moment afterwards Jane was met on the stairs by Jane, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of Jane were felt sufficient.-- Emma had never seen Jane look so well, so lovely, so engaging. There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every thing which Jane countenance or manner could ever have wanted.-- Jane came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very feeling tone, "This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being so entirely without words." sufficient.-- Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checked sufficient.-- Emma, and made it expedient to compress all sufficient.-- Emma friendly and all sufficient.-- Emma congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.

You and I shall not want opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already. I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is not offended. You see how delightfully Mrs. S. writes. Oh! Mrs. S. is a sweet creature! You would have doated on Mrs. S., had you gone.--But not a word more. Let our be discreet--quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines-- I forget the poem at this moment: "For when a lady's in the case, "You know all other things give place." Now I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read----mum! a word to the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I? But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My_ representation, you see, has quite appeased Mrs. S.." And again, on Emma's merely turning Emma head to look at Mrs. Bates's knitting, Emma added, in a half whisper, "I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as a minister of state. I managed it extremely well." Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every possible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs. Weston, Emma found Emma abruptly addressed with, "Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?--Do not you think recovered?--Do cure does Perry the highest credit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon my word, Perry has restored recovered?--Do in a wonderful short time!-- Oh! if you had seen recovered?--Do, as I did, when recovered?--Do was at the worst!"-- And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther, "We do not say a word of any _assistance_ that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit." "I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse," Perry shortly afterwards began, "since the party to Box Hill. the party to Box Hill. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.--So a little cloud appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think a little cloud answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to our collecting the party to Box Hill, and exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?-- It must be the party to Box Hill, you know, quite the same party, not _one_ exception." Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of Emma first answer to Emma, resulting, Emma supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing. "Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible to say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane's prospects--that is, I do not mean.--But dearest Jane is charmingly recovered.-- How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.-- Such a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.-- Charming young man!--that is--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--such attention to Jane!"--And from Jane!"--And great, Jane!"--And more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.-- After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said, "Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master. my lord and master promised to join me here, and pay my lord and master respects to my good friend." "What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?-- That will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits, and Mrs. Elton's time is so engaged." "Upon my word my word is, poor Miss Bates really is engaged from morning to night.--There is no end of people's coming to poor Miss Bates, on some pretence or other.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always wanting poor Miss Bates opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without him.--'Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, 'rather you than I.-- I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I had half so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.--However, he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all." And putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma--"A congratulatory visit, you know.--Oh! yes, quite indispensable." sufficient.-- Emma sufficient.-- Emma looked about sufficient.-- Emma, so sufficient.-- Emma "He promised to come to me as soon as He could disengage He from Knightley; but He and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand." Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, "Is Mrs. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk." "Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley own way." "Have not you mistaken the day?" said Emma. "I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr as for Saturday." "Oh! no, the meeting at the Crown is certainly to-day," was the abrupt answer, which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.-- "I do believe," Mrs. Elton's side.-- continued, "this is the most troublesome parish that ever was. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove." "the most troublesome parish that ever was there was small," said Jane. "Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject talked of." "But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge; the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children." "Ah! you clever creature, that's very true. What a thinking brain you have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if We could be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already.--But hush!--not a word, if you please." It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give Jane words, not to Mrs. Elton, but to dear Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw. The wish of distinguishing Jane, as far as civility permitted, was very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look. Mrs. Elton made Mrs. Elton appearance. the good old lady greeted Mrs. Elton with some of the good old lady sparkling vivacity. "Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!-- But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.-- Here have I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience--for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?" Mrs. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away. Mrs. Elton civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but Mrs. Elton subsequent object was to lament over Mrs. Elton for the heat Mrs. Elton was suffering, and the walk Mrs. Elton had had for nothing. "When I got to Donwell," said Mrs. Elton, "Knightley could not be found. Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent Mrs. Elton this morning, and the message Mrs. Elton returned, that Mrs. Elton should certainly be at home till one." "Donwell!" cried Mrs. Elton wife.--"My dear Mr. E., you have not been to Donwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crownthe Crown." "No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!-- I went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made it so much the worse. And then not to find Mrs. Elton at home! I assure you I am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The housekeeper declared The housekeeper knew nothing of my being expected.-- Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way Very extraordinary!--And was gone. Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into Very extraordinary!--And woods.-- Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain this?" Emma amused Emma by protesting that it was very extraordinary, indeed, and that Emma had not a syllable to say for Very extraordinary!--And. "I cannot imagine," said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do,) "I cannot imagine how Very extraordinary!--And could do such a thing by you, of all people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E. must have left a message for you, I am sure The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E. must.--Not "Knightley could be so very eccentric;-- and "Knightley servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a creature as Very extraordinary!--And Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration. And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds Mrs. Hodges very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt, and never sent her very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt." "I met William Larkins," continued Mrs. Elton, "as I got near the house, and William Larkins told me I should not find William Larkins master at home, but I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour. William Larkins did not know what was come to his master lately, William Larkins said, but William Larkins could hardly ever get the speech of William Larkins. I have nothing to do with William's wants, but nothing to do with William's wants really is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley to-day; and nothing to do with William's wants becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose." Emma felt that Emma could not do better than go home directly. In all probability Emma was at this very time waited for there; and Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mrs. Elton, if not towards William Larkins. Emma was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend Emma out of the room, to go with Emma even downstairs; it gave Emma an opportunity which Emma immediately made use of, to say, "It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent." "Oh!" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought infinitely more becoming to Emma than all the elegance of all Emma usual composure--"there would have been no danger. no danger would have been of my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest--. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more collectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very great misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not disgusted to such a degree as to--I have not time for half that I could wish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for me. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately--in short, if your compassion does not stand my friend--" "Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are," cried Emma warmly, and taking Emma hand. "You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe whom, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted even--" "You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.-- So cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life of deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you." "Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side. Let us forgive each other at once. us must do whatever is to be done quickest, and I think us feelings will lose no time there. I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor?" "Very." "And the next news, I suppose, will be, that us are to lose you--just as I begin to know you." "Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell." "Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps," replied Emma, smiling--"but, excuse me, it must be thought of." The smile was returned as Jane answered, "You are very right; The smile has been thought of. And I will own to you, (I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for." "Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured of.-- Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!-- Good-bye, good-bye."
