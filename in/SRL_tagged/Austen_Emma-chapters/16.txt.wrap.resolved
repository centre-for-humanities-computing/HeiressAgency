The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow of every thing Emma had been wishing for!--Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst of all. Every part of a blow for Harriet!--that brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and Emma would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--more in error--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than Emma actually was, could the effects of Emma blunders have been confined to Emma. "If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne any thing. I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man might have doubled I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man presumption to me--but HarrietHarriet!" How Emma could have been so deceived!--He protested that I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man had never thought seriously of Harriet--never! Emma looked back as well as Emma could; but it was all confusion. Emma had taken up the idea, Emma supposed, and made every thing bend to the idea. I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man manners, however, must have been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or Emma could not have been so misled. The picture!--How eager I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man had been about the picture!--and the charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its "ready wit"--but then the "soft eyes"--in fact its suited neither; its was a jumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such thick-headed nonsense? Certainly Emma had often, especially of late, thought His manners to Emma unnecessarily gallant; but His manners had passed as I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man way, as a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others that I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man had not always lived in the best society, that with all the gentleness of I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, Emma had never, for an instant, suspected an instant to mean any thing but grateful respect to Emma as Harriet's friend. To Mr. John Knightley was Emma indebted for Emma first idea on the subject, for the first start of the subject possibility. There was no denying that those brothers had penetration. Emma remembered what Mr. John Knightley had once said to Emma about Mr. Elton, the caution Mr. John Knightley had given, the conviction Mr. John Knightley had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of Mr. John Knightley character had been there shewn than any Emma had reached Emma. It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving Mr. Elton, in many respects, the very reverse of what Emma had meant and believed Mr. Elton; proud, assuming, conceited; very full of Mr. Elton own claims, and little concerned about the feelings of others. Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay Mr. Elton addresses to Emma had sunk Mr. Elton in Emma opinion. Mr. Elton professions and Mr. Elton proposals did Mr. Elton no service. Emma thought nothing of Mr. Elton attachment, and was insulted by Mr. Elton hopes. Mr. Elton wanted to marry well, and having the arrogance to raise Mr. Elton eyes to Emma, pretended to be in love; but Emma was perfectly easy as to Mr. Elton not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for. There had been no real affection either in Mr. Elton language or manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but Emma could hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less allied with real love. Emma need not trouble Emma to pity Mr. Elton. Mr. Elton only wanted to aggrandise and enrich Mr. Elton; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so easily obtained as Mr. Elton had fancied, Mr. Elton would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty, or with ten. But--that Mr. Elton should talk of encouragement, should consider Emma as aware of Mr. Elton views, accepting Mr. Elton attentions, meaning (in short), to marry him!--should suppose Mr. Elton her equal in connexion or mind!--look down upon Emma friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below Mr. Elton, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy Mr. Elton shewing no presumption in addressing her!-- her!-- was most provoking. Perhaps her!-- was not fair to expect Mr. Elton to feel how very much Mr. Elton was her!-- inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of such equality might prevent Mr. Elton perception of The very want of such equality; but Mr. Elton must know that in fortune and consequence her!-- was greatly Mr. Elton superior. Mr. Elton must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family--and that the Eltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but all the rest of Highbury fortune, from other sources, was such as to make all the rest of Highbury scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make Mr. Elton way as Mr. Elton could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend Mr. Elton to notice but Mr. Elton situation and Mr. Elton civility.-- But Mr. Elton had fancied her in love with Mr. Elton; that evidently must have been Mr. Elton dependence; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that Emma own behaviour to Mr. Elton had been so complaisant and obliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing Emma real motive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying Mr. Elton a very decided favourite. If _Emma_ had so misinterpreted Mr. Elton feelings, Emma had little right to wonder that _Mr. Elton_, with self-interest to blind Mr. Elton, should have mistaken hers. The first error and the worst lay at Emma door. It was foolish, it was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. Emma was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more. "Here have I," said Emma, "actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man. Emma might never have thought of this man but for me; and certainly never would have thought of this man with hope, if I had not assured Emma of this man attachment, for Emma is as modest and humble as I used to think this man. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading Emma not to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and chance. I was introducing Emma into good company, and giving Emma the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have attempted more. But now, Emma, Emma peace is cut up for some time. I have been but half a friend to Emma; and if Emma were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her;--William Coxe--Oh! no, I could not endure William Coxe--a pert young lawyer." Emma stopt to blush and laugh at Emma own relapse, and then resumed a more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be, and must be. The distressing explanation Emma had to make to Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy Emma in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and Emma went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of Emma having blundered most dreadfully. To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under temporary gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy, and of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed, The youth and cheerfulness of morning will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope. Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than Emma had gone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before Emma, and to depend on getting tolerably out of alleviations of the evil. It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with Emma, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint Mr. Elton--that Harriet's nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--and that there could be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except the three principals, and especially for Emma father's being given a moment's uneasiness about it. These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did Emma further service, for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present. The weather was most favourable for Emma; though Christmas Day, Emma could not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had Mr. Woodhouse daughter attempted it, and his daughter was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to freeze, his daughter was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for his daughter on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's absenting himself. It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though his daughter hoped and believed Mr. Elton to be really taking comfort in some society or other, it was very pleasant to have his daughter so well satisfied with her father being all alone in her father own house, too wise to stir out; and to hear her father say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely from them,-- "Ah! Mr. John Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?" These days of confinement would have been, but for his daughter private perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited his daughter brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions; and his had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed his during the rest of his stay at Hartfield. his was always agreeable and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still such an evil hanging over his daughter in the hour of explanation with Harriet, as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.
