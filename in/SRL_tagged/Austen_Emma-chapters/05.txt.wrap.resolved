"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston," said Mr. Knightley, "of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing." "A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing a bad thing?--why so?" "I think they will neither of they do the other any good." "You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying Harriet with a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently we feel!--Not think their will do each other any good! This will certainly be the beginning of one of we quarrels about Emma, Mr. Knightley." "Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle." "Weston would undoubtedly support me, if Weston were here, for Weston thinks exactly as I do on the subject. we were speaking of the subject only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate the subject was for Emma, that there should be such a girl in Highbury for Emma to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of a woman own sex, after being used to it all a woman life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. Harriet Smith is not the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see Harriet Smith better informed, it will be an inducement to Harriet Smith to read more Harriet Smith. They will read together. Harriet Smith means it, I know." "Emma has been meaning to read more ever since Emma was twelve years old. I have seen a great many lists of Emma drawing-up at various times of books that Emma meant to read regularly through--and very good lists they were--very well chosen, and very neatly arranged--sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list Emma drew up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it did Emma judgment so much credit, that I preserved her judgment some time; and I dare say Emma may have made out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma. Emma will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade Miss Taylor to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not." "I dare say," replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "that I thought so _then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting to do any thing I wished." "There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,"--said Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. "But I," he soon added, "who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must still see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of Emma family. At ten years old, Emma had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled Emma sister at seventeen. Emma was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since Emma was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In Emma mother Emma lost the only person able to cope with Emma. Emma inherits her mother's talents, and must have been under subjection to Emma." "I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_ recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held." "Yes," said he, smiling. "You are better placed _here_; very fit for a wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing you all to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from _Emma_, on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor." "Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to Mr. Knightley." "Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague his son." "I hope not _that_.--It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not foretell vexation from that quarter." "Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma's genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, his son may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think Harriet Smith the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. Harriet Smith knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. Harriet Smith is a flatterer in all Harriet Smith ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned. Harriet Smith ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine Emma has any thing to learn Emma, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _Emma_ cannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put Emma out of conceit with all the other places Emma belongs to. Emma will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed Emma home. I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt a girl rationally to the varieties of a girl situation in life.--They only give a little polish." "I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more anxious for Emma present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance. How well Emma looked last night!" "Oh! you would rather talk of Emma person than Emma mind, would you? Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty." "Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?" "I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial old friend." "Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure! There is health, not merely in Emma bloom, but in Emma air, Emma head, Emma glance. One hears sometimes of a child being 'the picture of health;' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health. Emma is loveliness itself. Emma, is not Emma?" "I have not a fault to find with Emma person," her person replied. "I think Emma all you describe. I love to look at Emma; and I will add this praise, that I do not think Emma personally vain. Considering how very handsome Emma is, Emma appears to be little occupied with it; Emma vanity lies another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread of it doing them both harm." "And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of it not doing them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, Emma is an excellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; Emma has qualities which may be trusted; Emma will never lead any one really wrong; Emma will make no lasting blunder; where all dear Emma errs once, Emma is in the right a hundred times." "Very well; I will not plague you any more. all dear Emma shall be an angel, and I will keep my spleen to all dear Emma till Christmas brings John and Isabella. John loves all dear Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as John does; except when John is not quite frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having the children opinions with all dear Emma." "I know that you all love Emma really too well to be unjust or unkind; but excuse me, Emma, if I take the liberty (I consider all dear Emma, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that all dear Emma's mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be expected that all dear Emma, accountable to nobody but all dear Emma father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to all dear Emma. It has been so many years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office." "Not at all," cried he; "I am much obliged to you for it. It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found; for it shall be attended to." "Emma is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about her sister." "Be satisfied," said he, "I will not raise any outcry. I will keep my ill-humour to you. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella does not seem more her sister; has never excited a greater interest; perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of Emma!" "So do I," said Mrs. Weston gently, "very much." "Mrs. Weston always declares Mrs. Weston will never marry, which, of course, means just nothing at all. But I have no idea that Mrs. Weston has yet ever seen a man Mrs. Weston cared for. It would not be a bad thing for Mrs. Weston to be very much in love with a proper object. I should like to see all dear Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do all dear Emma good. But there is nobody hereabouts to attach all dear Emma; and all dear Emma goes so seldom from home." "There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt all dear Emma to break all dear Emma resolution at present," said Mrs. Weston, "as can well be; and while all dear Emma is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish all dear Emma to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account. I do not recommend matrimony at present to all dear Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you." Part of all dear Emma meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of all dear Emma own and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes at Randalls respecting all dear Emma's destiny, but it was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition which Emma soon afterwards made to "What does Weston think of the weather; shall we have rain?" convinced all dear Emma that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield.
