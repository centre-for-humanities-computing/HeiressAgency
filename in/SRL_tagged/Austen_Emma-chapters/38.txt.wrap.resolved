No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached, The day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank Churchill, in all the certainty of Frank Churchill own self, reached Randalls before dinner, and every thing was safe. No second meeting had there yet been between Frank Churchill and Emma. The room at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in Mr. Weston entreaties for Mr. Weston arriving there as soon as possible after him and Emma, for the purpose of taking Mr. Weston opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came, that Mr. Weston could not refuse Mr. Weston, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company. Mr. Weston was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just sufficiently before they. Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though Frank Churchill did not say much, Frank Churchill eyes declared that Frank Churchill meant to have a delightful evening. They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize. "So unreasonably early!" Emma was going to exclaim; but Emma presently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like Emma, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection. Emma perceived that Emma taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity. Emma liked his open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness would have made his a higher character.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man what a man ought to be.-- Emma could fancy such a man. The whole party walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though _May_, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant. Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger. privy councillors had stopped at Mrs. Bates's door to offer the use of privy councillors carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons. Frank was standing by Emma, but not steadily; there was a restlessness, which shewed a mind not at ease. Frank was looking about, Frank was going to Mrs. Bates's door, Frank was watching for the sound of other carriages,--impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near Emma. Mrs. Elton was spoken of. "I think Emma must be here soon," said Frank. "I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of Emma. It cannot be long, I think, before Emma comes." A carriage was heard. Frank was on the move immediately; but coming back, said, "I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with Emma. I have never seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward." Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed. "But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!" said Mr. Weston, looking about. "Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax thought you were to bring them." The mistake had been slight. A carriage was sent for them now. Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton was affected by the studied elegance of Emma dress, and Emma smiles of graciousness. Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton was immediately qualifying Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton to form an opinion, by giving Emma very proper attention, after the introduction had passed. In a few minutes A carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.-- "I will see that there are umbrellas, sir," said Frank to Frank father: "Miss Bates must not be forgotten:" and away Frank went. Mr. Weston was following; but Mrs. Elton detained Frank, to gratify Frank by Mr. Weston opinion of Frank son; and so briskly did Mr. Weston begin, that the young man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing. "A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him.--You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him.--You a very handsome young man, and him.--You manners are precisely what I like and approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism. You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies-- quite a horror of them. them were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither them had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with Selina, who is mild almost to a fault much better." While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; but when she got to Maple Grove, his could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away. Mrs. Elton turned to Mr. Weston. "I have no doubt of its being we carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. we coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.-- What a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!-- I understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_." Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much Mrs. Elton duty as Mr. Weston's to receive them. Mrs. Elton gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but Emma words, every body's words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not finished Mrs. Elton speech under many minutes after Mrs. Elton being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door opened Mrs. Elton was heard, "So very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not care for Mrs. Elton. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares-- Well!--(as soon as Mrs. Elton was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!-- Jane, Jane, look!--did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin's lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know Good Mrs. Stokes own room again. I saw Good Mrs. Stokes as I came in; Good Mrs. Stokes was standing in the entrance. 'Oh! Good Mrs. Stokes,' said I--but I had not time for more." Good Mrs. Stokes was now met by Mrs. Weston.-- "Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear it. So afraid you might have a headache!--seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to dear Mrs. Elton for the carriage!--excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.-- Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. dear Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or our should have been.-- But two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, 'Upon my word, ma'am--.' Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made my mother take my mother shawl--for the evenings are not warm--my mother large new shawl-- Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of my mother to think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice. There were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. Jane, are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--and there was a mat to step upon--I shall never forget Mr. Frank Churchill extreme politeness.--Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never came out again. my mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not my mother, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?-- Ah! here's Miss Mr. Woodhouse, how do you do?-- Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in fairy-land!-- Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Mr. Woodhouse, you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are a judge.-- Emma did it all Emma. Quite wonderful how Emma does Emma hair!-- No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare--and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.--How do you do? How do you do?--Very well, I thank you. This is delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?-- Oh! there Mr. Frank Churchill is. Don't disturb Mr. Frank Churchill. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through the town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do? How do you all do?--Quite well, I am much obliged to Mr. George and Mr.. Never better.-- Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for Mr. Richard?--I--never take coffee.--A little tea if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!" Frank Churchill returned to Frank Churchill station by Emma; and as soon as "Miss Bates was quiet, Emma found Emma necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind her.--He was thoughtful. Whether Frank Churchill were overhearing too, Emma could not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on Jane dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented Mrs. Elton--and it was, "How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?-- How has Frank Churchill done my hair?"--with many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, "Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon Mr. Richard?--I, and in compliment to the Westons--who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish to be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.-- So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall see if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill. I like Frank Churchill very well." At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not but imagine Frank had overheard Frank own praises, and did not want to hear more;--and the voices of the young ladies were drowned for a while, till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly forward.--Mr. Mrs. Elton had just joined them, and Mrs. Elton wife was exclaiming, "Oh! you have found them out at last, have you, in them seclusion?-- I was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of them." "Jane!"--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure.-- "That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I suppose." "How do you like Mrs. Elton?" said Emma in a whisper. "Not at all." "You are ungrateful." "Ungrateful!--What do you mean?" Then changing from a frown to a smile--"No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.-- Where is my father?--When are them to begin dancing?" Emma could hardly understand my father?--When; my father?--When seemed in an odd humour. my father?--When walked off to find my father?--When , but was quickly back again with both Mr. and Mr. Weston. my father?--When had met with Mr. and Mrs. Weston in a little perplexity, which must be laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mr. Weston that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that Mrs. Elton would expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude. "And what are we to do for a proper partner for Mrs. Elton?" said Mr. Weston. "Mrs. Elton will think Frank ought to ask Mrs. Elton." Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim Mrs. Elton former promise; and boasted Frank an engaged man, which his father looked his father most perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mr. Weston was wanting _Frank_ to dance with Mrs. Elton, and that their business was to help to persuade Frank into it, which was done pretty soon.-- Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Mr. Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though Emma had always considered the ball as peculiarly for Emma. It was almost enough to make Emma think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though Mrs. Elton had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, Mrs. Elton could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston might be Mr. Weston son's superior.-- In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that Emma had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.-- Emma was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancing than by any thing else.--There Mr. Knightley was, among the standers-by, where Mr. Knightley ought not to be; Mr. Knightley ought to be dancing,--not classing Mr. Knightley with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till the husbands rubbers were made up,--so young as Mr. Knightley looked!-- Mr. Knightley could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere, than where Mr. Knightley had placed Mr. Knightley. Mr. Knightley tall, firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, excepting Emma own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner, with what natural grace, Mr. Knightley must have danced, would Mr. Knightley but take the trouble.--Whenever Emma caught Mr. Knightley eye, Emma forced Mr. Knightley to smile; but in general Mr. Knightley was looking grave. Emma wished Mr. Knightley could love a ballroom better, and could like Frank better.-- Mr. Knightley seemed often observing Emma. Emma must not flatter Emma that Mr. Knightley thought of Emma dancing, but if Mr. Knightley were criticising Emma behaviour, Emma did not feel afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between Emma and Emma partner. They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That Frank Churchill thought less of Emma than Frank Churchill had done, was indubitable. The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant attentions of Mr. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;--and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mrs. Elton sauntering about. Mrs. Elton would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided: Harriet was sure Mrs. Elton would not--and Harriet was expecting Mrs. Elton every moment to escape into the card-room. Escape, however, was not Mrs. Elton plan. Mrs. Elton came to the part of the room where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front of some, as if to shew Mrs. Elton liberty, and Mrs. Elton resolution of maintaining it. Mrs. Elton did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.-- Emma saw it. Emma was not yet dancing; Emma was working Emma way up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning Emma head a little Emma saw it all. When Emma was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind Emma, and Emma would no longer allow Emma eyes to watch; but Mrs. Elton was so near, that Emma heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between Mrs. Elton and Mr. Weston; and Emma perceived that Mrs. Elton wife, who was standing immediately above Emma, was not only listening also, but even encouraging Mrs. Elton by significant glances.--The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left gentle Mrs. Weston seat to join Mrs. Elton and say, "Do not you dance, Mrs. Elton?" to which Mrs. Elton prompt reply was, "Most readily, Mr. Weston, if you will dance with Mrs. Elton." "Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than Mrs. Elton. I am no dancer." "If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance," said Mrs. Gilbert, "I shall have great pleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel Mrs. Elton rather an old married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert." "Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith." "Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging-- and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over, Mr. Weston. You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your command--but my dancing days are over." Mr. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification Emma must be returning to her seat. This was Mrs. Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.-- Emma looked round for a moment; Mr. Elton.-- had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging Mr. Elton.-- for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between Mr. Elton.-- and Mr. Elton.-- . Emma would not look again. Emma heart was in a glow, and Emma feared Emma face might be as hot. In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Mr. Knightley leading Harriet to the set!--Never had Emma been more surprized, seldom more delighted, than at that instant. Emma was all pleasure and gratitude, both for Harriet and Emma, and longed to be thanking him; and though too distant for speech, Emma countenance said much, as soon as Emma could catch him again. him dancing proved to be just what Emma had believed His dancing, extremely good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if His dancing had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which Emma happy features announced. It was not thrown away on Emma, Emma bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles. Mrs. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very foolish. Emma did not think Mrs. Elton was quite so hardened as his wife, though growing very like her;--_she_ spoke some of Emma feelings, by observing audibly to Emma partner, "Mr. Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured, I declare." Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment, without interruption, till Miss Bates being seated at table and taking up Miss Bates spoon. "Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet. Mr. Weston begs you to put on your tippet. Mr. Weston says Mr. Weston is afraid there will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done--One door nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane, indeed you must. Frank Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!--so gratified! Excellent dancing indeed!-- Yes, My dear Jane, I ran home, as I said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me.--I set off without saying a word, just as I told you. Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples and wine before Grandmama came away: amazing luck in some of Grandmama throws: and Grandmama inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused, and who were your partners. 'Oh!' said I, 'I shall not forestall My dear Jane; I left My dear Jane dancing with Mr. George Otway; My dear Jane will love to tell you all about it My dear Jane to-morrow: My dear Jane first partner was Mrs. Elton, I do not know who will ask My dear Jane next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' Sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, My dear Jane on one arm, and me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is going; Mrs. Elton, how elegant Mrs. Elton looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in Mrs. Elton train. Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, My dear Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling you of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.-- The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus--so Mrs. Elton was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of it getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much concerned!--Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since-- Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere, so that My dear Jane is not in a draught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence. Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Frank Churchill--only it seems too good--but just as you please. What you direct in this house cannot be wrong. My dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning." Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited Mr. Knightley irresistibly to come to Emma and be thanked. Mr. Knightley was warm in Mr. Knightley reprobation of Mrs. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of censure. "They aimed at wounding more than Harriet," said Mr. Knightley. "Emma, why is it that they are your enemies?" Mr. Knightley looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added, "_She_ ought not to be angry with Emma, I suspect, whatever Mr. Knightley may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that you did want Mr. Knightley to marry Harriet." "I did," replied Emma, "and they cannot forgive me." Mr. Knightley shook Mr. Knightley head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and Mr. Knightley only said, "I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections." "Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong?" "Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it." "I do own Mr. Knightley to have been completely mistaken in Mrs. Elton. There is a littleness about Mrs. Elton which you discovered, and which I did not: and I was fully convinced of Mrs. Elton being in love with Harriet. It was through a series of strange blunders!" "And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice to say, that you would have chosen for Mrs. Elton better than Mrs. Elton has chosen for himself.--Harriet Miss Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl--infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected." Emma was extremely Emma were interrupted by the bustle of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again. "Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?-- Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy! Every body is asleep!" "I am ready," said Emma, "whenever I am wanted." "Whom are you going to dance with?" asked Mr. Knightley. Emma hesitated a moment, and then replied, "With you, if you will ask me." "Will you?" said he, offering he hand. "Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper." "Brother and sister! no, indeed."
