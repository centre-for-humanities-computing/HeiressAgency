Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations, that Mr. Elton himself, is sure of being kindly spoken of. A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first mentioned in Highbury, before Miss Hawkins was, by some means or other, discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant, highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in Mr. Elton himself happy prospects, and circulate the fame of Miss Hawkins merits, there was very little more for Mr. Elton himself to do, than to tell Miss Hawkins Christian name, and say whose music Miss Hawkins principally played. Mr. Elton himself returned, a very happy man. Mr. Elton himself had gone away rejected and mortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what appeared to Mr. Elton himself strong encouragement; and not only losing the right lady, but finding Mr. Elton himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. Mr. Elton himself had gone away deeply offended--Mr. Elton himself came back engaged to another--and to another as superior, of course, to the first, as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. Mr. Elton himself came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith. The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune, of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of some dignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; Mr. Elton himself had not thrown Mr. Elton himself away--Mr. Elton himself had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts; and Mr. Elton himself had gained the lady with such delightful rapidity--the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice; the history which Mr. Elton himself had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious--the steps so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's, and the party at Mrs. Brown's--smiles and blushes rising in importance-- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered--the lady had been so easily impressed--so sweetly disposed--had in short, to use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have Mr. Elton himself, that vanity and prudence were equally contented. Mr. Elton himself had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection, and was just the happy man Mr. Elton himself ought to be; talking only of Mr. Elton himself and Mr. Elton himself own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be laughed at--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, Mr. Elton himself would have been more cautiously gallant. The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and when Mr. Elton himself set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict, that when Mr. Elton himself next entered Highbury Mr. Elton himself would bring Mr. Elton himself bride. During Mr. Elton himself present short stay, Emma had barely seen Mr. Elton himself; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give Emma the impression of Mr. Elton himself not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension, now spread over Mr. Elton himself air. Emma was, in fact, beginning very much to wonder that Emma had ever thought Mr. Elton himself pleasing at all; and Mr. Elton himself sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to Emma own mind, Emma would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing Mr. Elton himself again. Emma wished Mr. Elton himself very well; but Mr. Elton himself gave Emma pain, and Mr. Elton himself welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction. The pain of Mr. Elton himself continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly be lessened by Mr. Elton himself marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be prevented--many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would be an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civility again. Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. Emma was good enough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury-- handsome enough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side. As to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, his had done nothing. On that article, truth seemed attainable. _What_ Emma was, must be uncertain; but _who_ Emma was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not appear that Emma was at all Harriet's superior. Emma brought no name, no blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol--merchant, of course, Miss Hawkins must be called; but, as the whole of the profits of Miss Hawkins mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity of Miss Hawkins line of trade had been very moderate also. Part of every winter Emma had been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol-- was Emma home, the very heart of Bristol--; for though the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--in the law line--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of an uncle, than that an uncle was in the law line; and with an uncle the daughter had lived. Emma guessed an uncle to be the drudge of some attorney, and too stupid to rise. And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was _very_ _well_ _married_, to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_, near Bristol, who kept two carriages! That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins. Could Emma but have given Harriet Emma feelings about it all! Emma had talked Emma into love; but, alas! Emma was not so easily to be talked out of love. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet's mind was not to be talked away. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet's mind might be superseded by another; The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet's mind certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else, Emma feared, would cure Emma. Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always in love. And now, poor girl! Harriet was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton. Harriet was always having a glimpse of Mr. Elton somewhere or other. Harriet saw Mr. Elton only once; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with Mr. Elton, or _just_ to miss Mr. Elton, _just_ to hear Mr. Elton voice, or see Mr. Elton shoulder, _just_ to have something occur to preserve Mr. Elton in Harriet fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture. Harriet was, moreover, perpetually hearing about Mr. Elton; for, excepting when at Hartfield, Harriet was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of Mr. Elton concerns; and every report, therefore, every guess--all that had already occurred, all that might occur in the arrangement of Mr. Elton affairs, comprehending income, servants, and furniture, was continually in agitation around Harriet. Harriet regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of Mr. Elton, and Harriet regrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness, and continual observation of, how much Mr. Elton seemed attached!--his air as Mr. Elton walked by the house--the very sitting of Mr. Elton hat, being all in proof of how much Mr. Elton was in love! Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to Harriet friend, or reproach to her friend, in the waverings of Harriet's mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other. Mr. Elton's engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of Mr. Elton's engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards. Harriet had not been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for Harriet, written in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a great deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton appeared, Harriet had been much occupied by Mr. Elton himself appeared, continually pondering over what could be done in return, and wishing to do more than Harriet dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, in person, had driven away all such cares. While Mr. Elton staid, the Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of Mr. Elton setting off for Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned, judged it best for Emma to return Elizabeth Martin's visit. How Elizabeth Martin's visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--and what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration. Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would be ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!-- After much thinking, Harriet could determine on nothing better, than Harriet's returning Elizabeth Martin's visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding, should convince they that it was to be only a formal acquaintance. Harriet meant to take Harriet in the carriage, leave Harriet at the Abbey Mill, while Harriet drove a little farther, and call for Harriet again so soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future. Harriet could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it which Harriet own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude, merely glossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?
