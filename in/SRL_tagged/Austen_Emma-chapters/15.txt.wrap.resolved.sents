Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for Mr. Woodhouse tea; and when Mr. Woodhouse had drank his tea Mr. Woodhouse was quite ready to go home; and his tea was as much as Mr. Woodhouse three companions could do, to entertain away Mr. Woodhouse notice of the lateness of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared.
Mr. Weston was chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation.
Mr. Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in.
Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa.
He joined Mrs. Weston and Emma immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated He between Mrs. Weston and Emma.
Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded Emma mind by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget Mr. Frank Churchill late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with He as before, and on He making Harriet He very first subject, was ready to listen with most friendly smiles.
He professed He extremely anxious about Harriet fair friend--Harriet fair, lovely, amiable friend.
"Did Harriet know?--had Harriet heard any thing about Harriet, since their being at Randalls?--he felt much anxiety--He must confess that the nature of Harriet complaint alarmed He considerably."
And in this style He talked on for some time very properly, not much attending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with He.
But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if He were more afraid of it being a bad sore throat on Harriet account, than on Harriet's--more anxious that Harriet should escape the infection, than that there should be no infection in the complaint.
He began with great earnestness to entreat Harriet to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber again, for the present--to entreat Harriet to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till He had seen Mr. Perry and learnt Mr. Perry opinion; and though Harriet tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into the subject proper course, there was no putting an end to He extreme solicitude about Harriet.
Harriet was vexed.
It did appear--there was no concealing It--exactly like the pretence of being in love with Harriet, instead of Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!
and Harriet had difficulty in behaving with temper.
He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore Mrs. Weston assistance, "Would not Mrs. Weston give He Mrs. Weston support?--would not Mrs. Weston add Mrs. Weston persuasions to He, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder had no infection?
He could not be satisfied without a promise--would not Mrs. Weston give He Mrs. Weston influence in procuring it?"
"So scrupulous for others," He continued, "and yet so careless for Mrs. Weston!
Mrs. Weston wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat Mrs. Weston.
Is this fair, Mrs.
Weston?--Judge between us.
Have not I some right to complain?
I am sure of your kind support and aid."
Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of first interest in Emma; and as for Emma, Emma was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose.
Emma could only give himself a look; but it was such a look as Emma thought must restore himself to himself senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a seat by Emma sister, and giving Emma all Emma attention.
Emma had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse: "This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir.
Something new for your coachman and horses to be making your coachman and horses way through a storm of snow."
Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized, and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer.
Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer Mr. Woodhouse and turn Mr. Woodhouse attention from Mr. Woodhouse son-in-law, who was pursuing Mr. Woodhouse triumph rather unfeelingly.
"I admired your resolution very much, sir," said sir, "in venturing out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.
Every body must have seen snow coming on.
I admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well.
Another hour or two's snow can hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand.
I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight."
Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that Mr. Weston had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for Mr. Woodhouse hurrying away.
As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; Mr. Woodhouse was afraid their would find no difficulty.
Mr. Woodhouse wished the road might be impassable, that Mr. Woodhouse might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body, calling on Mr. Woodhouse wife to agree with Mr. Woodhouse, that with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged, which his wife hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.
"What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?"
was Mr. Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that Mr. Woodhouse could say for some time.
To his wife Mr. Woodhouse looked for comfort; and his wife assurances of safety, his wife representation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of their having so many friends about their, revived Mr. Woodhouse a little.
Mr. Woodhouse eldest daughter's alarm was equal to Mr. Woodhouse own.
The horror of being blocked up at Randalls, while His eldest daughter children were at Hartfield, was full in His eldest daughter imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, His eldest daughter was eager to have the road settled, that His eldest daughter father and Emma should remain at Randalls, while His eldest daughter and His eldest daughter husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede she and her husband.
"You had better order the carriage directly, my love," said His eldest daughter; "I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk.
I am not at all afraid.
I should not mind walking half the way.
I could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold."
"Indeed!"
replied he.
"Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing does give you cold.
Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home, I dare say.
It will be bad enough for the horses."
my dear Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for my dear Isabella approbation of the plan.
Mrs. Weston could only approve.
my dear Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away; and their were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had left the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow, came back again, and told their that his had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever their liked it, either now or an hour hence.
his had gone beyond the sweep--some way along the Highbury road--the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep--in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of the clouds being soon over.
his had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with his in there being nothing to apprehend.
To my dear Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and the relief of such tidings were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on Emma father's account, who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for his while his continued at Randalls.
his was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home, but no assurances could convince his that it was safe to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending, Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus-- "Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?"
"I am ready, if the others are."
"Shall I ring the bell?"
"Yes, do."
And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for.
A few minutes more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.
The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the discovery of a much darker night than his had been prepared for.
"his was afraid they should have a very bad drive.
his was afraid my dear Isabella my dear Isabella would not like my dear Isabella.
And there would be poor Emma in The carriage.
his did not know what they had best do.
they must keep as much together as they could;" and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very slow and wait for The carriage.
my dear Isabella stept in after Your father; John Knightley, forgetting that John Knightley did not belong to their party, stept in after John Knightley very naturally; so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on he did not belong to their party, and that he did not belong to their party were to have a tete-a-tete drive.
It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment, It would have been rather a pleasure, previous to the suspicions of this very day; Emma could have talked to John Knightley of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but one.
But now, Emma would rather it had not happened.
Emma believed John Knightley had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that John Knightley would want to be talking nonsense.
To restrain John Knightley as much as might be, by Emma own manners, Emma was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night; but scarcely had Emma begun, scarcely had they passed the sweep-gate and joined The carriage, than Emma found Emma subject cut up--Emma hand seized--Emma attention demanded, and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to Emma: availing Mr. Elton of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well known, hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if Emma refused Mr. Elton; but flattering Mr. Elton that Mr. Elton ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible.
It really was so.
Without scruple--without apology--without much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing Mr. Elton _Harriet_ lover.
Harriet tried to stop Mr. Elton; but vainly; Mr. Elton would go on, and say it all.
Angry as Harriet was, the thought of the moment made Harriet resolve to restrain Harriet when Harriet did speak.
Harriet felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that half this folly might belong only to the passing hour.
Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, which Harriet hoped would best suit his half and half state, Harriet replied, "I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton.
This to _me_!
you forget yourself--you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please."
"Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly mean!"
-- And Smith!--What could she possibly mean!"
-- repeated she words with such assurance of accent, such boastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness, "Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct!
and I can account for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner.
Command yourself enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget no."
But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate Mr. Elton spirits, not at all to confuse Mr. Elton intellects.
Mr. Elton perfectly knew Mr. Elton own meaning; and having warmly protested against she suspicion as most injurious, and slightly touched upon Mr. Elton respect for Miss Smith Smith as she friend,--but acknowledging Mr. Elton wonder that Miss Smith Smith should be mentioned at all,--he resumed the subject of Mr. Elton own passion, and was very urgent for a favourable answer.
As she thought less of Mr. Elton inebriety, she thought more of Mr. Elton inconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied, "It is impossible for me to doubt any longer.
You have made yourself too clear.
Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express.
After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing--to be addressing me in this manner--this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!
Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such professions."
"Good Heaven!"
cried Mr. Elton, "what can be the meaning of this?-- Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence--never paid this?-- Miss Smith!--I any attentions, but as your friend: never cared whether this?-- Miss Smith!--I were dead or alive, but as your friend.
If this?-- Miss Smith!--I has fancied otherwise, this?-- Miss Smith!--I own wishes have misled this?-- Miss Smith!--I, and I am very sorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh!
Miss Woodhouse!
who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near!
No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character.
I have thought only of you.
I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else.
Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself.
You cannot really, seriously, doubt it.
No!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me."
It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--which of all Emma unpleasant sensations was uppermost.
Emma was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, Mr. Elton tried to take Emma hand again, as Mr. Elton joyously exclaimed-- "Charming Miss Woodhouse!
allow me to interpret this interesting silence.
It confesses that you have long understood me."
"No, sir," cried Emma, "it confesses no such thing.
So far from having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views, till this moment.
As to sir, I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings-- Nothing could be farther from my wishes--your attachment to my friend Harriet--your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that her were not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent.
Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought seriously of her?"
"Never, madam," cried he, affronted in he turn: "never, I assure you.
_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl; and I should be happy to see girl respectably settled.
I wish girl extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object to--Every body has men who might not object level: but as for sir, I am not, I think, quite so much at a loss.
I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance, as to be addressing sir to Miss Smith!-- No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement I received--" "Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it.
I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend.
In no other light could you have been more to sir than a common acquaintance.
I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake ends where the mistake does.
Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware, probably, any more than sir, of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of.
But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting.
I have no thoughts of matrimony at present."
Miss Smith was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer, for the fears of Miss Woodhouse had confined they to a foot-pace.
If there had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate awkwardness; but they straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment.
Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when the carriage stopped, they found they, all at once, at the door of his house; and his was out before another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable to wish his a good night.
The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to Hartfield.
There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by she father, who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--and in strange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it seemed as if she return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr. John Knightley, ashamed of Mr. John Knightley ill-humour, was now all kindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of she , as to seem--if not quite ready to join Mr. John Knightley in a basin of gruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party, except herself.--But she mind had never been in such perturbation; and its needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed she the relief of quiet reflection.
