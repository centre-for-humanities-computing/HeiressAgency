Mr. Knightley might quarrel with Mr. Knightley, but Emma could not quarrel with Emma. Mr. Knightley was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before Mr. Knightley came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, Mr. Knightley grave looks shewed that Emma was not forgiven. Emma was sorry, but could not repent. On the contrary, Emma plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to Emma by the general appearances of the next few days. The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr. Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room, Mr. Elton got up to look at the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room, and sighed out Mr. Elton half sentences of admiration just as Mr. Elton ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they were visibly forming they into as strong and steady an attachment as Harriet youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as Mr. Martin furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter. Emma views of improving Emma little friend's mind, by a great deal of useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let Emma imagination range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge Emma comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision Emma was making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that Emma could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by Emma friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies. In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it from Mrs. Goddard, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many more. Emma assisted with Emma invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity. Miss Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth the girls putting in. "So many clever riddles as there used to be when Miss Woodhouse was young--Miss Woodhouse wondered Miss Woodhouse could not remember So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young! but Miss Woodhouse hoped Miss Woodhouse should in time." And it always ended in "Kitty, a fair but frozen maid." Miss Woodhouse good friend Perry, too, whom Miss Woodhouse had spoken to on the subject, did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but Miss Woodhouse had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as Miss Woodhouse went about so much, something, Miss Woodhouse thought, might come from that quarter. It was by no means Mr. Elton. Mr. Elton was the only one whose assistance Mr. Elton asked. Mr. Elton was invited to contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that Mr. Elton might recollect; and Mr. Elton had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Elton most intently at work with Mr. Elton recollections; and at the same time, as Mr. Elton could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass Mr. Elton lips. They owed to Mr. Elton They two or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last Mr. Elton recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade, My first doth affliction denote, Which my second is destin'd to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal.-- made Mr. Elton quite sorry to acknowledge that They had transcribed it some pages ago already. "Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?" said Mr. Elton; "that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to you." "Oh no! Mr. Elton had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in Mr. Elton life. Mr. Elton! Mr. Elton was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse"--he stopt a moment--"or Miss Smith could inspire Mr. Elton." The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. Mr. Elton called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing, as Mr. Elton said, a charade, which a friend of Mr. Elton had addressed to a young lady, the object of Mr. Elton admiration, but which, from Mr. Elton manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be Mr. Elton own. "I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection," said Mr. Elton. "Being my friend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it." The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could understand. There was deep consciousness about him, and him found deep consciousness about him easier to meet Emma eye than Emma friend's. him was gone the next moment:--after another moment's pause, "Take it," said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards Harriet--"it is for you. Take your own." But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it Harriet. To Miss-- CHARADE. My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings, Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease. Another view of man, my second brings, Behold him there, the monarch of the seas! But ah! united, what reverse we have! Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown; Lord of the earth and sea, Another view of man, my second brings, Behold him there, the monarch of the seas bends a slave, And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone. Thy ready wit the word will soon supply, May its approval beam in that soft eye! Harriet cast Harriet eye over her eye, pondered, caught the meaning, read the meaning through again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then passing the meaning to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to Harriet, while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness, "Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse charades. _Courtship_--a very good hint. I give you credit for credit. This is feeling your way. This is saying very plainly--'Pray, Miss Smith, give me leave to pay my addresses to Harriet. Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance.' May its approval beam in that soft eye! Harriet. Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets, the justest that could be given. Thy ready wit the word will soon supply. Humph--Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much in love, indeed, to describe Harriet so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade indeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon now. Harriet was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations, which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the eagerness of Harriet's wondering questions. "What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--I cannot guess an idea in the least. What can an idea possibly be? Do try to find an idea out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could be the young lady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman? And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone. Can it be Neptune? Behold Behold there, the monarch of the seas! Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one syllable. It must be very clever, or Behold would not have brought It. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find It out?" "Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! Harriet, what are you thinking of? Where would be the use of Behold bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen. For Miss Woodhouse ------, read Miss Smith. My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings, Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease. That is _court_. Another view of man, my second brings; Behold man there, the monarch of the seas! That is _ship_;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream. But ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have! Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown. Lord of the earth and sea, That bends a slave, And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone. A very proper compliment!--and then follows the application, which I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of it being written for you and to yourself." Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. Harriet read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. Harriet could not speak. But Harriet was not wanted to speak. It was enough for Harriet to feel. Emma spoke for Emma. "There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment," said Harriet, "that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions. You are his object--and you will soon receive the completest proof of his object. I thought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened. I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural. an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural probability and an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural eligibility have really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing but good. This will give you every thing that you want--consideration, independence, a proper home--This will fix you in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us." "Dear Miss Woodhouse!"--and "Dear Miss Woodhouse," was all HarrietHarriet, with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear to her friend that her saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as her ought. Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment. "Whatever you say is always right," cried Harriet, "and therefore I suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not have imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton, who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him_. He is so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses--'To Miss ------.' Dear me, how clever!--Could it really be meant for me?" "I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by matter-of-fact prose." "It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure, a month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do take place!" "When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons do indeed--and really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement of other people, should so immediately shape the pre-arrangement of other people into the proper form. You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction, and sends love into the very channel where love ought to flow. The course of true love never did run smooth-- A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage." "That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people, who did not know Mr. Elton, to speak to Mr. Elton, at Michaelmas! And Mr. Elton, the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to, quite like Mr. Knightley! Mr. Knightley company so sought after, that every body says Mr. Knightley need not eat a single meal by Mr. Knightley if Mr. Knightley does not chuse it; that Mr. Knightley has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts Miss Nash has ever preached from since Miss Nash came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back to the first time I saw Miss Nash! How little did I think!--The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard Miss Nash was going by, and Miss Nash Nash came and scolded we away, and staid to look through Miss Nash; however, Miss Nash called me back presently, and let me look too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought Miss Nash looked! Miss Nash was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole." "This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be, must be agreeable to your friends, provided at least your friends have common sense; and we are not to be addressing we conduct to fools. If they are anxious to see you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will be accomplished; and if they only object is that you should, in the common phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy well_." "Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You understand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other. This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have made any thing like it." "I thought Miss Nash meant to try Miss Nash skill, by Miss Nash manner of declining it yesterday." "I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read." "I never read one more to the purpose, certainly." "It is as long again as almost all we have had before." "I do not consider It length as particularly in It favour. Such things in general cannot be too short." Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in Harriet mind. "It is one thing," said Harriet, presently--Harriet cheeks in a glow--"to have very good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you must, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like this." Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's prose. "Such sweet lines!" continued Harriet--"these two last!--But how shall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found the paper out?--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?" "Leave the paper to Miss Woodhouse. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare say, and then I will give the paper He back, and some nonsense or other will pass between we, and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes shall chuse some nonsense or other own time for beaming. Trust to Miss Woodhouse." "Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good." "Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book." "Oh! but those two lines are"-- --"The best of all. Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for private enjoyment keep those two lines are"-- --"The best of all. those two lines are"-- --"The best of all are not at all the less written you know, because you divide those two lines are"-- --"The best of all. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does The couplet meaning change. But take The couplet away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend upon The couplet, he would not like to have he slighted, much better than he passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or neither. Give me my book, I will write my book down, and then there can be no possible reflection on you." Harriet submitted, though Harriet mind could hardly separate the parts, so as to feel quite sure that Harriet were not writing down a declaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity. "I shall never let my book go out of my own hands," said Harriet. "Very well," replied Emma; "a most natural feeling; and the longer it lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you will not object to my reading this beautiful charademy father. It will be giving my father so much pleasure! my father loves any thing of the sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment. my father has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to my father." Harriet looked grave. "Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.--You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to this charade.--You. Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration. If my father had been anxious for secrecy, my father would not have left the paper while I was by; but my father rather pushed the paper towards my father than towards Harriet. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. my father has encouragement enough to proceed, without us sighing out us souls over this charade." "Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about this charade. Do as you please." Miss Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the recurrence of Miss Woodhouse very frequent inquiry of "Well, my dears, how does my book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?" "Yes, papa; us have something to read you, something quite fresh. A piece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt, us suppose, by a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade, and us have just copied this morning--(dropt in." She read this morning--(dropt to him, just as him liked to have any thing read, slowly and distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every part as She proceeded--and him was very much pleased, and, as She had foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion. "Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Very true. 'Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written so prettily, but you, Emma." Emma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking, and a very tender sigh, he added, "Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother was so clever at all those things! If I had but Your dear mother memory! But I can remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are several. Kitty, a fair but frozen maid, Kindled a flame I yet deplore, The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid, Though of hood-wink'd near approach afraid, So fatal to my suit before. And that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever all the way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it." "Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. our copied it from the Elegant Extracts. it was Garrick's, you know." "Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it. Kitty, a fair but frozen maid. The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for poor Isabella was very near being christened Catherine after poor Isabella grandmama. I hope we shall have poor Isabella here next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put poor Isabella--and what room there will be for the children?" "Oh! yes--poor Isabella will have poor Isabella own room, of course; her own room always has;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual, you know. Why should there be any change?" "I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since my dear was here!--not since last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley's being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly taken away from us all!--and how sorry poor Isabella will be when poor Isabella comes, not to see Miss Taylor here!" "poor Isabella will not be surprized, papa, at least." "I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard poor Isabella was going to be married." "We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with We, while poor Isabella is here." "Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she is coming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing." "It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case of necessity. John Knightley's must be in town again on the 28th, and We ought to be thankful, papa, that We are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey. John Knightley's promises to give up John Knightley's claim this Christmas--though you know it is longer since they were with John Knightley's, than with us." "It would be very hard, indeed, my my dear, if poor Isabella poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield." Miss Woodhouse could never allow for John Knightley's's claims on Miss Woodhouse brother, or any body's claims on poor Isabella, except Miss Woodhouse own. Miss Woodhouse sat musing a little while, and then said, "But I do not see why poor Isabella poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon, though Miss Woodhouse does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade Emma to stay longer with us. Emma and the children might stay very well." "Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do not think you ever will. poor Isabella cannot bear to stay behind poor Isabella husband." This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Miss Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw Miss Woodhouse spirits affected by the idea of Miss Woodhouse daughter's attachment to his daughter , his daughter immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise such a branch of the subject. "Harriet must give us as much of Harriet company as Harriet can while my brother and sister are here. I am sure Harriet will be pleased with the children. us are very proud of the children, are not us, papa? I wonder which Harriet will think the handsomest, Henry or John?" "Aye, I wonder which Harriet will. Poor little dears, how glad Poor little dears will be to come. Poor little dears are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet." "I dare say Poor little dears are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not." "Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like John mama. Henry is the eldest, Henry was named after John, not after Henry father. John, the second, is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that the eldest was not, but poor Isabella would have John called Henry, which I thought very pretty of poor Isabella. And John is a very clever boy, indeed. Some people are all remarkably clever; and Some people have so many pretty ways. Some people will come and stand by my chair, and say, 'Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told Henry knives were only made for grandpapas. I think knives is too rough with knives very often." "Henry appears rough to John," said Emma, "because you are so very gentle Emma; but if you could compare Henry with other papas, you would not think Henry rough. Henry wishes Henry boys to be active and hardy; and if his boys misbehave, can give his boys a sharp word now and then; but Henry is an affectionate father--certainly John Knightley's is an affectionate father. The children are all fond of Henry." "And then The children uncle comes in, and tosses The children up to the ceiling in a very frightful way!" "But The children like it, papa; there is nothing The children like so much. It is such enjoyment to The children, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of The children taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other." "Well, I cannot understand it." "That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other." Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could receive Harriet with the usual smile, and Emma quick eye soon discerned in Harriet the consciousness of having made a push--of having thrown a die; and Emma imagined Harriet was come to see how it might turn up. Harriet ostensible reason, however, was to ask whether Miss Woodhouse's party could be made up in the evening without Harriet, or whether Harriet should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield. If Harriet were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise Harriet friend Cole had been saying so much about Harriet dining with Harriet--had made such a point of it, that Harriet had promised Harriet conditionally to come. Emma thanked Harriet, but could not allow of Harriet disappointing his friend Cole on their account; his father was sure of Harriet rubber. Harriet re-urged--Emma re-declined; and Harriet seemed then about to make Harriet bow, when taking the paper from the table, Emma returned it-- "Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us; thank you for the sight of it. us admired it so much, that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection. his friend Cole will not take it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines." Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. Mr. Elton looked rather doubtingly--rather confused; said something about "honour,"--glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, took the book up, and examined the book very attentively. With the view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said, "You must make my apologies to his friend Cole; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two. his friend Cole may be sure of every woman's approbation while his friend Cole writes with such gallantry." "I have no hesitation in saying," replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating a good deal while Mr. Elton spoke; "I have no hesitation in saying--at least if his friend Cole feels at all as _I_ do--I have not the smallest doubt that, could Mr. Elton see Mr. Elton little effusion honoured as _I_ see his little effusion, (looking at the book again, and replacing his little effusion on the table), Mr. Elton would consider his little effusion as the proudest moment of Mr. Elton life." After this speech Mr. Elton was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think it too soon; for with all Mr. Elton good and agreeable qualities, there was a sort of parade in Mr. Elton speeches which was very apt to incline Emma to laugh. Emma ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.
