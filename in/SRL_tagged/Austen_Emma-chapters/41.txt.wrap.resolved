In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon Hartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use to be made of The Eltons barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at Jane Fairfax grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, Jane Fairfax was likely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least Jane Fairfax were able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in Jane Fairfax service, and save Jane Fairfax from being hurried into a delightful situation against Jane Fairfax will. Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike himself more. himself began to suspect himself of some double dealing in himself pursuit of Emma. Emma Emma was Emma object appeared indisputable. Every thing declared it; himself own attentions, himself father's hints, himself mother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. But while so many were devoting himself to Emma, and Emma Emma making himself over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect Mr. Knightley of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. Mr. Knightley could not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet--Mr. Knightley thought so at least--symptoms of admiration on Mr. Knightley side, which, having once observed, Mr. Knightley could not persuade Mr. Knightley to think entirely void of meaning, however Mr. Knightley might wish to escape any of Emma's errors of imagination. _She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose. Mr. Knightley was dining with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and Mr. Knightley had seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. When Mr. Knightley was again in their company, Mr. Knightley could not help remembering what Mr. Knightley had seen; nor could Mr. Knightley avoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper and Mr. Knightley fire at twilight, "Mr. Knightley creating what I saw," brought Mr. Knightley yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill and Jane. Mr. Knightley had walked up one day after dinner, as Mr. Knightley very often did, to spend Mr. Knightley evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; Mr. Knightley joined Emma and Harriet; and, on returning, Emma and Harriet fell in with a larger party, who, like Emma and Harriet, judged it wisest to take Emma and Harriet exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and Emma and Harriet son, Miss Bates and Emma niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in and drink tea with her father. The Randalls party agreed to The Randalls party immediately; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons listened to, her also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most obliging invitation. As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback. The gentlemen spoke of Mr. Perry horse. "By the bye," said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, "what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up Mr. Perry carriage?" Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, "I did not know that Mr. Perry ever had any such plan." "Nay, I had he ever had any such plan from you. You wrote me word of he ever had any such plan three months ago." "Me! impossible!" "Indeed you did. I remember he ever had any such plan perfectly. You mentioned he ever had any such plan as what was certainly to be very soon. Mr. Perry had told somebody, and was extremely happy about he ever had any such plan. It was owing to _Mr. Perry_ persuasion, as Mr. Perry thought Mr. Perry being out in bad weather did Mr. Perry a great deal of harm. You must remember it now?" "Upon my word I never heard of my word till this moment." "Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could my word be?--Then I must have dreamt my word--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith, you walk as if you were tired. You will not be sorry to find you at home." "What is this?--What is this?" cried Mrs. Weston, "about Mr. Perry and a carriage? Is Mr. Perry going to set up a carriage, Frank? I am glad Mr. Perry can afford it. You had it from Mr. Perry, had you?" "No, sir," replied Mr. Perry son, laughing, "I seem to have had it from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's having mentioned it in one of Mrs. Weston letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all these particulars--but as Mrs. Weston declares Mrs. Weston never heard a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer. I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--and when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry." "It is odd though," observed his father, "that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe. Mr. Perry's setting up a carriage! and Mr. Perry wife's persuading Mr. Perry to it, out of care for Mr. Perry health--just what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little premature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream! And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent. Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?" Emma was out of hearing. Emma had hurried on before Emma guests to prepare Emma for her guests appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr. Weston's hint. "Why, to own the truth," cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes, "if I must speak on this subject, there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not mean to say that Mr. Frank Churchill did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for Emma mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves--but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days. Emma was very anxious that Mr. Frank Churchill should have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because Emma thought Emma had prevailed. Jane, don't you remember grandmama's telling ourselves of grandmama when ourselves got home? I forget where ourselves had been walking to--very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls. Emma was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed I do not know who is not--and Emma had mentioned it to Emma in confidence; Emma had no objection to Emma telling ourselves, of course, but it was not to go beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware. I am Mr. Weston, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it _Jane_ never betrayed the least thing in the world. Where is she?--Oh! just behind. Perfectly remember Emma's coming.-- Extraordinary dream, indeed!" They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face, where Frank Churchill's thought Frank Churchill's saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, Frank Churchill's had involuntarily turned to Jane; but Jane was indeed behind, and too busy with Jane shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let Jane pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching Jane eye--Mr. Knightley seemed watching Jane intently--in vain, however, if it were so-- Jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither. There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take Mr. Knightley seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade Emma to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on which two of Mr. Knightley daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move. "Miss Woodhouse," said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind Frank Churchill, which Frank Churchill could reach as Frank Churchill sat, "have your nephews taken away your nephews alphabets--your nephews box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is It? This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters one morning. I want to puzzle you again." Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves. their were rapidly forming words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the "poor little boys," or in fondly pointing out, as Mr. Weston took up any stray letter near Mr. Weston, how beautifully Emma had written it. Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. Emma gave a slight glance round the table, and applied Emma to it. Frank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them; and it was Mr. Knightley object to see as much as Mr. Knightley could, with as little apparent observation. a word was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight, Jane should have looked on the table instead of looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work. Jane was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to Mr. Knightley for help. a word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible. Mr. Knightley connected it with The dream; but how it could all be, was beyond Mr. Knightley comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion of Mr. Knightley favourite could have been so lain asleep! Mr. Knightley feared there must be some decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet Mr. Knightley at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick. It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill part. With great indignation did Frank Churchill continue to observe Frank Churchill; with great alarm and distrust, to observe also Frank Churchill two blinded companions. Frank Churchill saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to Emma with a look sly and demure. Frank Churchill saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining, though it was something which Emma judged it proper to appear to censure; for Emma said, "Nonsense! for shame!" Frank Churchill heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, "I will give it to Emma--shall I?"--and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth. "No, no, you must not; you shall not, indeed." it was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without feeling, and to recommend Frank Churchill without complaisance, directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated Emma to study it. Mr. Knightley's excessive curiosity to know what the word might be, made Mr. Knightley seize every possible moment for darting Mr. Knightley eye towards it, and it was not long before Mr. Knightley saw it to be _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax's perception seemed to accompany Mr. Knightley; Jane Fairfax's comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. Jane Fairfax's was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing Jane Fairfax's watched, blushed more deeply than Mr. Knightley had ever perceived Jane Fairfax's, and saying only, "I did not know that proper names were allowed," pushed away those five letters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered. Jane Fairfax's face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned towards Jane Fairfax's aunt. "Aye, very true, my dear," cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken a word--"I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. us really must wish you good night." Jane's alertness in moving, proved Jane as ready as her aunt had preconceived. Jane was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but so many were also moving, that Jane could not get away; and Mr. Knightley thought Mr. Knightley saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards Jane, and resolutely swept away by Jane unexamined. Jane was afterwards looking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was looking also--it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell. Mr. Knightley remained at Hartfield after all the rest, Mr. Knightley thoughts full of what Mr. Knightley had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist Mr. Knightley observations, Mr. Knightley must--yes, Mr. Knightley certainly must, as a friend--an anxious friend--give Emma some hint, ask Emma some question. Mr. Knightley could not see Emma in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve Emma. It was Mr. Knightley duty. "Pray, Emma," said Mr. Knightley, "may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw the word, and am curious to know how the word could be so very entertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other." Emma was extremely confused. Emma could not endure to give Mr. Knightley the true explanation; for though Emma suspicions were by no means removed, Emma was really ashamed of having ever imparted them. "Oh!" Emma cried in evident embarrassment, "it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves." "The joke," he replied gravely, "seemed confined to you and Frank Churchill." he had hoped Emma would speak again, but Emma did not. Emma would rather busy Emma about any thing than speak. he sat a little while in doubt. A variety of evils crossed he mind. Interference--fruitless interference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to declare Emma affection engaged. Yet he would speak. he owed it to Emma, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference, rather than Emma welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause. "Emma," said he at last, with earnest kindness, "do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?" "Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.-- Why do you make a doubt of it?" "Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or that her admired he?" "Never, never!" her cried with a most open eagerness--"Never, for the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to her. And how could such an idea possibly come into your head?" "I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them--certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public." "Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--very sorry to check you in your first essay--but indeed it will not do. There is no admiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances--feelings rather of a totally different nature--it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of nonsense in explain:--there--but the part which is capable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that them are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in the world can be. That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I can _answer_ for her side being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman's indifference." her spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which silenced, Mr. Knightley. her was in gay spirits, and would have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet hers. his found his could not be useful, and his feelings were too much irritated for talking. That his might not be irritated into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year, his soon afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.
