A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of Emma agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. Emma was soon convinced that it was not for Emma Emma was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for Frank Churchill. Emma own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing; Her own attachment was not worth thinking of;-- but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of two months should not have cooled he, there were dangers and evils before her:--caution for he and for Emma would be necessary. Emma did not mean to have Emma own affections entangled again, and it would be incumbent on Emma to avoid any encouragement of he. Emma wished Emma might be able to keep he from an absolute declaration. That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance! and yet, Emma could not help rather anticipating something decisive. Emma felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis, an event, a something to alter Emma present composed and tranquil state. It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen, before Emma had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined, but Frank Churchill's was at Highbury very soon afterwards. Frank Churchill's rode down for a couple of hours; Frank Churchill's could not yet do more; but as Frank Churchill's came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, Emma could then exercise all Emma quick observation, and speedily determine how Frank Churchill's was influenced, and how Emma must act. They met with the utmost friendliness. There could be no doubt of Frank Churchill's great pleasure in seeing Emma. But Emma had an almost instant doubt of Frank Churchill's caring for Emma as Frank Churchill's had done, of Frank Churchill's feeling the same tenderness in the same degree. Emma watched Frank Churchill's well. It was a clear thing Frank Churchill's was less in love than Frank Churchill's had been. Absence, with the conviction probably of Emma indifference, had produced this very natural and very desirable effect. Frank Churchill's was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed delighted to speak of Frank Churchill's former visit, and recur to old stories: and Frank Churchill's was not without agitation. It was not in Frank Churchill's calmness that Emma read Frank Churchill's comparative difference. Frank Churchill's was not calm; high spirits were evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about Frank Churchill's. Lively as Frank Churchill's was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy Frank Churchill's; but what decided Emma belief on the subject, was Frank Churchill's staying only a quarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury. "Frank Churchill's had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as Frank Churchill's passed--Frank Churchill's had not stopped, Frank Churchill's would not stop for more than a word--but Frank Churchill's had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if Frank Churchill's did not call, and much as Frank Churchill's wished to stay longer at Hartfield, Frank Churchill's must hurry off." Emma had no doubt as to Frank Churchill's being less in love--but neither Frank Churchill's agitated spirits, nor Frank Churchill's hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and Emma was rather inclined to think a perfect cure implied a dread of Emma returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting Frank Churchill's with Emma long. This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days. Frank Churchill's was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented. Frank Churchill's aunt could not bear to have Frank Churchill's leave His aunt. Such was Frank Churchill's own account at Randall's. If Frank Churchill's were quite sincere, if Frank Churchill's really tried to come, it was to be inferred that Frank Churchill's removal to London had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of Frank Churchill disorder. That Frank Churchill was really ill was very certain; Frank Churchill's had declared Frank Churchill's convinced of she was really ill, at Randalls. Though much might be fancy, Frank Churchill's could not doubt, when Frank Churchill's looked back, that Frank Churchill was in a weaker state of health than Frank Churchill had been half a year ago. Frank Churchill's did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove, or at least that Frank Churchill might not have many years of existence before Frank Churchill; but Frank Churchill's could not be prevailed on, by all Frank Churchill's father's doubts, to say that Frank Churchill complaints were merely imaginary, or that Frank Churchill was as strong as ever. It soon appeared that London was not the place for Frank Churchill. Frank Churchill could not endure It noise. Frank Churchill nerves were under continual irritation and suffering; and by the ten days' end, Frank Churchill nephew's letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to Richmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit expected from a change of plan. Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement, and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before Frank of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--for A ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was taken for May and June. Emma was told that now Frank wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as Frank could even wish. Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. Mr. Weston was considering Emma as the source of all the happiness they offered. Emma hoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof. Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable. Mr. Weston was quite delighted. It was the very circumstance Mr. Weston could have wished for. Now, it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to a young man?--An hour's ride. Mr. Weston would be always coming over. The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing Mr. Weston always and seeing Mr. Weston never. Sixteen miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street--was a serious obstacle. Were Mr. Weston ever able to get away, the day would be spent in coming and returning. There was no comfort in having Mr. Weston in London; Mr. Weston might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse. Better than nearer! One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,--the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before, but It had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now, however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from Frank, to say that Frank aunt felt already much better for the change, and that Frank had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible. Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness. Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to Mr. Woodhouse. May was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and James sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with neither dear little Henry nor dear little John, while dear Emma were gone.
