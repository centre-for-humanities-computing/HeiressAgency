There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning among Mrs. John Knightley old acquaintance with Mrs. John Knightley five children, and talking over what Mrs. John Knightley had done every evening with Mrs. John Knightley father and sister. Mrs. John Knightley had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. It was a delightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short. In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Weston was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party. How they were all to be conveyed, Mr. Weston would have made a difficulty if Mr. Weston could, but as Mr. Weston son and daughter's carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield, Mr. Weston was not able to make more than a simple question on that head; that head hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did that head occupy Emma long to convince Mr. Weston that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also. Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early, as well as the numbers few; Mr. Weston's habits and inclination being consulted in every thing. The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that Mr. Weston should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and Harriet had gone home so much indisposed with a cold, that, but for Harriet own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed Emma to leave the house. Emma called on Emma the next day, and found Emma doom already signed with regard to Randalls. Emma was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded Harriet from this delightful engagement, though Harriet could not speak of Harriet loss without many tears. Emma sat with Emma as long as Emma could, to attend Emma in Mrs. Goddard's unavoidable absences, and raise Emma spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton's would be depressed when Mr. Elton knew Emma state; and left Emma at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of Mr. Elton having a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing Emma very much. Emma had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when Emma was met by Mr. Elton, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid--of whom Mr. Elton, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that Mr. Elton might carry some report of Emma to Hartfield--they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with Mr. Elton two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for. they joined company and proceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of Emma friend's complaint;--"a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about Emma, a quick, low pulse, &c. and Emma was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often alarmed Harriet with Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats." Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as Mr. Elton exclaimed, "A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid infectious sort. Has Perry seen Harriet? Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of her friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks. Why does not Perry see Harriet?" Emma, who was not really at all frightened Harriet, tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which Mrs. Goddard could not wish to reason away, which Mrs. Goddard would rather feed and assist than not, Mrs. Goddard added soon afterwards--as if quite another subject, "It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I should really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father from venturing; but as my father has made up my father mind, and does not seem to feel the cold my father, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse Mr. Elton. You appear to Mr. Elton a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night." Mr. Elton looked as if Mr. Elton did not very well know what answer to make; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of such a fair lady's, Mr. Elton had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--but Emma, too eager and busy in such a fair lady own previous conceptions and views to hear Mr. Elton impartially, or see Mr. Elton with clear vision, was very well satisfied with Mr. Elton muttering acknowledgment of its being "very cold, certainly very cold," and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated Mr. Elton from Randalls, and secured Mr. Elton the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening. "You do quite right," said she;--"we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston." But hardly had Harriet so spoken, when Harriet found Harriet brother was civilly offering a seat in her brother carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's only objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had Mr. Elton broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment; never had Mr. Elton smile been stronger, nor Mr. Elton eyes more exulting than when Mr. Elton next looked at Harriet. "Well," said Harriet to Harriet, "this is most strange!--After I had got Mr. Elton off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe, in many men, especially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining out--a dinner engagement is so high in the class of especially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining out--a dinner engagement pleasures, especially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining out--a dinner engagement employments, especially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining out--a dinner engagement dignities, almost especially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining out--a dinner engagement duties, that any thing gives way to it--and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still, young man cannot refuse an invitation, young man must dine out wherever young man is asked. What a strange thing love is! young man can see ready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for Harriet." Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and Harriet could not but do young man the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in young man manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of young man voice while assuring Harriet that young man should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of Mrs. Goddard fair friend, the last thing before young man prepared for the happiness of meeting Mrs. Goddard again, when young man hoped to be able to give a better report; and young man sighed and smiled young man off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in young man favour. After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began with-- "I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr. Elton. It is downright labour to a man where ladies are concerned. With men a man can be rational and unaffected, but when a man has ladies to please, every feature works." "Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect," replied Emma; "but where there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great deal. Where a man does a man best with only moderate powers, a man will have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value." "Yes," said John Knightley presently, with some slyness, "John Knightley seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you." "Me!" she replied with a smile of astonishment, "are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton's object?" "Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if Such an imagination never occurred to Emma before, you may as well take Such an imagination into consideration now." "Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!" "I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your manners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better look about Emma, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do." "I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I are very good friends, and nothing more;" and she walked on, amusing she in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very well pleased with she brother for imagining she blind and ignorant, and in want of counsel. him said no more. Mr. Weston had so completely made up Mr. Weston mind to the visit, that in spite of the increasing coldness, Mr. Weston seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with Mr. Weston eldest daughter in Mr. Weston own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of Mr. Weston own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding a few flakes of snow way down, and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time. Emma soon saw that Emma companion was not in the happiest humour. The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least, which John Knightley did not by any means like; John Knightley anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by John Knightley in expressing John Knightley discontent. "A man," said A man, "must have a very good opinion of A man when A man asks people to leave people own fireside, and encounter such a day as this, for the sake of coming to see A man. A man must think A man a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest absurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!-- The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home--and the folly of people's not staying comfortably at home when people can! If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;--and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to man view or man feelings, to stay at home man, and keep all under shelter that man can;--here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow. Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than four servants might have had at home." Emma did not find Emma equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the "Very true, my love," which must have been usually administered by he travelling companion; but Emma had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all. Emma could not be complying, Emma dreaded being quarrelsome; Emma heroism reached only to silence. Emma allowed he to talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped Emma up, without opening Emma lips. They arrived, the second carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with They instantly. Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness; Mr. Elton was so very cheerful in Mr. Elton civilities indeed, that Emma began to think Mr. Elton must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached Emma. Emma had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, "Much the same--not better." "_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard's," said Emma presently, "was not so pleasant as I had hoped--'Not better' was _my_ answer." Mr. Elton face lengthened immediately; and Mr. Elton voice was the voice of sentiment as Mr. Elton answered. "Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better, by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned-- I had flattered myself that concerned-- must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given concerned-- in the morning." Emma smiled and answered--"My visit was of use to the nervous part of Emma complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with Emma, as you probably heard." "Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--" "Mr. Perry has been used to Emma in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is impossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!" "Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment." This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things, and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment. "What an excellent device," said he, "the use of a sheepskin for carriages. How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel cold with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find not a breath of air way unpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very cold afternoon--but in a gentleman's carriage we know nothing of the matter.--Ha! snows a little I see." "Yes," said John Knightley, "and I think we shall have a good deal of it." "Christmas weather," observed Mr. Elton. "Quite seasonable; and extremely fortunate we may think we that it did not begin yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possibly have done, for Mr. Weston would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites their friends about their, and people think little of even the worst weather. I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week. Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away till that very day se'nnight." John Knightley looked as if John Knightley did not comprehend the pleasure, but said only, coolly, "I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls." At another time Emma might have been amused, but Emma was too much astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party. "We are sure of excellent fires," continued John Knightley, "and every thing in the greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--Mrs. Emma indeed is much beyond praise, and Emma is exactly what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;--it will be a small party, but where small parties are select, small parties are perhaps the most agreeable of any. Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with John Knightley, (turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings." "I know nothing of the large parties of LondonLondon, sir--I never dine with any body." "Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will be paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great enjoyment." "My first enjoyment," replied John Knightley, as they passed through the sweep-gate, "will be to find John Knightley safe at Hartfield again."
