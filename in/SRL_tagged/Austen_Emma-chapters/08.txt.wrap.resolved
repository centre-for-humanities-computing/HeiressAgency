Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past Harriet had been spending more than half Harriet time there, and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to Harriet; and Emma judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep Harriet with safest and kindest as much as possible just at present. Harriet was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that Harriet should return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days. While Harriet was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up Mr. Knightley mind to walk out, was persuaded by Mr. Knightley daughter not to defer it, and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of Mr. Knightley own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about Mr. Knightley, was offering by Mr. Knightley short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other. "Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley. We invalids think We are privileged people." "My dear sir, do not make a stranger of My dear sir." "I leave an excellent substitute in his daughter. Emma will be happy to entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns--my winter walk." "You cannot do better, My dear sir." "I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey." "Thank you, My dear sir, thank you; I am going this moment My dear sir; and I think the sooner _you_ go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for My dear sir." Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more chat. Mr. Woodhouse began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of Harriet with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before. "I cannot rate Harriet beauty as you do," said Mr. Woodhouse; "but Harriet is a pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of Harriet disposition. Harriet character depends upon those Harriet is with; but in good hands Harriet will turn out a valuable woman." "I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting." "Come," said Mr. Woodhouse, "you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you that you have improved Harriet. You have cured Harriet of Harriet school-girl's giggle; Harriet really does you credit." "Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may. _You_ do not often overpower me with it." "You are expecting Harriet again, you say, this morning?" "Almost every moment. Harriet has been gone longer already than Harriet intended." "Something has happened to delay Harriet; some visitors perhaps." "Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!" "Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would." Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said nothing. He presently added, with a smile, "I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to your little friend advantage." "Indeed! how so? of what sort?" "A very serious sort, I assure you;" still smiling. "Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love with Harriet? Who makes you their confidant?" Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint. Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and Mr. Knightley knew Mr. Elton looked up to Mr. Elton. "I have reason to think," Mr. Elton replied, "that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert Martin is the man. Mr. Knightley visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have done Mr. Elton business. Mr. Elton is desperately in love and means to marry Mr. Knightley." "Mr. Elton is very obliging," said Emma; "but is Mr. Elton sure that Harriet means to marry Mr. Elton?" "Well, well, means to make Mr. Knightley an offer then. Will that do? Mr. Elton came to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. Mr. Elton knows I have a thorough regard for Mr. Elton and all Mr. Elton family, and, I believe, considers me as one of Mr. Elton best friends. Mr. Elton came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in Mr. Elton to settle so early; whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved Mr. Elton choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered (especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society above Mr. Elton. I was very much pleased with all that Mr. Elton said. I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin. Mr. Elton always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. Mr. Elton told me every thing; Mr. Elton circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in the event of Mr. Elton marriage. Mr. Elton is an excellent young man, both as son and brother. I had no hesitation in advising Mr. Elton to marry. Mr. Elton proved to me that Mr. Elton could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced Mr. Elton could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent Mr. Elton away very happy. If Mr. Elton had never esteemed my opinion before, Mr. Elton would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, Mr. Elton would not allow much time to pass before Mr. Elton spoke to the fair lady, and as Mr. Elton does not appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that Mr. Elton should be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and Mrs. Goddard may be detained by a visitor, without thinking Mr. Elton at all a tiresome wretch." "Pray, Mr. Knightley," said Emma, who had been smiling to Mrs. Goddard through a great part of this speech, "how do you know that Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday?" "Certainly," replied Mr. Martin, surprized, "I do not absolutely know it; but it may be inferred. Was not Mrs. Goddard the whole day with you?" "Come," said Mrs. Goddard, "I will tell you something, in return for what you have told me. Mr. Martin did speak yesterday--that is, Mr. Martin wrote, and was refused." This was obliged to be repeated before This could be believed; and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as Mr. Knightley stood up, in tall indignation, and said, "Then Mrs. Goddard is a greater simpleton than I ever believed Mrs. Goddard. What is the foolish girl about?" "Oh! to be sure," cried Emma, "it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks a woman." "Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is so; but I hope you are mistaken." "I saw Mrs. Goddard answer!--nothing could be clearer." "You saw Mrs. Goddard answer!--you wrote Mrs. Goddard answer too. Emma, this is your doing. You persuaded Emma to refuse her answer!--you." "And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not feel that I had done wrong. Robert Martin is a very respectable young man, but I cannot admit Robert Martin to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprized indeed that Robert Martin should have ventured to address Harriet. By your account, Robert Martin does seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever got over." "Not Harriet's equal!" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, "No, Mr. Knightley is not Not Harriet equal indeed, for Mr. Knightley is as much Not Harriet superior in sense as in situation. Emma, your infatuation about Not Harriet blinds you. What are Harriet Smith claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion higher than Robert Martin? Not Harriet is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable relations. Not Harriet is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school. Not Harriet is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. Not Harriet has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing Not Harriet. At Not Harriet age Not Harriet can have no experience, and with Not Harriet little wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail Not Harriet. Not Harriet is pretty, and Not Harriet is good tempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on My only scruple in advising the match account, as being beneath My only scruple in advising the match deserts, and a bad connexion for My only scruple in advising the match. I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability My only scruple in advising the match might do much better; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, My only scruple in advising the match could not do worse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in Not Harriet, to Not Harriet having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like My only scruple in advising the match, might be easily led aright and turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on Not Harriet side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out upon Not Harriet extreme good luck. Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake of your friend being settled so well. I remember saying to myself, 'Even Emma, with all your friend partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.'" "I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all a farmer sense and all a farmer merit Robert Martin is nothing more,) a good match for the best friend! Not regret Emma leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you mine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair. You are not just to Harriet's claims. Harriet's claims would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself; Robert Martin may be the richest of the two, but Robert Martin is undoubtedly Harriet inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which Harriet moves is much above his.--It would be a degradation." "A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!" "As to the circumstances of Harriet birth, though in a legal sense Harriet may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. Harriet is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with whom Harriet is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that Harriet father is a gentleman--and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for Harriet improvement or comfort.--That Harriet is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to myself; that Harriet associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, will deny.--She is superior to Robert Martin." "Whoever might be Harriet parents," said Mr. Knightley, "whoever may have had the charge of Harriet, it does not appear to have been any part of her parents plan to introduce Harriet into what you would call good society. After receiving a very indifferent education Harriet is left in Mrs. Goddard's hands to shift as she can;--to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. Harriet friends evidently thought this good enough for Harriet; and this _was_ good enough. Harriet desired nothing better Harriet. Till you chose to turn Harriet into a friend, Harriet mind had no distaste for Harriet own set, nor any ambition beyond her own set. Harriet was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer. Harriet had no sense of superiority then. If Harriet has it now, you have given she has it now. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far, if Robert Martin had not felt persuaded of Harriet not being disinclined to Robert Martin. I know Robert Martin well. Robert Martin has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, Robert Martin is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it Robert Martin had encouragement." It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion; Emma chose rather to take up Emma own line of the subject again. "You are a very warm friend to Robert Martin; but, as I said before, are unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent Harriet's claims to marry well. Harriet is not a clever girl, but Harriet has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have Harriet understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, and supposing Harriet to be, as you describe Harriet, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree Harriet possesses them, them are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for Harriet is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject than men are generally supposed; till men do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be nice. Harriet good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of Harriet, and a great readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper, the highest claims a woman could possess." "Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply it as you do." "To be sure!" cried Emma playfully. "I know _that_ is the feeling of you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in--what at once bewitches every man senses and satisfies every man judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, you all, ever to marry, Harriet is the very woman for you all. And is Harriet, at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at because Harriet does not accept the first offer Harriet receives? No--pray let Harriet have time to look about Harriet." "I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy," said Mr. Knightley presently, "though I have kept my thoughts to Mr. Knightley; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff Harriet up with such ideas of Harriet own beauty, and of what Harriet has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within Harriet reach will be good enough for Harriet. Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise a young lady expectations too high. Harriet Smith Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though Harriet Smith is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond of connecting Men of family with a girl of such obscurity--and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace most prudent men might be involved in, when the mystery of Harriet Smith parentage came to be revealed. Let Harriet Smith marry Robert Martin, and Harriet Smith is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage Harriet Smith to expect to marry greatly, and teach Harriet Smith to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune, Harriet Smith may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest of Harriet Smith life--or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,) till Harriet Smith grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writing-master's son." "We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there can be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more angry. But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible; Harriet Smith has refused Robert Martin, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any second application. Harriet Smith must abide by the evil of having refused Robert Martin, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I might not influence Harriet Smith a little; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. Robert Martin appearance is so much against Robert Martin, and Robert Martin manner so bad, that if Harriet Smith ever were disposed to favour Robert Martin, Harriet Smith is not now. I can imagine, that before Harriet Smith had seen any body superior, Harriet Smith might tolerate Robert Martin. Robert Martin was the brother of Harriet Smith friends, and Robert Martin took pains to please Harriet Smith; and altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been Robert Martin great assistant) Harriet Smith might not, while Harriet Smith was at Abbey-Mill, find she was at Abbey-Mill disagreeable. But the case is altered now. Harriet Smith knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet." "Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!" cried Mr. Knightley.--"Robert Robert Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend Martin's manners; and Martin's manners mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand." Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting Martin's manners very much to be gone. Emma did not repent what Emma had done; Emma still thought Emma a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than Martin's manners could be; but yet Emma had a sort of habitual respect for Martin's manners judgment in general, which made Emma dislike having it so loudly against Emma; and to have Martin's manners sitting just opposite to Emma in angry state, was very disagreeable. Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather, but Martin's manners made no answer. Martin's manners was thinking. The result of Martin's manners thoughts appeared at last in these words. "Robert Martin has no great loss--if Robert Martin can but think so; and I hope he can will not be long before Robert Martin does. Your views for Harriet are best known to Harriet; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to Harriet that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain." Emma laughed and disclaimed. Robert Martin continued, "Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man, and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make an imprudent match. Elton knows the value of a good income as well as any body. Elton may talk sentimentally, but Elton will act rationally. Elton is as well acquainted with Elton own claims, as you can be with Harriet's. Elton knows that Elton is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite wherever Elton goes; and from Elton general way of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that Elton does not mean to throw Elton away. I have heard Elton speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that Elton sisters are intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece." "I am very much obliged to you," said Emma, laughing again. "If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well." "Good morning to you,"--said he, rising and walking off abruptly. he was very much vexed. he felt the disappointment of the young man, and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair, was provoking he exceedingly. Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of Emma, than in he. Emma did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with Emma, so entirely convinced that Emma opinions were right and Emma adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley. he walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for Emma. Emma was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make Emma uneasy. The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading Harriet own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such reason to give for Harriet long absence, Harriet felt a satisfaction which settled Harriet with Harriet own mind, and convinced Harriet, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what Mr. Knightley would, Harriet had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify. Mr. Knightley had frightened Harriet a little about Elton; but when Harriet considered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed Mr. Knightley as Harriet had done, neither with the interest, nor (Harriet must be allowed to tell Harriet, in spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as Harriet, that Mr. Knightley had spoken it hastily and in anger, Harriet was able to believe, that Mr. Knightley had rather said what Mr. Knightley wished resentfully to be true, than what Mr. Knightley knew any thing about. Mr. Knightley certainly might have heard Elton speak with more unreserve than Harriet had ever done, and Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters; Elton might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to otherwise; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of course effects; but Mr. Knightley saw too much of course to feel a doubt of course overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, Mr. Knightley was very sure did not belong to Elton. Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: Mr. Knightley came back, not to think of Robert Martin, but to talk of Elton. Harriet Smith had been telling Mr. Knightley something, which Mr. Knightley repeated immediately with great delight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child, and Harriet Smith had seen Mr. Perry, and Mr. Perry had told Harriet Smith, that as Mr. Perry was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, Mr. Perry had met Elton, and found to Mr. Perry great surprize, that Elton was actually on Mr. Perry road to London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which Mr. Perry had been never known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with Mr. Perry about it, and told Mr. Perry how shabby it was in Mr. Perry, Mr. Elton was actually on his road to London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before best player, to absent Mr. Perry, and tried very much to persuade Mr. Perry to put off Mr. Perry journey only one day; but it would not do; Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed, that Mr. Perry was going on business which Mr. Perry would not put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand Mr. Perry, but Mr. Perry was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case, and Mr. Perry told Mr. Perry so; and Elton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits. Harriet Smith had told Harriet Smith all this, and had talked a great deal more about Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at Harriet Smith, "that Harriet Smith did not pretend to understand what Mr. Perry business might be, but Harriet Smith only knew that any woman whom Elton could prefer, Harriet Smith should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Elton had not Elton equal for beauty or agreeableness."
