Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For the present, Mr. Frank Churchill could not be spared, to Mr. Frank Churchill "very great mortification and regret; but still Mr. Frank Churchill looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period." Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed, in fact, than Mrs. Weston husband, though Mrs. Weston dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever expecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression. its soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again. For half an hour Mrs. Weston was surprized and sorry; but then Mrs. Weston began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three months later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather; and that Mrs. Weston would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably longer with them than if Mrs. Weston had come sooner. These feelings rapidly restored Mrs. Weston comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her was to suffer, suffered a great deal more her. her was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr. Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. her wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that her should appear, in general, like her usual self, her took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturally belong to their friendship. her was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping Mr. Frank Churchill away. her then proceeded to say a good deal more than her felt, of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the sight of Mr. Frank Churchill would have made; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again, found her directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that her was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against her. "the Churchills are very likely in fault," said Mr. Knightley, coolly; "but I dare say Mr. Frank Churchill might come if Mr. Frank Churchill would." "I do not know why you should say so. Mr. Frank Churchill wishes exceedingly to come; but Mr. Frank Churchill uncle and aunt will not spare Mr. Frank Churchill." "I cannot believe that Mr. Frank Churchill has not the power of coming, if Mr. Frank Churchill made a point of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof." "How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose Mr. Frank Churchill such an unnatural creature?" "I am not supposing Mr. Frank Churchill at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that Mr. Frank Churchill may have learnt to be above Mr. Frank Churchill connexions, and to care very little for any thing but Mr. Frank Churchill own pleasure, from living with those who have always set Mr. Frank Churchill the example of it. It is a great deal more natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too. If Mr. Frank Churchill had wanted to see Mr. Frank Churchill father, Mr. Frank Churchill would have contrived it between September and January. A man at Mr. Frank Churchill age--what is he?--three or four-and-twenty--cannot be without the means of doing as much as that. It is impossible." "That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage." "It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. a man of three or four-and-twenty cannot want money--a man of three or four-and-twenty cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that a man of three or four-and-twenty has so much of both, that a man of three or four-and-twenty is glad to get rid of both at the idlest haunts in the kingdom. We hear of a man of three or four-and-twenty for ever at some watering-place or other. A little while ago, a man of three or four-and-twenty was at Weymouth. This proves that a man of three or four-and-twenty can leave the Churchills." "Yes, sometimes a man of three or four-and-twenty can." "And those times are whenever a man of three or four-and-twenty thinks it worth a man of three or four-and-twenty while; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure." "It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate knowledge of any body's conduct situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of a family may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill's temper, before We pretend to decide upon what Mrs. Churchill nephew can do. her nephew may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than her nephew can at others." "There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if a man chuses, and that is, a man duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and resolution. It is Mr. Frank Churchill. Mrs. Churchill knows it to be so, by Mrs. Churchill promises and messages; but if Mrs. Churchill wished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill-- 'Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but I must go and see his father immediately. I know his father would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to his father on the present occasion. I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'-- If his father would say so to Mrs. Churchill-- ' at once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no opposition made to his father going." "No," said Emma, laughing; "but perhaps there might be some made to his father coming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to use!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought Mr. Frank Churchill up, and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as loud as Mr. Frank Churchill could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable?" "Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it. Mr. Frank Churchill would feel Mr. Frank Churchill in the right; and the declaration--made, of course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner--would do Mr. Frank Churchill more good, raise Mr. Frank Churchill higher, fix Mr. Frank Churchill interest stronger with the people Mr. Frank Churchill depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do. Respect would be added to affection. Respect would feel that Respect could trust Mr. Frank Churchill; that the nephew who had done rightly by Mr. Frank Churchill father, would do rightly by Respect; for Respect know, as well as Mr. Frank Churchill does, as well as all the world must know, that Mr. Frank Churchill ought to pay this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting Respect power to delay it, are in Respect hearts not thinking the better of Mr. Frank Churchill for submitting to Respect whims. Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If Mr. Frank Churchill would act in this sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, he would act in this sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly little minds would bend to Mr. Frank Churchill." "I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think rich people have a knack of swelling out, till rich people are quite as unmanageable as great ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's situation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for Mr. Frank Churchill; and it might have a very good effect. The Churchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through. To Mr. Frank Churchill who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set all their claims on Mr. Frank Churchill gratitude and regard at nought. Mr. Frank Churchill may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it." "Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction." "Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those, whom as child and boy an amiable young man has been looking up to all an amiable young man life." "an amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first occasion of an amiable young man carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others. It ought to have been a habit with an amiable young man by this time, of following an amiable young man duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man. As the man became rational, the man ought to have roused the man and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority. the man ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make the man slight the man . Had the man begun as the man ought, there would have been no difficulty now." "We shall never agree about the man," cried her; "but that is nothing extraordinary. I have not the least idea of the man being a weak young man: I feel sure that the man is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly, though in Mr. Weston own son; but Mr. Weston is very likely to have a more yielding, complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's perfection. I dare say Mr. Weston has; and though it may cut Mr. Weston off from some advantages, it will secure Mr. Weston many others." "Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when Mr. Weston ought to move, and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying Mr. Weston extremely expert in finding excuses for it. Mr. Weston can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade Mr. Weston that Mr. Weston has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing Mr. Weston 's having any right to complain. Mr. Weston letters disgust me." "Your feelings are singular. Your feelings seem to satisfy every body else." "I suspect Your feelings do not satisfy Mr. Weston. Your feelings hardly can satisfy a woman of Mr. Weston good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother's place, but without a mother's affection to blind a mother. It is on a mother account that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and a mother must doubly feel the omission. Had a mother been a person of consequence a mother, a person of consequence would have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether a person of consequence did or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations? Do you suppose a mother does not often say all this to a mother? No, her, your amiable young man can be amiable only in French, not in English. your amiable young man may be very 'aimable,' have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but your amiable young man can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about your amiable young man." "You seem determined to think ill of your amiable young man." "Me!--not at all," replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; "I do not want to think ill of your amiable young man. I should be as ready to acknowledge your amiable young man merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely personal; that your amiable young man is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth, plausible manners." "Well, if your amiable young man have nothing else to recommend your amiable young man, your amiable young man will be a treasure at Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and agreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ your amiable young man coming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--one object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak of nobody else." "You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find Mr. Frank Churchill conversable, I shall be glad of Mr. Frank Churchill acquaintance; but if Mr. Frank Churchill is only a chattering coxcomb, Mr. Frank Churchill will not occupy much of my time or thoughts." "My idea of Mr. Frank Churchill is, that Mr. Frank Churchill can adapt Mr. Frank Churchill conversation to the taste of every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable. To you, Mr. Frank Churchill will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that general information on all subjects which will enable Mr. Frank Churchill to follow the lead, or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each; that is My idea of him." "And mine," said Mr. Knightley warmly, "is, that if Mr. Knightley turn out any thing like it, Mr. Knightley will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What! at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company--the great man--the practised politician, who is to read every body's character, and make every body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to be dispensing his flatteries around, that his may make all appear like fools compared with his! her, your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point." "I will say no more about his," cried her, "you turn every thing to evil. We are both prejudiced; her against, I for his; and We have no chance of agreeing till his is really here." "Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced." "But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour." "his is a person I never think of from one month's end to another," said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made her immediately talk of something else, though her could not comprehend why his should be angry. To take a dislike to a young man, only because his appeared to be of a different disposition from his, was unworthy the real liberality of mind which her was always used to acknowledge in his; for with all the high opinion of his, which her had often laid to his charge, her had never before for a moment supposed it could make his unjust to the merit of another.
