Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known how much of she happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley, first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so, and feeling it she due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had been.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no female connexions of been.--Long own, there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far been.--Long loved and esteemed Isabella. she had she been first with been.--Long for many years past. she had not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse, slighting been.--Long advice, or even wilfully opposing been.--Long, insensible of half been.--Long merits, and quarrelling with been.--Long because been.--Long would not acknowledge she false and insolent estimate of she own--but still, from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, been.--Long had loved she, and watched over she from a girl, with an endeavour to improve she, and an anxiety for she doing right, which no other creature had at all shared. In spite of all she faults, she knew she was dear to been.--Long; might she not say, very dear?-- When the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here, presented the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here, she could not presume to indulge the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here. Harriet Smith might think she not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley. _She_ could not. she could not flatter she with any idea of blindness in been.--Long attachment to _her_. she had received a very recent proof of _her_. impartiality.-- How shocked had been.--Long been by she behaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had been.--Long expressed been.--Long to she on the subject!--Not too strongly for the offence--but far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.-- she had no hope, nothing to deserve the name of hope, that been.--Long could have that sort of affection for she which was now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at times much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived she, and be overrating been.--Long regard for _her_.--Wish it she must, for been.--Long sake--be the consequence nothing to she, but been.--Long remaining single all been.--Long life.

It would be incompatible with what she owed to she father, and with what she felt for her father. Nothing should separate she from her father. she would not marry, even if she were asked by the same Mr. Knightley. It must be she ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- here.-- was expected back every day. The power of observation would be soon given--frightfully soon The power of observation appeared when she thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- The power of observation would do neither of them good, The power of observation would do the subject no good, to be talking of The power of observation farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet's confidence. To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to Harriet, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that Harriet would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be Harriet conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of others--Harriet objected only to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and approved, and was grateful. This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed they, sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Mr. WestonMr. Churchillher daughter-in-law . Mr. Weston had accompanied Mr. Weston to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through Mr. Weston share of this essential attention most handsomely; but Mr. Weston having then induced Miss Fairfax to join Mr. Weston in an airing, was now returned with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded. A little curiosity Emma had; and Emma made the most of it while Emma friend related. Mr. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation Mr. Weston; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known; as, considering every thing, Mr. Weston thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:--but Mr. Weston had thought differently; Mr. Churchill was extremely anxious to shew Mr. Churchill approbation to Miss Fairfax and Mr. Weston family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for "such things," Mr. Churchill observed, "always got about." Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short--and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. the lady had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn how deeply the lady was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt satisfaction of the lady, and the rapturous delight of the lady daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly respectable in They happiness, so disinterested in every sensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of They, that every kindly feeling was at work for They. Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mr. Weston to invite Mr. Weston to an airing; Mr. Weston had drawn back and declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of They drive, Mr. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of Mr. Weston embarrassment, as to bring Mr. Weston to converse on the important subject. Apologies for Mr. Weston seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude Mr. Weston was always feeling towards Mr. Weston and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by, these effusions had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement. Mr. Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to Mr. Weston companion, pent up within Mr. Weston own mind as every thing had so long been, and was very much pleased with all that Mr. Weston had said on the subject. "On the misery of what Mr. Weston had suffered, during the concealment of so many months," continued Mr. Weston, "Mr. Weston was energetic. This was one of Mr. Weston expressions. 'I will not say, that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart." "Poor girl!" said Emma. "Emma thinks Emma wrong, then, for having consented to a private engagement?" "Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame Emma more than Emma is disposed to blame Emma. 'The consequence,' said Emma, 'has been a state of perpetual suffering to Emma; and so it ought. But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. Pain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me ought not to be.' 'Do not imagine, madam,' she continued, 'that I was taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.'" "Poor girl!" said Emma again. "Emma loves Colonel Campbell then excessively, I suppose. It must have been from attachment only, that Emma could be led to form the engagement. Emma affection must have overpowered Emma judgment." "Yes, I have no doubt of Emma being extremely attached to him." "I am afraid," returned Emma, sighing, "that I must often have contributed to make Emma unhappy." "On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But Emma probably had something of that in Emma thoughts, when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One natural consequence of the evil Emma had involved Emma in," Emma said, "was that of making Emma _unreasonable_. The consciousness of having done amiss, had exposed Emma to a thousand inquietudes, and made Emma captious and irritable to a degree that must have been--that had been--hard for he to bear. 'I did not make the allowances,' said Emma, 'which I ought to have done, for he temper and spirits--he delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.' Emma then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you had shewn Emma during Emma illness; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity, to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every wish and every endeavour to do Emma good. Emma was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from Emma." "If I did not know Emma to be happy now," said Emma, seriously, "which, in spite of every little drawback from Emma scrupulous conscience, Emma must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh! Mr. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well (checking Emma, and trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars. these interesting particulars shew Emma to the greatest advantage. I am sure Emma is very good--I hope Emma will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune should be on the fortune side, for I think the merit will be all on hers." Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mr. Weston. Mr. Weston thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, Mr. Weston loved Frank very much, and Mr. Weston defence was, therefore, earnest. Mr. Weston talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--but Mr. Weston had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; Mr. Weston forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mr. Weston ended with, "We have not yet had the letter We are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come," Mr. Weston was obliged to pause before Mr. Weston answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before Mr. Weston could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for. "Are you well, EmmaEmma?" was Mr. Weston's parting question. "Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter we are so anxious as soon as possible." Mr. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection, by increasing Emma esteem and compassion, and Emma sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. Emma bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with Emma, and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause. Had Emma followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way Emma due; had Emma tried to know Emma better; had Emma done Emma part towards intimacy; had Emma endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; Emma must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on Emma now.--Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as an associate for Emma, to be received with gratitude; and the other--what was she?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends; that Emma had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matter--which was most probable--still, in knowing Emma as Emma ought, and as Emma might, Emma must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which Emma had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured Emma, but had so unpardonably imparted; an idea which Emma greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by the levity or carelessness of Mr. Churchill. Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former, since Emma coming to Highbury, Emma was persuaded that Emma must Emma have been the worst. Emma must have been a perpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without Emma having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more. The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield. The weather added what The weather could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in, and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights the longer visible. The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and Mr. Woodhouse could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on Mr. Woodhouse daughter's side, and by exertions which had never cost his daughter half so much before. It reminded his daughter of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mr. Weston's wedding-day; but his daughter had walked in then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over. The picture which his daughter had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted no friends, no pleasures had been lost.--But his daughter present forebodings his daughter feared would experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before his daughter now, was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled-- that might not be even partially brightened. If all took place that might take place among the circle of his daughter friends, Hartfield must be comparatively deserted; and his daughter left to cheer his daughter father with the spirits only of ruined happiness. The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than The child to be born at Randalls; and Mr. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it. They should lose The child to be born at Randalls; and, probably, in great measure, The child to be born at Randalls husband also.--Frank Mr. Churchill would return among They no more; and Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to Highbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe. All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within They reach? his daughter to be no longer coming there for his daughter evening comfort!-- No longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change his daughter own home for their's!--How was it to be endured? And if his daughter were to be lost to them for Harriet's sake; if his daughter were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society all that his daughter wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom his daughter looked for all the best blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from Harriet mind, that the reflection had been all Harriet own work? When it came to such a pitch as this, Harriet was not able to refrain from a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of Harriet own better conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of Harriet life to the past, it would yet find Harriet more rational, more acquainted with Harriet, and leave Harriet less to regret when it were gone.
