A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in Emma hand, and after sitting down and hesitating, thus began: "Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I should like to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then, you know, it will be over." Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged Emma to speak. There was a seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared Harriet, quite as much as Harriet words, for something more than ordinary. "It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish," Emma continued, "to have no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and I dare say you understand me." "Yes," said Emma, "I hope I do." "How I could so long a time be fancying myself! . . ." cried Harriet, warmly. "It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet him or not--except that of the two I had rather not see him--and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him--but I do not envy him wife in the least; I neither admire his wife nor envy his wife, as I have done: his wife is very charming, I dare say, and all that, but I think his wife very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall never forget his wife look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, I wish his wife no evil.--No, let no evil.--No be ever so happy together, it will not give me another moment's pang: and to convince you that I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I ought to have destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept-- I know that very well (blushing as kept-- spoke).--However, now I will destroy it all--and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you may see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?" said kept--, with a conscious look. "Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?" "No--I cannot call them gifts; but them are things that I have valued very much." kept-- held this parcel towards kept--, and Emma read the words _Most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top. kept-- curiosity was greatly excited. Harriet unfolded this parcel, and Harriet looked on with impatience. Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but, excepting the softest cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister. "Now," said Harriet, "you _must_ recollect." "No, indeed I do not." "Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came-- I think the very evening.--Do not you remember the very evening.--Do cutting the very evening.--Do finger with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?-- But, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply the very evening.--Do; and so I took mine out and cut the very evening.--Do a piece; but a piece was a great deal too large, and the very evening.--Do cut a piece smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before the very evening.--Do gave a piece back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it--so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then as a great treat." "Harriet!" cried Emma, putting Emma hand before Emma face, and jumping up, "you make me more ashamed of me than I can bear. Remember it? me, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this relic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting his finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none about me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--go on--what else?" "And had you really some at hand me? I am sure I never suspected it, you did it so naturally." "And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!" said Emma, recovering from Emma state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement. And secretly Emma added to Emma, "Lord bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I never was equal to this." "Here," resumed Harriet, turning to Emma box again, "here is something still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister never did." Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of an old pencil,--the part without any lead. "This was really his," said Harriet.--"Do not you remember one morning?--no, I dare say you do not. But one morning--I forget exactly the day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_ _evening_, his wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; a memorandum was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling Mr. Knightley something about brewing spruce-beer, and Mr. Knightley wanted to put a memorandum down; but when Mr. Knightley took out Mr. Knightley pencil, there was so little lead that Mr. Knightley soon cut it all away, and it would not do, so you lent Mr. Knightley another, and this was left upon the table as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on my eye; and, as soon as I dared, caught my eye up, and never parted with my eye again from that moment." "I do remember my eye," cried Emma; "I perfectly remember it.-- Talking about spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Mr. Knightley and I both saying Knightley and I both liked my eye, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like my eye too. I perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was not Mr. Knightley? I have an idea Mr. Knightley was standing just here." "Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.--It is very odd, but I cannot recollect.--Mr. Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I am now."-- "Well, go on." "Oh! that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see me do the fire." "My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things?" "Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn these things. it was very wrong of I, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with these things." "But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be useful." "I shall be happier to burn the court-plaister," replied Harriet. "the court-plaister has a disagreeable look to I. I must get rid of every thing.-- There the court-plaister goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton." "And when," thought Emma, "will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?" Emma had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though Emma had _told_ no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight after the alarm, the gipsy, though she had _told_ no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight after the alarm came to a sufficient explanation, and quite undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the information Emma received more valuable. Emma merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, "Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so"--and thought no more of it, till after a minute's silence Emma heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, "I shall never marry." Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied, "Never marry!--This is a new resolution." "It is one that I shall never change, however." After another short hesitation, "I hope It does not proceed from--I hope It is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?" "Mr. Elton indeed!" cried Harriet indignantly.--"Oh! Emma Emma could just catch the words, "so superior to Mr. Elton!" Emma then took a longer time for consideration. Should Emma proceed no farther?--should Emma let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?-- Perhaps Harriet might think Emma cold or angry if Emma did; or perhaps if Emma were totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking Emma to hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, Emma was perfectly resolved.-- Emma believed it would be wiser for Emma to say and know at once, all that Emma meant to say and know. Plain dealing was always best. Emma had previously determined how far Emma would proceed, on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the judicious law of Emma own brain laid down with speed.-- Emma was decided, and thus spoke-- "Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?" "Oh! Emma, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose-- Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance--and to think of him infinite superiority to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so proper, in me especially." "I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart." "Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!-- The very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--when I saw he coming--he noble look--and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In one moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!" "It is very natural. It is natural, and It is honourable.-- Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.-- But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise. I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage for its being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be wisest in Harriet to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not let you can carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Be observant of his. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I give you this caution now, because I shall never speak to Harriet again on the subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I know nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. our were very wrong before; our will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have been matches of greater disparity. But take care of Harriet. I would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value." Harriet kissed Harriet hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for Emma friend. Its tendency would be to raise and refine Emma mind--and Its tendency must be saving Emma from the danger of degradation.
