This letter must make This letter way to Emma's feelings. Emma was obliged, in spite of Emma previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as Emma came to Emma own name, it was irresistible; every line relating to Emma was interesting, and almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain the subject, by the natural return of Emma former regard for the writer, and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for Emma at that moment. Emma never stopt till Emma had gone through the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than Emma had supposed--and he had suffered, and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and Miss Fairfax was so happy Miss Fairfax, that there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, Miss Fairfax must have shaken hands with he as heartily as ever. Miss Fairfax thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again, Miss Fairfax desired Mr. Knightley to read it. Miss Fairfax was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so much to blame in Mr. Knightley conduct. "I shall be very glad to look it over," said Mr. Knightley; "but it seems long. I will take it home with me at night." But that would not do. Mrs. Weston was to call in the evening, and Mrs. Weston must return it by Mrs. Weston. "I would rather be talking to you," Mrs. Weston replied; "but as it seems a matter of justice, it shall be done." Mrs. Weston began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, "Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to Mrs. Weston mother-in-law a few months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference." Mrs. Weston proceeded a little farther, reading to Mrs. Weston; and then, with a smile, observed, "Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is Mrs. Weston way. One man's style must not be the rule of another's. We will not be severe." "It will be natural for me," Mrs. Weston added shortly afterwards, "to speak my opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you. It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it--" "Not at all. I should wish it." Mr. Knightley returned to Mr. Knightley reading with greater alacrity. "Mr. Knightley trifles here," said Mr. Knightley, "as to the temptation. Mr. Knightley knows Mr. Knightley is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to have formed the engagement.--'His father's disposition:'--he is unjust, however, to the engagement.--'His father. Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a blessing on all Mr. Knightley upright and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before Mr. Weston endeavoured to gain it.--Very true; Mr. Weston did not come till Miss Fairfax was here." "And I have not forgotten," said Emma, "how sure you were that Mr. Weston might have come sooner if Mr. Weston would. You pass he might have come sooner if he would over very handsomely--but you were perfectly right." "I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think-- had _you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted Mr. Weston." When Mr. Weston came to Miss Woodhouse, Mr. Weston was obliged to read the whole of it aloud--all that related to Miss Woodhouse, with a smile; a look; a shake of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as the subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady reflection, thus-- "Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous game. Too much indebted to the event for Mr. Weston acquittal.-- No judge of Mr. Weston own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by No judge of his own manners by you.--Always own wishes, and regardless of little besides No judge of his own manners by you.--Always own convenience.-- Fancying you to have fathomed No judge of his own manners by you.--Always secret. Natural enough!--his own mind full of intrigue, that Natural enough!--his should suspect Natural enough!--his in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert the understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?" My Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account, which My Emma could not give any sincere explanation of. "You had better go on," said My Emma. He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, "the pianoforte! Ah! That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure. A boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot comprehend a man's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which a man knows a woman would rather dispense with; and a man did know that a woman would have prevented the instrument's coming if a woman could." After this, a man made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill's confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing. "I perfectly agree with you, sir,"--was then his remark. "You did behave very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line." And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and Frank Churchill persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right, Frank Churchill made a fuller pause to say, "This is very bad.--He had induced Jane Fairfax's to place Jane Fairfax's, for Frank Churchill sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been Frank Churchill first object to prevent Jane Fairfax's from suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than Frank Churchill could. Frank Churchill should have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were all reasonable. We must look to hers one fault, and remember that hers had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that hers should have been in such a state of punishment." Emma knew that Frank Churchill was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew uncomfortable. Emma own behaviour had been so very improper! Emma was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of Frank Churchill next look. It was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at Emma, instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain--no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist. "There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the Eltons," was his next observation.--"His feelings are natural.-- What! actually resolve to break with his entirely!--She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each--entirely!--She dissolved it.--What a view this gives of entirely!--She sense of entirely!--She behaviour!--Well, entirely!--She must be a most extraordinary--" "Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much entirely!--She suffers." "I hope entirely!--She does," replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter. "'Smallridge!'--What does this mean? What is all this?" "entirely!--She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children--a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?" "Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even of Mrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter the man writes!" "I wish you would read What a letter with a kinder spirit towards the man." "Well, there _is_ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding here.--He ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of here.--He being fond of here.--He. 'Dearer, much dearer than ever.' I hope here.--He may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker, with here.--He thousands and tens of thousands.--'Happier than I deserve.' Come, here.--He knows here.--He there. 'Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?-- And a fine ending--and there is the letter. The child of good fortune! That was your name for The child of good fortune, was it?" "You do not appear so well satisfied with The child of good fortune as I am; but still you must, at least I hope you must, think the better of The child of good fortune for the letter. I hope the letter does The child of good fortune some service with you." "Yes, certainly the letter does. The child of good fortune has had great faults, faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of The child of good fortune opinion in thinking The child of good fortune likely to be happier than The child of good fortune deserves: but still as The child of good fortune is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with Miss Fairfax, I am very ready to believe The child of good fortune character will improve, and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me talk to you of something else. I have another person's interest at present so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill. Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on one subject." one subject followed; one subject was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman Mr. Knightley was in love with, how to be able to ask the woman he was in love to marry Mr. Knightley, without attacking the happiness of the woman he was in love . Emma's answer was ready at the first word. "While Emma lived, any change of condition must be impossible for Emma. Emma could never quit the engagement.--'His father." Part only of this answer, however, was admitted. The impossibility of Emma quitting Emma , Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as Mr. Knightley; but the inadmissibility of any other change, Mr. Knightley could not agree to. Mr. Knightley had been thinking it over most deeply, most intently; Mr. Knightley had at first hoped to induce Miss Woodhouse to remove with Miss Woodhouse to Donwell; Mr. Knightley had wanted to believe it feasible, but Mr. Knightley knowledge of Miss Woodhouse would not suffer Mr. Knightley to deceive Mr. Knightley long; and now Mr. Knightley confessed Mr. Knightley persuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of Miss Woodhouse 's comfort, perhaps even of Mr. Knightley life, which must not be hazarded. Miss Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No, Miss Woodhouse felt that it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, Miss Woodhouse trusted Miss Woodhouse dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable; it was, that Miss Woodhouse should be received at Hartfield; that so long as Emma 's happiness in other words Miss Woodhouse life--required Hartfield to continue Emma home, it should be Miss Woodhouse likewise. Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had Emma own passing thoughts. Like Miss Woodhouse, Emma had tried the scheme and rejected the scheme; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to Emma. Emma was sensible of all the affection it evinced. Emma felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that in living constantly with Emma , and in no house of he own, there would be much, very much, to be borne with. Emma promised to think of it, and advised he to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection could alter he wishes or he opinion on one subject. he had given it, he could assure Emma, very long and calm consideration; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have he thoughts to he. "Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for," cried Emma. "I am sure William Larkins will not like it. You must get William Larkins consent before you ask mine." mine promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme. It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in which mine was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never struck with any sense of injury to mine nephew Henry, whose rights as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think mine must of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet mine only gave mine a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time mine had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt. This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield--the more mine contemplated it, the more pleasing it became. his evils seemed to lessen, mine own advantages to increase, her own advantages mutual good to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for mine in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!-- Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy! mine would have been too happy but for HarrietHarriet; but every blessing of mine own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of mine friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family party which Emma was securing for Emma, Harriet Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a distance from. Harriet would be a loser in every way. Emma could not deplore Emma future absence as any deduction from Emma own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing the poor girl herself in such a state of unmerited punishment. In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is, supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr. Knightley would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--not like Mrs. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped than now; and every body really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that Harriet could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year.
