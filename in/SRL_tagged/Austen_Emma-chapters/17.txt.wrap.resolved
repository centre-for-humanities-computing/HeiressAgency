Mr. Woodhouse were not detained long at Hartfield. The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr. Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade Mr. Woodhouse daughter to stay behind with all his daughter children, was obliged to see the whole party set off, and return to Mr. Woodhouse lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella;--which poor Isabella, passing his daughter life with those his daughter doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently busy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness. The evening of the very day on which those she doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently busy went brought a note from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with Mr. Elton's best compliments, "that Mr. Elton was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in Mr. Elton way to Bath; where, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends, Mr. Elton had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted the impossibility Mr. Elton was under, from various circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities Mr. Elton should ever retain a grateful sense--and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be happy to attend to those she doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently busy." Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton's absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired. Emma admired Mr. Elton for contriving it, though not able to give Mr. Elton much credit for the manner in which it was announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to Emma father, from which Emma was so pointedly excluded. Emma had not even a share in Mr. Elton opening compliments.--Her name was not mentioned;--and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in Mr. Elton graceful acknowledgments, as Emma thought, at first, could not escape Emma father's suspicion. It did, however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey, and father fears that Elton might never get safely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in Elton language. It was a very useful note, for It supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of them lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse talked over Mr. Woodhouse alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade spirits away with all Emma usual promptitude. Emma now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. Emma had reason to believe Emma nearly recovered from Emma cold, and it was desirable that Emma should have as much time as possible for getting the better of Emma other complaint before the gentleman's return. Emma went to Mrs. Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one the necessary penance of communication was.-- Emma had to destroy all the hopes which Emma had been so industriously feeding--to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred--and acknowledge Emma grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all Emma ideas on one subject, all Emma observations, all Emma convictions, all Emma prophecies for the last six weeks. The confession completely renewed Emma first shame--and the sight of Harriet's tears made Harriet think that Harriet should never be in charity with Harriet again. Harriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody--and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of Harriet, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to Harriet friend. Harriet was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost; and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on Harriet's side, not Harriet own. Harriet did not consider Harriet as having any thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.-- Harriet never could have deserved him--and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible. Miss Woodhouse fell abundantly--but Miss Woodhouse grief was so truly artless, that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Harriet's eyes--and Miss Woodhouse listened to Miss Woodhouse and tried to console Miss Woodhouse with all Miss Woodhouse heart and understanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two--and that to resemble Miss Woodhouse would be more for Miss Woodhouse own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do. It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and ignorant; but Miss Woodhouse left Miss Woodhouse with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of Miss Woodhouse life. Miss Woodhouse second duty now, inferior only to Miss Woodhouse father's claims, was to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove Miss Woodhouse own affection in some better method than by match-making. Miss Woodhouse got Miss Woodhouse to Hartfield, and shewed Miss Woodhouse the most unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and amuse Miss Woodhouse, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton from Miss Woodhouse thoughts. Time, Miss Woodhouse knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and Miss Woodhouse could suppose Miss Woodhouse but an indifferent judge of such matters in general, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular; but it seemed to Miss Woodhouse reasonable that at Harriet's age, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance, without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing sentiments. Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did, in truth, prove Miss Woodhouse more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it appeared to Miss Woodhouse so natural, so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_, that Miss Woodhouse could not comprehend it continuing very long in equal force. If Mr. Elton, on Mr. Elton return, made Mr. Elton own indifference as evident and indubitable as Miss Woodhouse could not doubt Mr. Elton would anxiously do, Miss Woodhouse could not imagine Harriet's persisting to place Miss Woodhouse happiness in the sight or the recollection of Mr. Elton. Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for each, for all three. Not one of Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do had the power of removal, or of effecting any material change of society. Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do must encounter each other, and make the best of it. Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of Harriet companions at Mrs. Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that Harriet could have any chance of hearing Mr. Elton spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till Emma saw Emma in the way of cure, there could be no true peace for Emma.
