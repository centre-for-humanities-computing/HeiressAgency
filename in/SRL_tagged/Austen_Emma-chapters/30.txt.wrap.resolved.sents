One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston's confidence, Emma could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow the Churchills nephew to remain a day beyond their nephew fortnight.
But this was not judged feasible.
The preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days their must be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty--at the risk--in Emma opinion, the great risk, of her opinion being all in vain.
Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word.
Enscombe wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed.
All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of Emma ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's provoking indifference about it.
Either because he did not dance he, or because the plan had been formed without he being consulted, he seemed resolved that it should not interest he, determined against it exciting any present curiosity, or affording he any future amusement.
To Emma voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply, than, "Very well.
If the Westons think the Westons worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say against the Westons, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.-- Oh!
yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins's week's account; much rather, I confess.-- Pleasure in seeing dancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it-- I do not know who does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward.
Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different."
Emma Emma felt was aimed at Emma; and Emma made Emma quite angry.
Emma was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent, or so indignant; he was not guided by _Jane Fairfax_ feelings in reprobating the ball, for _Emma_ enjoyed the thought of she_ to an extraordinary degree.
she_ made Emma animated--open hearted--Emma voluntarily said;-- "Oh!
Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.
What a disappointment it would be!
I do look forward to it, I own, with _very_ great pleasure."
It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of William Larkins.
No!--she was more and more convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise.
There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side--but no love.
Alas!
there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley.
Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of every thing.
A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge Mr. Churchill nephew's instant return.
Mr. Churchill was unwell--far too unwell to do without Mr. Churchill; Mr. Churchill had been in a very suffering state (so said Mr. Churchill husband) when writing to his nephew two days before, though from Mr. Churchill usual unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of Mr. Churchill, Mr. Churchill had not mentioned it; but now Mr. Churchill was too ill to trifle, and must entreat Mr. Churchill to set off for Enscombe without delay.
The substance of A letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs. Weston, instantly.
As to Mr. Churchill going, it was inevitable.
Mr. Churchill must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for Mr. Churchill aunt, to lessen Mr. Churchill repugnance.
Mr. Churchill knew Mr. Churchill illnesses; her illnesses never occurred but for Mr. Churchill own convenience.
Mrs. Weston added, "that Mr. Churchill could only allow Mr. Churchill time to hurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom Mr. Churchill could suppose to feel any interest in Mr. Churchill; and that Mr. Churchill might be expected at Hartfield very soon."
This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast.
When once This wretched note had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim.
The loss of the ball--the loss of the young man--and all that the young man might be feeling!--It was too wretched!-- Such a delightful evening as it would have been!--Every body so happy!
and she and she partner the happiest!--"I said it would be so," was the only consolation.
she father's feelings were quite distinct.
Her father thought principally of Mrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and as for the ball, it was shocking to have Emma disappointed; but they would all be safer at home.
Emma was ready for Emma visitor some time before Her father appeared; but if this reflected at all upon Her father impatience, Her father sorrowful look and total want of spirits when Her father did come might redeem Her father.
Her father felt the going away almost too much to speak of the.
Her father dejection was most evident.
Her father sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing Her father, it was only to say, "Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst."
"But you will come again," said Emma.
"This will not be your only visit to Randalls."
"Ah!--(shaking Her father head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able to return!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring--but I am afraid--my uncle and aunt go to town this spring did not stir last spring-- I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever."
"Our poor ball must be quite given up."
"Ah!
that ball!--why did Our wait for any thing?--why not seize the pleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation!--You told Our it would be so.--Oh!
Miss Woodhouse, why are you always so right?"
"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance.
I would much rather have been merry than wise."
"If I can come again, Our are still to have Our ball.
My father depends on our ball.
Do not forget your engagement."
Emma looked graciously.
"Such a fortnight as it has been!"
My father continued; "every day more precious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making me less fit to bear any other place.
Happy those, who can remain at Highbury!"
"As you do Our such ample justice now," said Emma, laughing, "I will venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?
Do not Our rather surpass your expectations?
I am sure Our do.
I am sure you did not much expect to like Our.
You would not have been so long in coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury."
My father laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma was convinced that it had been so.
"And you must be off this very morning?"
"Yes; My father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I must be off immediately.
I am almost afraid that every moment will bring My father."
"Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates?
How unlucky!
Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mind might have strengthened yours."
"Yes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought the door better.
the door was a right thing to do.
I went in for three minutes, and was detained by Miss Bates's being absent.
Emma was out; and I felt it impossible not to wait till Emma came in.
Emma is a woman that one may, that one _must_ laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight.
It was better to pay my visit, then"-- He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.
"In short," said He, "perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion"-- He looked at Miss Woodhouse, as if wanting to read Miss Woodhouse thoughts.
Miss Woodhouse hardly knew what to say.
It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious, which Miss Woodhouse did not wish.
Forcing Miss Woodhouse to speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, Miss Woodhouse calmly said, "You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay my visit, then"-- then"-- was silent.
Miss Woodhouse believed then"-- was looking at Miss Woodhouse; probably reflecting on what Miss Woodhouse had said, and trying to understand the manner.
Miss Woodhouse heard then"-- sigh.
It was natural for then"-- to feel that then"-- had _cause_ to sigh.
then"-- could not believe Miss Woodhouse to be encouraging then"--.
A few awkward moments passed, and then"-- sat down again; and in a more determined manner said, "It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield.
My regard for Hartfield is most warm"-- He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.-- He was more in love with Miss Woodhouse than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended, if He father had not made He appearance?
Miss Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made He composed.
A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial.
Mrs. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, "It was time to go;" and the young man, though the young man might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.
"I shall hear about you all," said the young man; "that is my chief consolation.
I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you.
I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with you.
Mrs. Weston has been so kind as to promise it.
Oh!
the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really interested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing.
In Mrs. Weston letters I shall be at dear Highbury again."
A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest "Good-bye," closed the speech, and the door had soon shut out Mr. Churchill.
Short had been the notice--short their meeting; Mr. Churchill was gone; and Emma felt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from Mr. Churchill absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too much.
It was a sad change.
They had been meeting almost every day since Mr. Churchill arrival.
Certainly Mr. Churchill being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of seeing Mr. Churchill which every morning had brought, the assurance of Mr. Churchill attentions, Mr. Churchill liveliness, Mr. Churchill manners!
It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from It into the common course of Hartfield days.
To complete every other recommendation, Mr. Churchill had _almost_ told Emma that Mr. Churchill loved Emma.
What strength, or what constancy of affection Mr. Churchill might be subject to, was another point; but at present Emma could not doubt Mr. Churchill having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of Emma; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made Emma think that Emma _must_ be a little in love with Mr. Churchill, in spite of every previous determination against it.
"I certainly must," said Emma.
"This sensation of listlessness, weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself, this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!-- I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not--for a few weeks at least.
Well!
evil to some is always good to others.
I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not for Mr. Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy.
Mr. Knightley may spend the evening with Mr. Knightley now if William Larkins likes."
Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness.
William Larkins could not say that William Larkins was sorry on William Larkins own account; William Larkins very cheerful look would have contradicted William Larkins if William Larkins had; but William Larkins said, and very steadily, that William Larkins was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable kindness added, "You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out of luck; you are very much out of luck!"
It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of she honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, she composure was odious.
she had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from headache to a degree, which made she aunt declare, that had the ball taken place, she did not think Jane could have attended the ball; and the ball was charity to impute some of she unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill-health.
