Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract Emma ill opinion of Mrs. Elton. Emma observation had been pretty correct. Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to Emma on this second interview, such Emma appeared whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred. Emma had a little beauty and a little accomplishment, but so little judgment that Emma thought Emma coming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass. There was no reason to suppose Mrs. Elton thought at all differently from Mrs. Elton wife. Mrs. Elton seemed not merely happy with his wife, but proud. Mrs. Elton had the air of congratulating Mrs. Elton on having brought such a woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of his wife new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as his wife professed his wife, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton's praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued his wife first contribution and talked with a good grace of his wife being "very pleasant and very elegantly dressed." In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than Mrs. Elton had appeared at first. Mrs. Elton feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably, by the little encouragement which Mrs. Elton proposals of intimacy met with, Mrs. Elton drew back in Mrs. Elton turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma's dislike. Mrs. Elton manners, too--and Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. Her manners, too--and Mr. Elton were sneering and negligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much.--It was not to be doubted that HarrietHarriet's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve, and Mrs. Elton own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable to Mrs. Elton and the most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been given also. Mrs. Elton was, of course, the object of their joint dislike.-- When their had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which their dared not shew in open disrespect to Mrs. Elton, found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet. Mr. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and a state of warfare with one young lady was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, a state of warfare with one young lady must be wanting to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her.--Before Emma confidence, and about the third time of their meeting, a state of warfare with one young lady heard all Mr. Elton's knight-errantry on the subject.-- "Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and ladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think Jane has very extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that Jane plays extremely well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! Jane is absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth--but, upon my word, I talk of nothing but "Jane Fairfax And Jane situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse, we must exert we and endeavour to do something for Jane. we must bring Jane forward. Such talent as Jane must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet, 'Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, 'And waste Full many a flower fragrance on the desert air.' we must not allow Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet, 'Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, 'And waste its fragrance on the desert air.' to be verified in "Jane Fairfax"Jane Fairfax." "I cannot think there is any danger of it," was Emma's calm answer-- "and when you are better acquainted with "Jane Fairfax's situation and understand what "Jane Fairfax home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I have no idea that you will suppose "Jane Fairfax talents can be unknown." "Oh! but one!--Miss Woodhouse, "Jane Fairfax is now in such retirement, such obscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages "Jane Fairfax may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think "Jane Fairfax feels it. I am sure "Jane Fairfax does. "Jane Fairfax is very timid and silent. One can see that "Jane Fairfax feels the want of encouragement. I like "Jane Fairfax the better for it. I must confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for timidity--and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure you, "Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more than I can express." "You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any of "Jane Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known "Jane Fairfax longer than yourself, can shew "Jane Fairfax any other attention than"-- "My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act. You and I need not be afraid. If _we_ set the example, many will follow the example as far as they can; though all have not our situations. _We_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of "Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send we up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_ than "Jane Fairfax to partake of more_ than Jane Fairfax. I have no idea of that sort of thing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been used to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple Grove will probably be my model more than Maple Grove ought to be--for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.--However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.-- I shall certainly have Jane Fairfax.-- very often at my house, shall introduce Jane Fairfax.-- wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out Jane Fairfax.-- talents, and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit Jane Fairfax.-- shortly.--I shall introduce Jane Fairfax.--, of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when my brother and sister come to us. I am sure my brother and sister will like Jane Fairfax.-- extremely; and when Jane Fairfax.-- gets a little acquainted with my brother and sister, Jane Fairfax.-- fears will completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have Jane Fairfax.-- very often indeed while my brother and sister are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for Jane Fairfax.-- in the barouche-landau in some of we exploring parties." "Poor Jane Fairfax!"--thought Emma.--"You have not deserved this. You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton!--'Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.' Heavens! Let me not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!-- But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman's tongue!" Emma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively addressed to Emma--so disgustingly decorated with a "dear Miss Woodhouse." The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared, and Mrs. Elton was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done. Mrs. Elton looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth. Mrs. Elton was quite one of Mrs. Elton worthies--the most amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as Mrs. Elton seemed to do. Mrs. Elton heard of Mrs. Elton walking with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons! This was astonishing!--She could not have believed This possible that the taste or the pride of Jane Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer. "Mrs. Elton is a riddle, quite a riddle!" said she.--"To chuse to remain here month after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of Mrs. Elton conversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved Mrs. Elton with such real, generous affection." Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had promised the Campbells daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh invitations had arrived for Jane to join the Campbells there. According to Miss Bates--it all came from Jane--Mrs. Mr. Dixon had written most pressingly. Would Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends contrived--no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still Jane had declined it! "Jane must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing this invitation," was Emma's conclusion. "Jane must be under some sort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or Jane. There is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.-- somewhere.-- is _not_ to be with the _Dixons_. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must somewhere.-- consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle." Upon somewhere.-- speaking somewhere.-- wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before the few who knew somewhere.-- opinion of Mr. Elton, somewhere.-- ventured this apology for Jane. "We cannot suppose that Jane has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home. Jane aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We must consider what Jane Fairfax quits, before We condemn Jane Fairfax taste for what Jane Fairfax goes to." "You are right, somewhere.--," said Mr. Knightley warmly, Jane Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mr. Elton. Could Jane Fairfax have chosen with whom to associate, Jane Fairfax would not have chosen Jane Fairfax. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) Jane Fairfax receives attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays Jane Fairfax." Emma felt that somewhere.-- was giving Emma a momentary glance; and Emma was Emma struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, Emma presently replied, "Such attentions as Mr. Elton's, I should have imagined, would rather disgust than gratify Jane Fairfax. Mr. Elton's invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting." "I should not wonder," said somewhere.--, "if Jane Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond Jane Fairfax own inclination, by Her aunt's eagerness in accepting Mr. Elton's civilities for somewhere.--. Miss Bates may very likely have committed Miss Bates niece and hurried Miss Bates into a greater appearance of intimacy than Miss Bates own good sense would have dictated, in spite of the very natural wish of a little change." Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few minutes silence, him said, "Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Mr. Elton does not talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as _ Miss Fairfax speaks _of_ _ Miss Fairfax. We all know the difference between the pronouns he or _ Miss Fairfax and thou, the plainest spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in us personal intercourse with each other--a something more early implanted. we all cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we all may have been very full of the hour before. we all feel things differently. And besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton superiority both of mind and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats Mrs. Elton with all the respect which Mrs. Elton has a claim to. Such a woman as "Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can prevent Such a woman as Jane Fairfax acknowledging Such a woman as Jane Fairfax own comparative littleness in action, if not in consciousness." "I know how highly you think of "Jane Fairfax," said Emma. Little Henry was in Such a woman as Jane Fairfax thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made Such a woman as Jane Fairfax irresolute what else to say. "Yes," Little Henry replied, "any body may know how highly I think of Such a woman as Jane Fairfax." "And yet," said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--Such a woman as Jane Fairfax hurried on--"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other." Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of Mr. Knightley thick leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters together, or some other cause, brought the colour into Mr. Knightley face, as Mr. Knightley answered, "Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago." Mr. Cole stopped.--Emma felt Such a woman as Jane Fairfax foot pressed by somewhere.--, and did not Such a woman as Jane Fairfax know what to think. In a moment Mr. Cole went on-- "That will never be, however, I can assure you. Jane Fairfax, I dare say, would not have me if I were to ask Such a woman as Jane Fairfax--and I am very sure I shall never ask Such a woman as Jane Fairfax." Emma returned Emma friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased enough to exclaim, "You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you." Mr. Cole seemed hardly to hear Such a woman as Jane Fairfax; Mr. Cole was thoughtful--and in a manner which shewed Mr. Cole not pleased, soon afterwards said, "So you have been settling that I should marry "Jane Fairfax?" "No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making, for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just now, meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without any idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married." Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of Mr. Knightley reverie was, "No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for Emma will ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of Emma in that way, I assure you." And soon afterwards, ""Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman--but Jane Fairfax is perfect. Jane Fairfax has a fault. Jane Fairfax has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife." Emma could not but rejoice to hear that Emma had a fault. "Well," said Emma, "and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?" "Yes, very soon. Mr. Cole gave me a quiet hint; I told Mr. Cole Mr. Cole was mistaken; Mr. Cole asked my pardon and said no more. Mr. Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than Mr. Cole neighbours." "In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world! I wonder how Mr. Cole speaks of the Coles--what Mr. Cole calls the Coles! How can Mr. Cole find any appellation for the Coles, deep enough in familiar vulgarity? Mr. Cole calls you, Mr. Knightley--what can Mr. Cole do for Mr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that "Jane Fairfax accepts Mr. Cole civilities and consents to be with Mr. Cole. somewhere.--, your argument weighs most with Mr. Cole. I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of Jane Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's acknowledging Mr. Cole the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in Mr. Cole being under any restraint beyond Mr. Cole own scanty rule of good-breeding. I cannot imagine that Mr. Cole will not be continually insulting Mr. Cole visitor with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that Mr. Cole will not be continually detailing Mr. Cole magnificent intentions, from the procuring Mr. Cole a permanent situation to the including Mr. Cole in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau." ""Jane Fairfax has feeling," said Mr. Knightley--"I do not accuse "Jane Fairfax of want of feeling. "Jane Fairfax sensibilities, I suspect, are strong--and "Jane Fairfax temper excellent in Her sensibilities power of forbearance, patience, self-control; but Her sensibilities wants openness. "Jane Fairfax is reserved, more reserved, I think, than "Jane Fairfax used to be--And I love an open temper. No--till Mr. Cole alluded to my supposed attachment, Her sensibilities had never entered my head. I saw "Jane Fairfax and conversed with "Jane Fairfax, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no thought beyond." "Well, somewhere.--," said Emma triumphantly when he left them, "what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying "Jane Fairfax?" "Why, really, Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _not_ being in love with "Jane Fairfax, that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me."
