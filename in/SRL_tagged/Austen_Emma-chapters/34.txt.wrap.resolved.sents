Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was disposed to pay Mr. Elton attention on Mr. Elton marriage.
Dinner-parties and evening-parties were made for Mr. Elton and Mr. Elton lady; and invitations flowed in so fast that his lady had soon the pleasure of apprehending apprehending were never to have a disengaged day.
"I see how it is," said his lady.
"I see what a life I am to lead among you.
Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated.
we really seem quite the fashion.
If this is living in the country, this is nothing very formidable.
From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have been at a loss."
No invitation came amiss to his lady.
his lady Bath habits made evening-parties perfectly natural to his lady, and Maple Grove had given his lady a taste for dinners.
his lady was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury card-parties.
Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but his lady would soon shew Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others how every thing ought to be arranged.
In the course of the spring his lady must return Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others civilities by one very superior party--in which his lady card-tables should be set out with Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the evening than more waiters own establishment could furnish, to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.
Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons.
They must not do less than others, or Emma should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful resentment.
A dinner there must be.
After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for Mr. Woodhouse.
The persons to be invited, required little thought.
Besides the Eltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of course--and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it.
"Emma would rather not be in his company more than Emma could help.
Emma was not yet quite able to see his and his charming happy wife together, without feeling uncomfortable.
If Mr. Woodhouse would not be displeased, Mr. Woodhouse would rather stay at home."
It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had Emma deemed it possible enough for wishing.
Emma was delighted with the fortitude of Emma little friend--for fortitude Emma knew it was in Emma to give up being in company and stay at home; and Emma could now invite the very person whom Emma really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.-- Since Emma last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, Emma was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than Emma had often been.--Mr.
Knightley's words dwelt with Emma.
He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid Mrs. Elton.
"This is very true," said Mrs. Elton, "at least as far as relates to me, which was all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--and always knowing Mrs. Elton--I ought to have been more Mrs. Elton friend.-- Mrs. Elton will never like me now.
I have neglected Mrs. Elton too long.
But I will shew Mrs. Elton greater attention than I have done."
Every invitation was successful.
They were all disengaged and all happy.-- The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet over.
A circumstance rather unlucky occurred.
The two eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay The two eldest little Knightleys grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring, and The two eldest little Knightleys papa now proposed bringing The two eldest little Knightleys, and staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be the very day of this party.--His professional engagements did not allow of The two eldest little Knightleys being put off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by The two eldest little Knightleys happening so.
Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that Mr. Woodhouse nerves could bear--and here would be a ninth--and Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party.
Emma comforted Emma father better than Emma could comfort Emma, by representing that though Mr. Woodhouse certainly would make both father and daughter nine, yet Mr. Woodhouse always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very immaterial.
Emma thought it in reality a sad exchange for Emma, to have Mr. Woodhouse with Mr. Woodhouse grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to Emma instead of Mr. Woodhouse brother.
The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma.
John Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day.
John Knightley might be able to join both father and daughter in the evening, but certainly not to dinner.
Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease; and the seeing Mr. Woodhouse so, with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of his brother on hearing Mr. Woodhouse fate, removed the chief of even Emma's vexation.
The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and John Knightley seemed early to devote John Knightley to the business of being agreeable.
Instead of drawing John Knightley off to a window while the party waited for dinner, John Knightley was talking to Miss Fairfax.
Mrs. Elton, as elegant as lace and pearls could make Miss Fairfax, John Knightley looked at in silence-- wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and John Knightley could talk to Miss Fairfax.
John Knightley had met Miss Fairfax before breakfast as John Knightley was returning from a walk with John Knightley little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain.
It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and John Knightley said, "I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time.
I hope you turned directly."
"I went only to the post-office," said Miss Fairfax, "and reached home before the rain was much.
It is my daily errand.
I always fetch the letters when I am here.
the letters saves trouble, and is a something to get me out.
A walk before breakfast does me good."
"Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine."
"No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out."
Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied, "That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry and John had seen more drops than Henry and John could count long before.
the post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives.
When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for."
There was a little blush, and then this answer, "I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters."
"Indifferent!
Oh!
no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.
Letters are no matter of indifference; Letters are generally a very positive curse."
"You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of friendship."
"I have often thought them the worst of the two," replied he coolly.
"Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does."
"Ah!
you are not serious now.
I know Mr. John Knightley too well--I am very sure Mr. John Knightley understands the value of friendship as well as any body.
I can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than me which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation.
You have every body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than to-day."
"When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years," said Mr. John Knightley, "I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings.
I consider one as including the other.
Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you.
As an old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have."
It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence.
A pleasant "thank you" seemed meant to laugh It off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear in the eye, shewed that It was felt beyond a laugh.
Miss Fairfax attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on such occasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his particular compliments to the ladies, was ending with Miss Fairfax--and with all his mildest urbanity, said, "I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning in the rain.
Young ladies should take care of themselves.-- Young ladies are delicate plants.
Young ladies should take care of Young ladies health and Young ladies complexion.
My dear, did you change your stockings?"
"Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me."
"My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.-- I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well.
your good grand-mama and aunt are some of my very old friends.
I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour.
You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure.
My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield."
The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that The kind-hearted, polite old man had done The kind-hearted, polite old man duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.
By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and Mrs. Elton remonstrances now opened upon Jane.
"Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office in the rain!--This must not be, I assure the post-office in the rain!--This sad girl, how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of Jane."
Jane very patiently assured Jane that Jane had not caught any cold.
"Oh!
do not tell _me_.
You really are a very sad girl, and do not know how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed!
Mrs. Weston, did you ever hear the like?
You and I must positively exert our authority."
"My advice," said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, "I certainly do feel tempted to give.
Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.-- Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly careful, especially at this time of year.
The spring I always think requires more than common care.
Better wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your cough again.
Now do not you feel that you had?
Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable.
You look as if you would not do such a thing again."
"Oh!
Jane _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again," eagerly rejoined Mrs. Elton.
"We will not allow Jane to do such a thing again:"--and nodding significantly--"there must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.
I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches We letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and bring our men to yours.
That will obviate all difficulties you know; and from _us_ I really think, Jane, you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation."
"You are extremely kind," said Jane; "but I cannot give up my early walk.
I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before."
"Jane, say no more about it.
The thing is determined, that is (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master.
You know, Mrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how us express us.
But I do flatter Jane, Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out.
If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as settled."
"Excuse me," said Jane earnestly, "I cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant.
If the errand were not a pleasure to Jane, the errand were not a pleasure to me could be done, as the errand were not a pleasure to me always is when I am not here, by my grandmama's."
"Oh!
my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness to employ our men."
Jane looked as if Jane did not mean to be conquered; but instead of answering, Jane began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.
"the post-office is a wonderful establishment!"
said she.-- "The regularity and despatch of the post-office!
If one thinks of all that it has to do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!"
"it is certainly very well regulated."
"So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears!
So seldom that a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million, I suppose, actually lost!
And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad hands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder."
"The clerks grow expert from The clerks must begin with some quickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves some quickness of sight and hand.
If you want any farther explanation," continued he, smiling, "they are paid for it.
That is the key to a great deal of capacity.
The public pays and must be served well."
The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual observations made.
"I have heard it asserted," said John Knightley, "that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master teaches, it is natural enough.
But for that reason, I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have very little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand they can get.
Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike.
I have not always known Isabella and Emma writing apart."
"Yes," said his brother hesitatingly, "there is a likeness.
I know what you mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest."
"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully," said Mr. Woodhouse; "and always did.
And so does poor Mrs. Weston"--with half a sigh and half a smile at poor Mrs. Weston"--with.
"I never saw any gentleman's handwriting"--Emma began, looking also at Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending to some one else--and the pause gave Mrs. Weston time to reflect, "Now, how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people?
Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce I were very bad.--No name without the smallest distress.
I certainly get better and better.--Now for his name."
Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--"Mr. Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw."
"I do not admire it," said Mr. John Knightley.
"It is too small--wants strength.
It is like a woman's writing."
This was not submitted to by either lady.
They vindicated Frank Churchill against the base aspersion.
"No, it by no means wanted strength--it was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong.
Had Mrs. Weston any letter about Mrs. Weston to produce?"
No, Mrs. Weston had heard from Frank Churchill very lately, but having answered any letter about her to produce, had put any letter about her to produce away.
"If we were in the other room," said Emma, "if I had my writing-desk, I am sure I could produce a specimen.
I have a note of his.-- Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing Frank Churchill to write for you one day?"
"Frank Churchill chose to say Frank Churchill was employed"-- "Well, well, I have a note of his.--; and can shew a note of his.-- after dinner to convince Mr. John Knightley."
"Oh!
when a gallant young man, like Frank Churchill," said Mr. John Knightley dryly, "writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, Frank Churchill will, of course, put forth Frank Churchill best."
Dinner was on table.--Mrs.
Mrs. Elton, before Mrs. Elton could be spoken to, was ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached Mrs. Elton with Mr. Woodhouse request to be allowed to hand Mrs. Elton into the dining-parlour, was saying-- "Must I go first?
I really am ashamed of always leading the way."
Jane's solicitude about fetching Jane own letters had not escaped Emma.
Jane had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any.
Jane suspected that it _had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had not been in vain.
Jane thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual--a glow both of complexion and spirits.
Jane could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails;--it was at Jane tongue's end--but Jane abstained.
Jane was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Miss Fairfax feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each.
