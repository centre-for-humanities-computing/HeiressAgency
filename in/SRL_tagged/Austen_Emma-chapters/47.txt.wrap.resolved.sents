"Harriet, poor Harriet!"
--Those were the words; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted the real misery of the business to Emma.
Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by Emma--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _Frank Churchill_ behaviour as Emma _own_, which made Emma so angry with Frank Churchill.
It was the scrape which Frank Churchill had drawn Emma into on Harriet's account, that gave the deepest hue to Frank Churchill !
to be a second time the dupe of Harriet misconceptions and flattery.
Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically, when Mr. Knightley once said, "Emma, you have been no friend to Harriet Smith."
--She was afraid Harriet Smith."
--She had done Harriet Smith."
--She nothing but disservice.--It was true that Harriet Smith."
--She had not to charge Harriet Smith."
--She, in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged Harriet admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before Harriet had ever given Harriet a hint on the subject; but Harriet felt completely guilty of having encouraged what Harriet might have repressed.
Harriet might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments.
Harriet influence would have been enough.
And now Harriet was very conscious that Harriet ought to have prevented them.--She felt that Harriet had been risking Harriet friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds.
Common sense would have directed Harriet to tell Harriet, that Harriet must not allow Harriet to think of him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against him ever caring for her.--"But, with common sense," Harriet added, "I am afraid I have had little to do."
Harriet was extremely angry with Harriet.
If Harriet could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.-- As for Jane Fairfax, Harriet might at least relieve Harriet feelings from any present solicitude on Harriet account.
Harriet would be anxiety enough; Harriet need no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.-- Emma could now imagine why Harriet own attentions had been slighted.
This discovery laid many smaller matters open.
No doubt This discovery had been from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes jealousy.--In Jane's had been a rival; and well might any thing jealousy.--In Jane's could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed.
An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack, and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison.
jealousy.--In Jane's understood it all; and as far as jealousy.--In Jane's mind could disengage it all from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, jealousy.--In Jane's acknowledged that jealousy.--In Jane's would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond jealousy.--In Jane's desert.
But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge!
There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else.
prosperous.-- Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.
Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by it apparently stronger effect on poor Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.-- prosperous.-- Emma must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon as possible.
An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's parting words.
"For the present, the whole affair was to be completely a secret.
Mr. Churchill had made a point of it, as a token of respect to the wife Mr. Churchill had so very recently lost; and every body admitted it to be no more than due prosperous.-- Emma had promised; but still poor Harriet must be excepted.
It was poor Harriet superior duty.
In spite of poor Harriet vexation, poor Harriet could not help feeling it almost ridiculous, that poor Harriet should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by poor Harriet.
The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to poor Harriet, poor Harriet was now to be anxiously announcing to another.
poor Harriet heart beat quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, poor Harriet supposed, had poor Mrs. Weston felt when _poor Harriet_ was approaching Randalls.
Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!-- But of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.
"Well, Miss Woodhouse!"
cried poor Harriet, coming eagerly into the room-- "is not this the oddest news that ever was?"
"What news do you mean?"
replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or voice, whether poor Harriet could indeed have received any hint.
"About Jane Fairfax.
Did you ever hear any thing so strange?
Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning Oh!--you to me, for poor Mrs. Weston has told me poor Mrs. Weston.
I met poor Mrs. Weston just now.
poor Mrs. Weston told me it was to be a great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you, but poor Mrs. Weston said you knew it."
"What did poor Mrs. Weston tell you?"
--said Emma, still perplexed.
"Oh!
poor Mrs. Weston told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married, and that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill have been privately engaged to one another this long while.
How very odd!"
It was, indeed, so odd; poor Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd, that Emma did not know how to understand it.
Emma character appeared absolutely changed.
Emma seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery.
Emma looked at Emma, quite unable to speak.
"Had you any idea," cried poor Harriet, "of poor Harriet being in love with her?--You, perhaps, might.--You (blushing as Emma spoke) who can see into every body's heart; but nobody else--" "Upon my word," said Emma, "I begin to doubt my having any such talent.
Can you seriously ask me, poor Harriet, whether I imagined poor Harriet attached to another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not openly-- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax.
You may be very sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly."
"Me!"
cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished.
"Why should you caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill."
"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject," replied Emma, smiling; "but you do not mean to deny that there was a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about Mr. Frank Churchill?"
"Him!--never, never.
Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?"
turning away distressed.
poor Harrietpoor Harriet!"
cried Emma, after a moment's pause--"What do you mean?-- Good Heaven!
what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--" Dear Miss Woodhouse could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and Dear Miss Woodhouse sat down, waiting in great terror till poor Harriet should answer.
Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from Dear Miss Woodhouse, did not immediately say any thing; and when Dear Miss Woodhouse did speak, it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.
"I should not have thought it possible," Dear Miss Woodhouse began, "that you could have misunderstood me!
I know we agreed never to name Mr. Frank Churchill--but considering how infinitely superior Mr. Frank Churchill is to every body else, I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person.
Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed!
I do not know who would ever look at Mr. Frank Churchill in the company of the other.
I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side.
And that you should have been so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost, to dare to think of Mr. Frank Churchill.
At first, if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater disparity (those were your very words);-- I should not have dared to give way to--I should not have thought it possible--But if _you_, who had been always acquainted with him--" "Harriet!"
cried Emma, collecting Emma resolutely--"Let us understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake.
Are you speaking of--Mr.
Knightley?"
"To be sure I am.
I never could have an idea of any body else--and so I thought you knew.
When us talked about Mr. Frank Churchill, it was as clear as possible."
"Not quite," returned Emma, with forced calmness, "for all that you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person.
I could almost assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill.
I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of."
"Oh!
Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!"
"" "Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion.
I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing he come forward to your rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory."
"Oh, dear," cried " "Harriet, "now I recollect what you mean; but I was thinking of something very different at the time.
It was not the gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant.
No!
(with some elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room.
That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior Mr. Frank Churchill was to every other being upon earth."
"Good God!"
cried prosperous.-- Emma, "this has been a most unfortunate--most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?"
"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me?
At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the other had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--" She paused a few moments.
prosperous.-- Emma could not speak.
"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse," Miss Woodhouse resumed, "that you should feel a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body.
You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other.
But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--strange as it may appear--.
But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before--and if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to--if Mr. Knightley should really--if _Mr.
Knightley_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, Dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way.
But you are too good for that, I am sure."
Harriet was standing at one of the windows.
Emma turned round to look at Harriet in consternation, and hastily said, "Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?"
"Yes," replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--"I must say that I have."
Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and Emma sat silently meditating, in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes.
A few minutes were sufficient for making Emma acquainted with Emma own heart.
A mind like hers, once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.
Emma touched--Emma admitted--Emma acknowledged the whole truth.
Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Mr. Frank Churchill?
Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet's having some hope of a return?
It darted through Emma, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but Emma!
Emma own conduct, as well as Emma own heart, was before Emma in the same few minutes.
Emma saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed Emma before.
How improperly had Emma been acting by poor Harriet!
How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been Emma conduct!
What blindness, what madness, had led Emma on!
What blindness struck Emma with dreadful force, and Emma was ready to give What blindness every bad name in the world.
Some portion of respect for Emma, however, in spite of all these demerits--some concern for Emma own appearance, and a strong sense of justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed Emma loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required that Emma should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent kindness.--For Emma own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained--or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led Harriet right.-- Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing Harriet emotion, Harriet turned to poor Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.-- Neither of whose counsels thought but of Mr. Knightley and whose counsels.
Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give the history of Harriet hopes with great, though trembling delight.--Emma's tremblings as Harriet asked, and as Harriet listened, were better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not less.
Harriet voice was not unsteady; but Harriet mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.-- Harriet listened with much inward suffering, but with great outward patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or well arranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be; but it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink Harriet spirit--especially with the corroborating circumstances, which Harriet own memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.
Harriet had been conscious of a difference in Harriet behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that Harriet had, on the occasion, found Harriet much superior to Harriet expectation.
From that evening, or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging Harriet to think of Harriet, Harriet had begun to be sensible of Harriet talking to Harriet much more than Harriet had been used to do, and of Harriet having indeed quite a different manner towards Harriet; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly Harriet had been more and more aware of it.
When they had been all walking together, Harriet had so often come and walked by Harriet, and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with Harriet.
Emma knew it to have been very much the case.
Emma had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from Harriet--and Emma felt almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him to be in the closest agreement with what Emma had known of Harriet opinion of Harriet.
Harriet praised Emma for being without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.-- Emma knew that Harriet saw such recommendations in Harriet; Harriet had dwelt on almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him to Emma more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's memory, many little particulars of the notice Emma had received from Harriet, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected, by Emma.
Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation, and contained multiplied proofs to Emma who had seen almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him, had passed undiscerned by Emma who now heard almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first, was Harriet walking with Emma apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him had been walking some time before Emma came, and Harriet had taken pains (as Emma was convinced) to draw Emma from the rest to Harriet--and at first, Harriet had talked to Emma in a more particular way than Harriet had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.)
Harriet seemed to be almost asking Emma, whether Emma affections were engaged.-- But as soon as Emma (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them, Harriet changed the subject, and began talking about farming:-- The second, was Harriet having sat talking with Emma nearly half an hour before Emma came back from Emma visit, the very last morning of Harriet being at Hartfield--though, when Harriet first came in, Harriet had said that Harriet could not stay five minutes--and Harriet having told Emma, during their conversation, that though Harriet must go to London, it was very much against Harriet inclination that Harriet left home at all, which was much more (as Emma felt) than Harriet had acknowledged to _her_.
The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave Emma severe pain.
On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, Emma did, after a little reflection, venture the following question.
"Might Harriet not?--Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of your affections, Harriet might be alluding to Mr. Martin--Harriet might have Mr. Martin's interest in view?
But Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit.
"Mr. Martin!
No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin.
I hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it."
When Harriet had closed Harriet evidence, Harriet appealed to Harriet dear Miss Woodhouse, to say whether Harriet had not good ground for hope.
"I never should have presumed to think of it at first," said Harriet, "but for you.
You told me to observe Harriet carefully, and let Harriet behaviour be the rule of mine--and so I have.
But now I seem to feel that I may deserve Harriet; and that if Harriet does chuse me, it will not be any thing so very wonderful."
The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to enable Emma to say on reply, poor Harrietpoor Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of Mr. Knightley feeling for any woman more than Mr. Knightley really does."
Harriet seemed ready to worship Harriet friend for a sentence so satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of Emma father's footsteps.
Mr. Knightley was coming through the hall.
Harriet was too much agitated to encounter Mr. Knightley.
"Harriet could not compose herself-- her dear Miss Woodhouse would be alarmed--Harriet had better go;"--with most ready encouragement from her friend, therefore, Harriet passed off through another door--and the moment Harriet was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of Emma's feelings: "Oh God!
that I had never seen Harriet!"
The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for Harriet thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on Harriet within the last few hours.
Every moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her.--How to understand it all!
How to understand the deceptions Harriet had been thus practising on Harriet, and living under!--The blunders, the blindness of Harriet own head and heart!--she sat still, heart!--she walked about, heart!--she tried heart!--she own room, heart!--she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every posture, Harriet perceived that Harriet had acted most weakly; that Harriet had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that Harriet had been imposing on Harriet in a degree yet more mortifying; that Harriet was wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.
To understand, thoroughly understand Harriet own heart, was the first endeavour.
To that point went every leisure moment which heart!--she father's claims on heart!--she allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.
How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to Harriet, as every feeling declared Mr. Knightley now to be?
When had Mr. Knightley influence, such influence begun?-- When had Mr. Knightley succeeded to that place in Harriet affection, which Frank Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back; Harriet compared the two--compared her affection, which Frank Churchill had once, as her affection, which Frank Churchill had once had always stood in Harriet estimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to her-- and as her affection, which Frank Churchill had once must at any time have been compared by Harriet, had it--oh!
had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to Harriet, to institute the comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when Harriet did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when Mr. Knightley regard for Harriet had not been infinitely the most dear.
Harriet saw, that in persuading Harriet, in fancying, in acting to the contrary, Harriet had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant of Harriet own heart--and, in short, that Harriet had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all!
This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection.
This was the knowledge of Harriet, on the first question of inquiry, which Harriet reached; and without being long in reaching it.-- Harriet was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to Harriet--Harriet affection for Mr.
Knightley.-- Every other part of Harriet mind was disgusting.
With insufferable vanity had Harriet believed Harriet in the secret of every body's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body's destiny.
Harriet was proved to have been universally mistaken; and Harriet had not quite done nothing--for Harriet had done mischief.
Harriet had brought evil on Harriet, on Harriet, and Harriet too much feared, on Mr.
Knightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on Harriet must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for Mr.
Knightley.--Were attachment, Harriet must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet's;--and even were this not the case, Mr.
Knightley.--Were would never have known Harriet at all but for Harriet folly.
Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or thought.--Mr.
Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an elevation on Mr. Knightley side!
Such a debasement on Mr.
Knightley.--Were!
It was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink Mr.
Knightley.--Were in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at Mr.
Knightley.--Were expense; the mortification and disdain of Mr.
Knightley.--Were brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself.--Could it be?--No; it was impossible.
And yet it was far, very far, from impossible.--Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers?
Was it new for one, perhaps too busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent, incongruous--or for chance and circumstance (as second causes) to direct the human fate?
Oh!
had Emma never brought Harriet forward!
Had Emma left Harriet where Emma ought, and where he had told Emma Emma ought!--Had Emma not, with a folly which no tongue could express, prevented Emma marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made Emma happy and respectable in the line of life to which Emma ought to belong--all would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.
How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise Harriet thoughts to Mr.
Knightley!--How Harriet could dare to fancy Harriet the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!-- But Harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.-- Harriet inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.-- Harriet had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton's being to stoop in marrying Harriet, than Harriet now seemed of Mr.
Knightley's.-- Alas!
was not that Harriet own doing too?
Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who but Harriet had taught Harriet, that Harriet was to elevate Harriet if possible, and that Harriet claims were great to a high worldly establishment?-- If Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was Harriet doing too.
