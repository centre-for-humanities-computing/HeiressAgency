Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must compose Elton joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse Mr. John Knightley ill-humour. Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew Elton just as happy as Elton was. To Elton it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons. Mrs. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the world to whom Mrs. Weston spoke with such unreserve, as to Mrs. Weston wife; not any one, to whom his wife related with such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of his wife father and his wife. his wife could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each. This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston, his wife smile, his wife touch, his wife voice was grateful to Emma, and his wife determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost. The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through before his wife arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of Mr. Woodhouse own and Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just got to the end of Mr. Woodhouse satisfaction that James should come and see James daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost wholly engrossed by Emma attentions to James, was able to turn away and welcome Emma. Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made Emma rather sorry to find, when they had all taken they places, that Mr. Woodhouse was close to Emma. The difficulty was great of driving Mr. Woodhouse strange insensibility towards Harriet, from Emma mind, while Mr. Woodhouse not only sat at Emma elbow, but was continually obtruding Mr. Woodhouse happy countenance on Emma notice, and solicitously addressing Emma upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting Mr. Woodhouse, Mr. Woodhouse behaviour was such that Emma could not avoid the internal suggestion of "Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be possible for Mr. Woodhouse to be beginning to transfer Mr. Woodhouse affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!"-- Yet Mr. Woodhouse would be so anxious for Emma being perfectly warm, would be so interested about Emma father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring Emma drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with Emma to preserve Emma good manners. For Emma own sake Emma could not be rude; and for Harriet's, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, Emma was even positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense, which Emma particularly wished to listen to. Emma heard enough to know that Mrs. Weston was giving some information about Mrs. Weston son; Emma heard the words "my son," and "Frank," and "my son," repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected that Mrs. Weston was announcing an early visit from his son; but before Emma could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from Emma would have been awkward. Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill, which always interested Emma. Emma had frequently thought--especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that if Emma _were_ to marry, his was the very person to suit Emma in age, character and condition. his seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to Emma. Emma could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it, Emma was very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a situation which Emma believed more replete with good than any Emma could change it for, Emma had a great curiosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it being coupled in Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it friends' imaginations. With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed; but Mr. Elton's civilities had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the substance of the same information, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So the same information proved;--for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at dinner, Mr. Elton's civilities made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to Mr. Elton's civilities, "We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my son--and then I should say We were quite complete. I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that We are expecting Frank. I had a letter from Frank this morning, and Frank will be with We within a fortnight." Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith party quite complete. "his has been wanting to come to We," continued Mr. Weston, "ever since September: every letter has been full of every letter; but his cannot command his own time. his has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between We) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices. But now I have no doubt of seeing his here about the second week in January." "What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mr. Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with his, that Mr. Weston must be almost as happy as yourself." "Yes, Mr. Weston would be, but that Mr. Weston thinks there will be another put-off. Mr. Weston does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but Mr. Weston does not know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is--(but this is quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room. There are secrets in all families, The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. If their are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know their will, because it is a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite their once in two or three years, their always are put off when it comes to the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) at Hartfield, that your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) cannot calculate on your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing." "I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case," replied Emma; "but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think Mr. Weston will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe." "Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow myself to speak ill of your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table), on Frank's account; for I do believe your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) to be very fond of Frank. I used to think your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) was not capable of being fond of any body, except your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table): but your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) has always been kind to Frank (in your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) way--allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing to be as your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to Frank, that Frank should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it to any body else, your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) has no more heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper." Emma liked the subject so well, that Emma began upon the subject, to Mrs. Weston, very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing Emma joy--yet observing, that Emma knew the first meeting must be rather Mrs. Weston agreed to the first meeting; but added, that Emma should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of: "for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?" "Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs. Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world." "Emma!" replied Mr. Weston, smiling, "what is the certainty of caprice?" Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending before--"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as Mr. Frank Churchill thinks. It depends entirely upon Mr. Frank Churchill aunt's spirits and pleasure; in short, upon Emma temper. To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on the truth. Mr. Frank Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman; and Mr. Frank Churchill coming now, depends upon a very odd-tempered woman being willing to spare Mr. Frank Churchill." "Oh, Mr. Frank Churchill; every body knows Mr. Frank Churchill," replied Isabella: "and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she never had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made Poor little creatures!" Emma wished Emma had been alone with Mr. Weston. Emma should then have heard more: Mr. Weston would speak to Emma, with a degree of unreserve which Emma would not hazard with Isabella; and, Emma really believed, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from Emma, excepting those views on the young man, of which Emma own imagination had already given Emma such instinctive knowledge. But at present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner, was a confinement that Mr. Woodhouse could not endure. Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to Mr. Woodhouse; and gladly did Mr. Woodhouse move to those with whom Mr. Woodhouse was always comfortable. While Mr. Woodhouse talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of saying, "And so you do not consider this visit from his son as by any means certain. I am sorry for this visit from your son. The introduction must be unpleasant, whenever The introduction takes place; and the sooner this visit from your son could be over, the better." "Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on Mr. Woodhouse side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills' to keep Mr. Woodhouse to Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off. There is jealousy. Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off are jealous even of Mr. Woodhouse regard for Mr. Woodhouse . In short, I can feel no dependence on Mr. Woodhouse coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine." "Mr. Woodhouse ought to come," said Emma. "If Mr. Woodhouse could stay only a couple of days, Mr. Woodhouse ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having it in Mr. Woodhouse power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_'s being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if his likes it." "One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before one decides upon what he can do," replied Mr. Weston. "One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to she." "But she is so fond of the nephew: the nephew is so very great a favourite. Now, according to my idea of Mr. Frank Churchill, it would be most natural, that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards _the husband_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes nothing at all." "Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for a bad one: you must let a bad one go a bad one own way. I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for his to know beforehand _when_ it will be." Emma listened, and then coolly said, "I shall not be satisfied, unless his comes." "his may have a great deal of influence on some points," continued Mr. Weston, "and on others, very little: and among those, on which Mr. Weston is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of his coming away from those to visit us."
