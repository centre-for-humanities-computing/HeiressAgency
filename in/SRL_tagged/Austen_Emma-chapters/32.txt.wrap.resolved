Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and a bride in a pew must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to settle whether Mrs. Elton were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or not pretty at all. Mrs. Elton had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make Mrs. Elton resolve on not being the last to pay Mrs. Elton respects; and Mrs. Elton made a point of Harriet's going with Mrs. Elton, that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible. Mrs. Elton could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to which Mrs. Elton had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to lace up Mrs. Elton boot, without _recollecting_. A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but poor Harriet behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The visit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten The visit, that Mrs. Elton would not allow Mrs. Elton entirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being "elegantly dressed, and very pleasing." poor Harriet did not really like poor Harriet. poor Harriet would not be in a hurry to find fault, but poor Harriet suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.-- poor Harriet was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there was too much ease. poor Harriet person was rather good; poor Harriet face not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Mrs. Elton thought at least it would turn out so. As for Mr. Elton, Mr. Elton manners did not appear--but no, Mrs. Elton would not permit a hasty or a witty word from Mrs. Elton about his manners. It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man had need be all grace to acquit a man well through It. Mrs. Elton was better off; Mrs. Elton might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the privilege of bashfulness, but a man had only a man own good sense to depend on; and when Mrs. Elton considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman Mr. Elton had just married, the woman Mr. Elton had wanted to marry, and the woman whom Mr. Elton had been expected to marry, Mrs. Elton must allow Mr. Elton to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as could be. "Well, Miss Woodhouse," said Harriet, when they had quitted the house, and after waiting in vain for Mrs. Elton friend to begin; "Well, Miss Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?-- Is not Mrs. Elton very charming?" There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer. "Oh! yesMrs. Elton." "I think Mrs. Elton beautiful, quite beautiful." "Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown." "I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love." "Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; and Mrs. Elton came in he way." "I dare say," returned Harriet, sighing again, "I dare say Mrs. Elton was very much attached to he." "Perhaps Mrs. Elton might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman who loves he best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this the best offer Miss Hawkins was likely to have." "Yes," said Harriet earnestly, "and well Miss Hawkins might, nobody could ever have a better. Well, I wish nobody happy with all my heart. And now, Miss Hawkins, I do not think I shall mind seeing nobody again. he is just as superior as ever;--but being married, you know, it is quite a different thing. No, indeed, Miss Hawkins, you need not be afraid; I can sit and admire he now without any great misery. To know that he has not thrown he away, is such a comfort!-- Miss Hawkins does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves. Happy creature! he called Miss Hawkins 'Augusta.' How delightful!" When the visit was returned, Emma made up Emma mind. Emma could then see more and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be at Hartfield, and Emma father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, Emma had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to Emma, and could composedly attend to Emma; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced Emma that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with Emma, and thinking much of Emma own importance; that Emma meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all Emma notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living; that if not foolish Emma was ignorant, and that Emma society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good. Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined Harriet, Harriet would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it might be fairly supposed from Harriet easy conceit, had been the best of Harriet own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance, and The rich brother-in-law near Bristol place and The rich brother-in-law near Bristol carriages were the pride of The rich brother-in-law near Bristol. The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, Mrs. Elton. The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that Mrs. Elton could see or imagine. "Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at Maple Grove; Mrs. Elton sister's favourite room."-- Mrs. Elton was appealed to.--"Was not Maple Grove indeed!--She astonishingly like?-- Mrs. Elton could really almost fancy Mrs. Elton at Maple Grove." "And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the staircase-- was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Mrs. Elton, it is very delightful to Mrs. Elton, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body who sees it is struck by Every body who sees it beauty; but to Mrs. Elton, Every body who sees it has been quite a home. Whenever you are transplanted, like Mrs. Elton, Mrs. EltonMrs. Elton, you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony." Emma made as slight a reply as Emma could; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking Emma. "So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house--the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like. The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand very much in the same way--just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in mind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People who have extensive grounds People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style." Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. Emma had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds people who had extensive grounds cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply, "When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties." "Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. Surry is the garden of England, you know. Surry is the garden of EnglandEngland." "Yes; but we must not rest we claims on that distinction. Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as Surry." "No, I fancy not," replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile." I never heard any county but Surry called so." Emma was silenced. "My brother and sister have promised we a visit in the spring, or summer at farthest," continued Mrs. Elton; "and that will be we time for exploring. While My brother and sister are with we, we shall explore a great deal, I dare say. My brother and sister will have My brother and sister barouche-landau, of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _we_ carriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well. the different beauties would hardly come in the different beauties chaise, I think, at that season of the year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend the different beauties bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable. When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes people to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. we explored to King's-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the barouche-landau. You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?" "No; not immediately here. we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure." "Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when Selina has been going to Bristol, 'I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely must go in by Selina, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with Selina own good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.' Many a time has Selina said so; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary, when people shut people up entirely from society, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little. I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--(looking towards Miss Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must be a great drawback. Why does not Your father's state of health try Bath?--Indeed Your father's state of health should. Let me recommend Bath to Woodhouse. I assure you I have no doubt of Bath doing Miss Woodhouse good." "her father tried Bath more than once, formerly; but without receiving any benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to Woodhouse, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now." "Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief Miss Woodhouse, where the waters do agree give. In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of use to Miss Woodhouse's spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its recommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on _. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public with." It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea of Emma being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an _introduction_--of introduction_--of going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!-- The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed! introduction_--of restrained introduction_--of, however, from any of the reproofs introduction_--of could have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; "but their going to Bath was quite out of the question; and introduction_--of was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit introduction_--of better than introduction_--of ." And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly. "I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these occasions, a lady's character generally precedes introduction_--of; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer." "Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior performer!--very far from A superior performer!--very, I assure you. Consider from how partial a quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of music--passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Mrs. Elton, I well know, play delightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got into. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life to me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when Mr. E. was speaking of my future home, and expressing Mr. E. fears lest the retirement of his fears should be disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had been accustomed to--of course Mr. E. was not wholly without apprehension. When Mr. E. was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_ _world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of retirement. Blessed with so many resources within me, the world was not necessary to _me_. I could do very well without the world. To those who had no resources the world was a different thing; but my resources made me quite independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I really could not give the world a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure Mr. E. that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments. 'But,' said I, 'to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without something of a musical society. I condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a blank to me.'" "two carriages were not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments cannot suppose," said Emma, smiling, "that Mrs. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned, in consideration of the motive." "No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to find Mrs. Elton in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together. I think, Mrs. Elton, you and I must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or we. Will not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert we, I think we shall not be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know--there is a sad story against married women, in general. married women are but too apt to give up music." "But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no danger, surely?" "I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music--never touches the instrument--though Selina played sweetly. And the same may be said of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. Upon my word my word is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call a married woman attention. I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper." "But every thing of that kind," said Emma, "will soon be in so regular a train--" "Well," said Mrs. Elton, laughing, "we shall see." Emma, finding Emma so determined upon neglecting Emma music, had nothing more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton chose another subject. "We have been calling at Randalls," said Mrs. Elton, "and found them both at home; and very pleasant people them seem to be. I like them extremely. King's-Weston seems an excellent creature--quite a first-rate favourite with King's-Weston already, I assure you. And _Mrs. Elton_ appears so truly good--there is something so motherly and kind-hearted about Mrs. Elton, that she_ wins upon one directly. Mrs. Elton was your governess, I think?" Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before Mrs. Elton went on. "Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find Mrs. Elton so very lady-like! But Mrs. Elton is really quite the gentlewoman." "Mrs. Weston's manners," said Emma, "were always particularly good. Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make Their the safest model for any young woman." "And who do you think came in while we were there?" Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance--and how could Emma possibly guess? "Knightley!" continued Mrs. Elton; "Knightley himself!--Was not it lucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never seen he before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.'s, I had a great curiosity. 'My friend Knightley' had been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see My friend Knightley'; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that My friend Knightley' need not be ashamed of My friend Knightley'. Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like My friend Knightley' very much. Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man." Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could breathe. "Insufferable woman!" was Emma immediate exclamation. "Worse than I had supposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!--I could not have believed Knightley!--I. Knightley!--never seen Knightley!--I in Knightley!--never life before, and call Knightley!--I Knightley!--and discover that Knightley!--I is a gentleman! A little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_, and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery. Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether Mr. Knightley is a gentleman will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could not have believed the compliment! And to propose that her and I should unite to form a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs. Weston!-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyond my hopes. Knightley!--never is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank Churchill say to Knightley!--never, if Frank Churchill were here? How angry and how diverted Frank Churchill would be! Ah! there I am--thinking of Frank Churchill directly. Always the first person to be thought of! How I catch Frank Churchill out! Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind!"-- All this ran so glibly through Knightley!--never thoughts, that by the time Knightley!--never had arranged Frank Churchill, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure, and was ready to speak, Knightley!--never was very tolerably capable of attending. "Well, my dear," Frank Churchill deliberately began, "considering we never saw Knightley!--never before, Knightley!--never seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say Knightley!--never was very much pleased with you. Knightley!--never speaks a little too quick. A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor. However, Knightley!--never seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think him had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer. But I ought to have gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! a bride shews what a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane." "I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mrs. Elton knows you." "Yes: but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects to a young lady--a bride if possible. It was being very deficient." "But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_? It ought to be no recommendation to _you_. It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of people." "No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride, especially, is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to _her_. A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who the others may." "Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what is. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies." "my dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry." Emma had done. Emma was growing nervous, and could not understand _her_. Emma mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences, and long, very long, did Mrs. Elton's offences occupy Emma.
