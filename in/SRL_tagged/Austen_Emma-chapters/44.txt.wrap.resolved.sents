The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all the evening.
How it might be considered by the rest of the party, Emma could not tell.
They, in They different homes, and They different ways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in Emma view it was a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than any Emma had ever passed.
A whole evening of back-gammon with Emma father, was felicity to it.
_There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for there Emma was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem, Emma could not, in Emma general conduct, be open to any severe reproach.
As a daughter, Emma hoped Emma was not without a heart.
Emma hoped no one could have said to Emma, "How could you be so unfeeling to your father?-- I must, I will tell you truths while I can."
Miss Bates should never again--no, never!
If attention, in future, could do away the past, Emma might hope to be forgiven.
Emma had been often remiss, Emma conscience told Emma so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact; scornful, ungracious.
But it should be so no more.
In the warmth of true contrition, Emma would call upon Emma the very next morning, and it should be the beginning, on Emma side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.
Emma was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that nothing might prevent Emma.
It was not unlikely, Emma thought, that Emma might see Mr. Knightley in Emma way; or, perhaps, Mr. Knightley might come in while Emma were paying Emma visit.
Emma had no objection.
Emma would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.
Emma eyes were towards Donwell as Emma walked, but Emma saw Donwell not.
"The ladies were all at home."
Emma had never rejoiced at the sound before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs, with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.
There was a bustle on Emma approach; a good deal of moving and talking.
Emma heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped Emma would be pleased to wait a moment, and then ushered Emma in too soon.
The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room.
Jane Jane had a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut The aunt and niece out, Jane heard Miss Bates Bates saying, "Well, my dear, I shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough."
Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if Jane did not quite understand what was going on.
"I am afraid Jane is not very well," said Jane, "but I do not know; they _tell_ me Jane is well.
I dare say Jane will be here presently, Miss Bates.
I hope you find a chair.
I wish Hetty had not gone.
I am very little able--Have you a chair, ma'am?
Do you sit where you like?
I am sure Jane will be here presently."
Emma seriously hoped Emma would.
Emma had a moment's fear of Miss Bates keeping away from Emma.
But Miss Miss Bates soon came--"Very happy and obliged"--but Emma's conscience told Emma that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner.
A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, Emma hoped, might lead the way to a return of old feelings.
The touch seemed immediate.
"Ah!
Miss Bates, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--and are come to give us joy.
This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be very trying for us to part with Emma, after having had Emma so long, and Emma has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:--such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon.
'My dear,' said I, 'you will blind yourself'--for tears were in Emma eyes perpetually.
One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder.
It is a great change; and though Emma is amazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out--do not think us ungrateful, Miss Bates, for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing Emma tears)--but, poor dear soul!
if you were to see what a headache Emma has.
When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve.
Emma is as low as possible.
To look at Emma, nobody would think how delighted and happy Emma is to have secured such a situation.
You will excuse Emma not coming to you--Emma is not able--Emma is gone into Emma own room--I want Emma to lie down upon the bed.
'My dear,' said I, 'I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:' but, however, Emma is not; Emma is walking about her own room.
But, now that Emma has written Emma letters, Emma says Emma shall soon be well.
Emma will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will excuse Emma.
You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite ashamed--but somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not know any body was coming.
'It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I, 'depend upon it.
Nobody else would come so early.'
'Well,' said Emma, 'it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.'
But then Emma came in, and said it was you.
'Oh!'
said I, 'it is Miss Woodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her.'
-- 'I can see nobody,' said Emma; and up Emma got, and would go away; and that was what made we keep you waiting--and extremely sorry and ashamed we were.
'If you must go, my dear,' said I, 'you must, and I will say you are laid down upon the bed.'"
Emma was most sincerely interested.
Emma heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane; and this picture of Emma present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left Emma nothing but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past, obliged Emma to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when Emma might not bear to see Emma.
Emma spoke as Emma felt, with earnest regret and solicitude--sincerely wishing that the circumstances which Emma collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage and comfort as possible.
"It must be a severe trial to them all.
Emma had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell's return."
"So very kind!"
replied Miss Bates.
"But you are always kind."
There was no bearing such an "always;" and to break through Emma dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of-- "Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?"
"To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have the charge of Emma three little girls--delightful children.
Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps, Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's; but a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior-- is intimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove.
Jane will be only four miles from Maple GroveMaple Grove."
"Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--" "Yes, we good Mrs. Elton.
The most indefatigable, true friend.
Jane would not take a denial.
Jane would not let Jane say, 'No;' for when Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, Jane was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactly as you say, Jane had made up Jane mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell's return, and nothing should induce Jane to enter into any engagement at present--and so Jane told Mrs. Elton over and over again--and I am sure I had no more idea that Jane would change Jane mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails Jane, saw farther than I did.
It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as Jane did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but Jane positively declared Jane would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished Jane; Jane would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go.
Quite a surprize to Jane!
I had not the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told Mrs. Elton at once, that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation, Mrs. Elton had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it.--I till it was all settled."
"You spent the evening with Mrs.
Elton?"
"Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come.
It was settled so, upon the hill, while us were walking about with Mr. Knightley.
'You _must_ _all_ spend your evening with us,' said she--'I positively must have you _all_ come.'"
"Mr. Knightley was there too, was Mr.
Knightley?"
"No, Mr. Knightley; Mr. Knightley declined it from the first; and though I thought Mr. Knightley would come, because Mrs. Elton declared Mrs. Elton would not let Mr. Knightley off, Mr. Knightley did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and a very agreeable evening us had.
Such kind friends, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning's party.
Even pleasure, you know, is fatiguing--and I cannot say that any of Such kind friends, you know, Miss Woodhouse seemed very much to have enjoyed it.
However, _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it a very pleasant party."
"Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it a very pleasant party, had been making up "Miss Fairfax mind the whole day?"
"I dare say "Miss Fairfax had."
"Whenever the time may come, the time must be unwelcome to "Miss Fairfax and all "Miss Fairfax friends--but I hope "Miss Fairfax engagement will have every alleviation that is possible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family."
"Thank you, Miss Bates.
Yes, indeed, there is every thing in the world that can make "Miss Fairfax happy in it.
Except the Sucklings and Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance.
Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove--and as to the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere.
Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!-- It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.--And Jane salary!-- I really cannot venture to name Jane salary to you, Miss Woodhouse.
Even you, used as you are to great sums, would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane."
"Ah!
madam," cried Emma, "if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly earned."
"You are so noble in your ideas!"
"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?"
"Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it.
Within a fortnight.
a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior-- is in a great hurry.
My poor mother does not know how to bear it.
So then, I try to put it out of My poor mother thoughts, and say, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any more."
"My poor mother friends must all be sorry to lose My poor mother; and will not Colonel and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that My poor mother has engaged My poor mother before Her friends return?"
"Yes; Jane says Jane is sure Her friends will; but yet, this is such a situation as Jane cannot feel Jane justified in declining.
I was so astonished when Jane first told me what Jane had been saying to Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon the same moment!
the same moment was before tea--stay--no, the same moment could not be before tea, because we were just going to cards--and yet it was before tea, because I remember thinking--Oh!
no, now I recollect, now I have it; something happened before tea, but not that.
Mrs. Elton was called out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with Mrs. Elton.
Poor old John, I have a great regard for Mrs. Elton; Mrs. Elton was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, Mrs. Elton is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in Mrs. Elton joints-- I must go and see Mrs. Elton to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if Jane gets out at all.
And poor John's son came to talk to Mrs. Elton about relief from the parish; poor John's son is very well to do poor John's son, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing of that sort, but still poor John's son cannot keep poor John's son father without some help; and so, when Mrs. Elton came back, Mrs. Elton told us what John ostler had been telling John, and then John ostler came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond.
That was what happened before tea.
It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs.
Elton."
Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to Emma; but as without supposing it possible that Emma could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill's going, Emma proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.
What Mrs. Elton had learned from John ostler on the subject, being the accumulation of John ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Frank Churchill had sent Mr. Frank Churchill nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mr. Frank Churchill, and only wishing his nephew not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and Mr. Frank Churchill horse seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the chaise, and John ostler had stood out and seen John ostler pass by, his nephew going a good pace, and driving very steady.
There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and John ostler caught Emma's attention only as John ostler united with the subject which already engaged Emma mind.
The contrast between Mr. Frank Churchill's importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck Jane Fairfax; one was every thing, the other nothing--and Jane Fairfax sat musing on the difference of woman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what Jane Fairfax eyes were fixed, till roused by Miss Bates's saying, "Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte.
What is to become of that?--Very true.
Jane Jane was talking of it just now.-- 'You must go,' said Jane.
'You and I must part.
You will have no business here.--Let it stay, however,' said Jane; 'give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back.
I shall talk about it to Colonel Campbell; Colonel Campbell will settle for Jane; Colonel Campbell will help me out of all my difficulties.'
-- And to this day, I do believe, Jane knows not whether it was Colonel Campbell present or Colonel Campbell daughter's."
Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of all Emma former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing, that Emma soon allowed Emma to believe Emma visit had been long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that Emma could venture to say of the good wishes which Emma really felt, took leave.
