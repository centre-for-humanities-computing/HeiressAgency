The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. Mr. Frank Churchill came with Mrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury Mr. Frank Churchill seemed to take very cordially. Mr. Frank Churchill had been sitting with Mrs. Weston, it appeared, most companionably at home, till Mrs. Weston usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk, immediately fixed on Highbury.--"He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to Mr. Frank Churchill, Mr. Frank Churchill should always chuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury, would be Mr. Frank Churchill constant attraction."-- Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for Hartfield; and Mrs. Weston trusted to it bearing the same construction with Mr. Frank Churchill. They walked thither directly. Mrs. Weston had hardly expected They: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for half a minute, in order to hear that Mr. Frank Churchill son was very handsome, knew nothing of They plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to Mrs. Weston, therefore, to perceive They walking up to the house together, arm in arm. Mrs. Weston was wanting to see his son again, and especially to see his son in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his son behaviour to whom Mrs. Weston opinion of his son was to depend. If his son were deficient there, nothing should make amends for he were deficient there. But on seeing them together, Mrs. Weston became perfectly satisfied. It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that his son paid his son duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his son whole manner to Mrs. Weston--nothing could more agreeably denote his son wish of considering Mrs. Weston as a friend and securing Mrs. Weston affection. And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning. their were all three walking about together for an hour or two--first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved on, confessed He wish to be made acquainted with the whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed. Some of the objects of He curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He begged to be shewn the house which He father had lived in so long, and which had been the home of He father's father; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed He was still living, walked in quest of an old woman who had nursed him cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must be very like a merit to those He was with. Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it could not be fairly supposed that He had been ever voluntarily absenting He; that He had not been acting a part, or making a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done Mr. Knightley justice. Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it Their gave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. his was immediately interested. it character as a ball-room caught his; and instead of passing on, his stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate it capabilities, and lament that it original purpose should have ceased. his saw no fault in a ball-room, his would acknowledge none which they suggested. No, it was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. it would hold the very number for comfort. they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in Highbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. he could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around he, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their proper place the next morning. he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills. he seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of he father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; he indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind. he could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively spirits. At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma recollected he intended visit the day before, and asked he if he had paid it. "Yes, oh! yes"--he replied; "I was just going to mention it. A very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize, the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize must have been the death of me. As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before my father--but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found, when my father (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour. The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before." "And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?" "Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is the expression? Ladies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax Fairfax is naturally so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.-- A most deplorable want of complexion." Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax's complexion. "It was certainly never brilliant, but Emma would not allow It to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and delicacy in Emma skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of Emma face." He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that He had heard many people say the same--but yet He must confess, that to He nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health. Where features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where them all were good, the effect was--fortunately He need not attempt to describe what the effect was. "Well," said Emma, "there is no disputing about taste.--At least you admire Emma except Emma complexion." He shook He head and laughed.--"I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and Fairfax complexion." "Did you see Fairfax often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?" At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and Ford hastily exclaimed, "Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of they lives, as my father informs me. my father comes to Highbury himself, my father says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's. If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove my father to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury himself. I must buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.-- I dare say they sell gloves." "Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will be adored in Highbury himself. You were very popular before you came, because you were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at Ford's, and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues." They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of "Men's Beavers" and "York Tan" were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he said--"But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to my father, you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life." "I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and Fairfax party at Weymouth." "And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one. It is always The good lady's right to decide on the degree of acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given Miss Fairfax account.-- I shall not commit my father by claiming more than her account.-- may chuse to allow." "Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as her account.-- could do her account.--. But her account.-- account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, her account.-- is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any body, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her account.--." "May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so well. I met her account.-- frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set. Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Colonel Campbell a friendly, warm-hearted woman. I like them all." "You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what Miss Fairfax is destined to be?" "Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do." "You get upon delicate subjects, Emma," said Mrs. Weston smiling; "remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life. I will move a little farther off." "I certainly do forget to think of _Miss Fairfax_," said Emma, "as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend." Frank Churchill looked as if Frank Churchill fully understood and honoured such a sentiment. When the gloves were bought, and the gloves had quitted the shop again, "Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?" said Frank Churchill. "Ever hear Miss Fairfax!" repeated Emma. "You forget how much Miss Fairfax belongs to Highbury himself. I have heard Miss Fairfax every year of we lives since we both began. Miss Fairfax plays charmingly." "You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge. Miss Fairfax appeared to me to play well, that is, with considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.-- I am excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body's performance.--I have been used to hear Miss Fairfax's admired; and I remember one proof of Miss Fairfax being thought to play well:--a man, a very musical man, and in love with another woman--engaged to Miss Fairfax--on the point of marriage--would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down instead--never seemed to like to hear one if the lady in question could hear the other. That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof." "Proof indeed!" said Emma, highly amused.--"Mr. Dixon is very musical, is Dixon? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year." "Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Colonel Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a very strong proof." "Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger than, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable to me. I could not excuse a man's having more music than love--more ear than eye--a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings. How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?" "It was Miss Campbell very particular friend, you know." "Poor comfort!" said Emma, laughing. "One would rather have a stranger preferred than one's very particular friend--with a stranger it might not recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!-- Poor Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad does oneself!-- Poor Mrs. Dixon is gone to settle in Ireland." "You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but Miss Campbell really did not seem to feel it." "So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which. But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in Miss Campbell--quickness of friendship, or dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have felt it: Miss Fairfax. Miss Fairfax must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction." "As to that--I do not--" "Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's sensations from you, or from any body else. I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's sensations from you, or from any body else are known to no human being, I guess, but Miss Fairfax. But if Miss Fairfax continued to play whenever Miss Fairfax was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses." "There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--" he began rather quickly, but checking he, added, "however, it is impossible for me to say on what terms them really were--how it might all be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a better judge of Miss Fairfax character, and of how Miss Fairfax is likely to conduct Miss Fairfax in critical situations, than I can be." "I have known Miss Fairfax from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever Miss Fairfax visited Miss Fairfax friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as Miss Fairfax always was, by Miss Fairfax aunt and grandmother, and all her aunt and grandmother set. And then, Miss Fairfax reserve--I never could attach Miss Fairfax to any one so completely reserved." "It is a most repulsive quality, indeed," said he. "Oftentimes very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve, but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person." "Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think ill of her--not the least--except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal." He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and thinking so much alike, Emma felt Emma so well acquainted with He, that Emma could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He was not exactly what Emma had expected; less of the man of the world in some of He notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better than Emma had expected. He ideas seemed more moderate--He feelings warmer. Emma was particularly struck by He manner of considering Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as the church, He would go and look at, and would not join Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as the church, he would go and look in finding much fault with. No, He could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having. If it a bad house were to be shared with the woman He loved, He could not think any man to be pitied for having it a bad house. There must be ample room in it a bad house for every real comfort. a man must be a blockhead who wanted more. Mrs. Weston laughed, and said a man did not know what a man was talking about. Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, a man could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one. But Emma, in Emma own mind, determined that a man _did_ know what a man was talking about, and that a man shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives. a man might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or a bad butler's pantry, but no doubt a man did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make a man happy, and that whenever a man were attached, a man would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.
