Time passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would be arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of It one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve Emma, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After the first chat of pleasure Mr. Knightley was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began with, "I have something to tell you, Emma; some news." "Good or bad?" said Emma, quickly, looking up in Mr. Knightley face. "I do not know which it ought to be called." "Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance. You are trying not to smile." "I am afraid," said Mr. Knightley, composing Mr. Knightley features, "I am very much afraid, Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it." "Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too." "There is one subject," Mr. Knightley replied, "I hope but one, on which we do not think alike." Mr. Knightley paused a moment, again smiling, with Mr. Knightley eyes fixed on his face. "Does nothing occur to you?-- Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith." Emma cheeks flushed at the name, and Emma felt afraid of something, though Emma knew not what. "Have you heard from Emma yourself this morning?" cried Mr. Knightley. "You have, I believe, and know the whole." "No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me." "You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is. Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin." Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--and Emma eyes, in eager gaze, said, "No, this is impossible!" but Emma lips were closed. "It is so, indeed," continued Mr. Knightley; "I have It from Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin. Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin left me not half an hour ago." Emma was still looking at Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin with the most speaking amazement. "You like it, EmmaEmma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were the same. But in time our opinions will. Time, you may be sure, will make one or the other of our think differently; and, in the meanwhile, our need not talk much on the subject." "You mistake me, you quite mistake me," Emma replied, exerting Emma. "It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin. You cannot mean that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin has even proposed to Emma again--yet. You only mean, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin intends it." "I mean that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin has done it," answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but determined decision, "and been accepted." "Good God!" Emma cried.--"Well!"--Then having recourse to Emma workbasket, in excuse for leaning down Emma face, and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which Emma knew Emma must be expressing, Emma added, "Well, now tell me every thing; make this intelligible to Emma. How, where, when?--Let me know it all. I never was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.--How--how has it been possible?" "it is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago, and I got He to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John.--He delivered some papers which I was wanting to send to John.--He to John, at He chambers, and was asked by He to join some papers which I was wanting to send to John.--He party the same evening to Astley's. their party were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. their party was to be our brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could not resist. their party called for My friend Robert in their party way; were all extremely amused; and my brother asked My friend Robert to dine with their party the next day--which My friend Robert did--and in the course of that visit (as I understand) My friend Robert found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in vain.--She made My friend Robert, by Harriet acceptance, as happy even as My friend Robert is deserving. My friend Robert came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report My friend Robert proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on My friend Robert own. This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when. My friend Robert will make a much longer history when you see her.-- My friend Robert will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.--In our communications our deal only in the great.--However, I must say, that Robert Martin's heart seemed for _Robert Martin's_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that Robert Martin's did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John, and Robert Martin's followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one time Miss Smith and Henry were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy." Robert Martin's stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, He stopped.--Emma was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness. He stopped.--Emma must wait a moment, or He stopped.--Emma would think He stopped.--Emma mad. He stopped.--Emma silence disturbed He stopped.--Emma; and after observing He stopped.--Emma a little while, He stopped.--Emma added, "Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy; but I am afraid this circumstance gives you more pain than you expected. He stopped.--Emma situation is an evil--but you must consider His situation as what satisfies your friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of He stopped.--Emma as you know He stopped.--Emma more. He stopped.--Emma good sense and good principles would delight you.--As far as He stopped.--Emma is concerned, you could not wish your friend in better hands. He stopped.--Emma rank in society I would alter if I could, which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me about William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin." William Larkins wanted ill spare Robert Martin to look up and smile; and having now brought ill spare Robert Martin not to smile too broadly--ill spare Robert Martin did--cheerfully answering, "You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think Harriet is doing extremely well. _Harriet_ connexions may be worse than _his_. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe Harriet very lately more determined against He stopped.--Emma, much more, than Harriet was before." "You ought to know your friend best," replied Mr. Knightley; "but I should say Harriet was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told Harriet he loved Harriet." Harriet could not help laughing as Harriet answered, "Upon my word, I believe you know Harriet quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley, are you perfectly sure that Harriet has absolutely and downright _accepted_ Mr. Knightley. I could suppose Harriet might in time--but can Harriet already?-- Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things; of business, shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you, in the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not Harriet's hand that mistake him?--It was certain of--it was the dimensions of some famous ox." The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley was, at this moment, so strong to Harriet's feelings, and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet's side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis, "No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin," that Harriet was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature. It could not be otherwise. "Do you dare say this?" cried Mr. Knightley. "Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?-- What do you deserve?" "Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?" "I am quite sure," Mr. Martin and Harriet replied, speaking very distinctly, "that Mr. Martin and Harriet told me Harriet had accepted Mr. Martin and Harriet; and that there was no obscurity, nothing doubtful, in the words Mr. Martin and Harriet used; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so. Mr. Martin and Harriet asked my opinion as to what Mr. Martin and Harriet was now to do. Mr. Martin and Harriet knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom Mr. Martin and Harriet could apply for information of Mrs. Goddard relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured Mr. Martin and Harriet that I could not. Then, Mr. Martin and Harriet said, Mr. Martin and Harriet would endeavour to see Mrs. Goddard in the course of this day." "I am perfectly satisfied," replied Emma, with the brightest smiles, "and most sincerely wish the brightest smiles happy." "You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before." "I hope so--for at that time I was a fool." "And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet's good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and for Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with Mrs. Goddard as ever,) to get acquainted with Mrs. Goddard. I have often talked to Mrs. Goddard a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Robert Martin's's cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations, I am convinced of Mrs. Goddard being an artless, amiable girl, with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing Mrs. Goddard happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.-- Much of this, I have no doubt, Mrs. Goddard may thank you for." "Me!" cried Emma, shaking Mrs. Goddard head.--"Ah! HarrietHarriet!" Mrs. Goddard checked Mrs. Goddard, however, and submitted quietly to a little more praise than Mrs. Goddard deserved. Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of Mrs. Goddard father. Mrs. Goddard was not sorry. Mrs. Goddard wanted to be alone. Mrs. Goddard mind was in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for Mrs. Goddard to be collected. Mrs. Goddard was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till Mrs. Goddard had moved about, and talked to Mrs. Goddard, and laughed and reflected, Mrs. Goddard could be fit for nothing rational. her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put the horses to, preparatory to the horses now daily drive to Randalls; and Mrs. Goddard had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing. The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of Mrs. Goddard sensations may be imagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet's welfare, Mrs. Goddard was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.--What had Mrs. Goddard to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to Mrs. Goddard own. Nothing, but that the lessons of Mrs. Goddard past folly might teach Mrs. Goddard humility and circumspection in future. Serious Mrs. Goddard was, very serious in Mrs. Goddard thankfulness, and in Mrs. Goddard resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst of them. Mrs. Goddard must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart--such a Harriet! Now there would be pleasure in Mrs. Goddard returning--Every thing would be a pleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin. High in the rank of Mrs. Goddard most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would soon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to Mrs. Goddard to practise, might soon be over. Mrs. Goddard could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which Mrs. Goddard disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty. In the gayest and happiest spirits Mrs. Goddard set forward with her father; not always listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of he being obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed. They arrived.--Mrs. poor Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--but hardly had They been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for coming, which Mr. Woodhouse asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window. "It is Frank and Miss Fairfax," said poor Mrs. Weston. "I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing Mr. Woodhouse arrive this morning. Mr. Woodhouse stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with Miss Fairfax are coming in, I hope." In half a minute They were in the room. Harriet was extremely glad to see Mr. Woodhouse--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of embarrassing recollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that Harriet began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which Harriet had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing Mr. Woodhouse with Jane, would yield the wish proportion of pleasure. When poor Mrs. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation--or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near the baby and say, "I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message in one of poor Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said." "No, indeed," cried Harriet, most happy to begin, "not in the least. I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give you joy in person." Mr. Woodhouse thanked Harriet with all Mr. Woodhouse heart, and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of Mr. Woodhouse gratitude and happiness. "Is not Harriet looking well?" said Mr. Woodhouse, turning Mr. Woodhouse eyes towards Jane. "Better than Jane ever used to do?--You see how my father and poor Mrs. Weston doat upon Jane." But Mr. Woodhouse spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, Mr. Woodhouse named the name of Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in Jane hearing. "I can never think of it," Jane cried, "without extreme shame." "The shame," Mr. Woodhouse answered, "is all mine, or ought to be. But is it possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late. Early, I know, you had none." "I never had the smallest, I assure you." "That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near--and I wish I had--it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong things, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.-- It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing." "It is not now worth a regret," said Harriet. "I have some hope," resumed he, "of my uncle's being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to Harriet. When the Campbells are returned, we shall meet the Campbells in London, and continue there, I trust, till the Campbells may carry Harriet northward.--But now, I am at such a distance from Harriet--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?-- Till this morning, the Campbells have not once met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?" Harriet spoke Harriet pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay thought, he cried, "Ah! by the bye," then sinking he voice, and looking demure for the moment--"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?" Mr. Knightley paused.--She coloured and laughed.--"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish in your favour. Let me return your congratulations.-- I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise." Harriet was delighted, and only wanted Mr. Knightley to go on in the same style; but Mr. Knightley mind was the next moment in Mr. Knightley own concerns and with Mr. Knightley own Jane, and Mr. Knightley next words were, "Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--and yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call Harriet fair. It is a most uncommon complexion, with Harriet dark eye-lashes and hair--a most distinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.-- Just colour enough for beauty." "I have always admired Harriet complexion," replied Harriet, archly; "but do not I remember the time when you found fault with Harriet for being so pale?-- When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?" "Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--" But I was!--How laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Harriet could not help saying, "I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you had very great amusement in tricking we all.--I am sure you had.-- I am sure it was a consolation to you." "Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most miserable wretch!" "Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking we in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the truth, I think the truth might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation. I think there is a little likeness between we." a little likeness between us bowed. "If not in our dispositions," she presently added, with a look of true sensibility, "there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which bids fair to connect our with two characters so much superior to our own." "True, true," a little likeness between us answered, warmly. "No, not true on your side. You can have no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel. Look at she. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of she throat. Observe she eyes, as she is looking up at my father.-- You will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that my uncle means to give she all my aunt's jewels. They are to be new set. I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be beautiful in she dark hair?" "Very beautiful, indeed," replied Harriet; and Harriet spoke so kindly, that he gratefully burst out, "How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come." The others had been talking of the child, poor Mrs. Weston giving an account of a little alarm poor Mrs. Weston had been under, the evening before, from the infant's appearing not quite well. poor Mrs. Weston believed poor Mrs. Weston had been foolish, but the infant's appearing had alarmed poor Mrs. Weston, and poor Mrs. Weston had been within half a minute of sending for Mr. Perry. Perhaps poor Mrs. Weston ought to be ashamed, but poor Mrs. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes, however, the child had been perfectly well again. This was poor Mrs. Weston history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended poor Mrs. Weston very much for thinking of sending for Mr. Perry, and only regretted that poor Mrs. Weston had not done it. "poor Mrs. Weston should always send for Mr. Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were the child only for a moment. poor Mrs. Weston could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Mr. Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now, very well considering, the child would probably have been better if Mr. Perry had seen it." Frank Churchill caught the name. "Perry!" said Frank Churchill to Harriet, and trying, as Frank Churchill spoke, to catch Miss Fairfax's eye. "My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr. Perry?--Has Mr. been here this morning?--And how does Mr. travel now?--Has Mr. set up Mr. carriage?" Harriet soon recollected, and understood Mr.; and while Harriet joined in the laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that Harriet too was really hearing Mr., though trying to seem deaf. "Such an extraordinary dream of mine!" he cried. "I can never think of it without laughing.--She hears us, Harriet hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see it in Harriet cheek, Harriet smile, Harriet vain attempt to frown. Look at Harriet. Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of Harriet own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under Harriet eye--that the whole blunder is spread before Harriet--that Harriet can attend to nothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?" Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly remained as Jane turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet steady voice, "How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!-- They _will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!" him had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but Harriet's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, Jane felt, that pleased as Jane had been to see Frank Churchill, and really regarding Frank Churchill as Jane did with friendship, Jane had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character. The happiness of this most happy day, received The happiness of this most happy day completion, in the animated contemplation of him worth which this comparison produced.
