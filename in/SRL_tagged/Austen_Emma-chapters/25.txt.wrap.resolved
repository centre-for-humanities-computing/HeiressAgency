Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day, by hearing that Frank Churchill was gone off to London, merely to have Frank Churchill hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized Frank Churchill at breakfast, and Frank Churchill had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut. There was certainly no harm in Frank Churchill travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. it did not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed she to discern in Frank Churchill yesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of Frank Churchill father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how Frank Churchill conduct might appear in general; Frank Churchill became liable to all these charges. Frank Churchill father only called Frank Churchill a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by Mrs. Weston passing it over as quickly as possible, and making no other comment than that "all young people would have all young people little whims." With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit hitherto had given Emma friend only good ideas of his. Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion his made his--how much Emma saw to like in his disposition altogether. his appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful and lively one; Emma could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great deal decidedly right; his spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond of talking of his--said his would be the best man in the world if his were left to his; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, his acknowledged Emma kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to speak of Emma with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote his unworthy of the distinguished honour which Emma imagination had given his; the honour, if not of being really in love with Emma, of being at least very near it, and saved only by Emma own indifference--(for still Emma resolution held of never marrying)--the honour, in short, of being marked out for Emma by all their joint acquaintance. Mr. Weston, on Mr. Weston side, added a virtue to the account which must have some weight. Mr. Weston gave Emma to understand that Frank admired Emma extremely--thought Emma very beautiful and very charming; and with so much to be said for Frank altogether, Emma found Emma must not judge Frank harshly. As Mr. Weston observed, "all young people would have "all young people little whims." There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so leniently disposed. In general his was judged, throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among liberal allowances not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr. Knightley. The circumstance was told his at Hartfield; for the moment, his was silent; but Emma heard his almost immediately afterwards say to his, over a newspaper his held in his hand, "Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I took his for." Emma had half a mind to resent; but an instant's observation convinced Emma that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore Emma let it pass. Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune. Something occurred while Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning were at Hartfield, to make Emma want Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning advice; and, which was still more lucky, Emma wanted exactly the advice Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning gave. This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, and unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade, and only moderately genteel. On they first coming into the country, they had lived in proportion to they income, quietly, keeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had brought they a considerable increase of means--the house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on they. With they wealth, they views increased; they want of a larger house, they inclination for more company. they added to the house in town, to they number of servants, to they expenses of every sort; and by this time were, in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield. they love of society, and they new dining-room, prepared every body for they keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the single men, had already taken place. The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose The regular and best families would presume to invite-- neither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go, if The regular and best families did; and her regretted that her father's known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than her could wish. The Coles were very respectable in The Coles way, but The Coles ought to be taught that it was not for The Coles to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit The Coles. This lesson, her very much feared, The Coles would receive only from her; her had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston. But her had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before this presumption appeared, that when the insult came at last, the insult found her very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received Donwell and Randalls invitation, and none had come for her father and her; and Mrs. Weston's accounting for it with "I suppose Donwell and Randalls will not take the liberty with you; Donwell and Randalls know you do not dine out," was not quite sufficient. her felt that her should like to have had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her, occurred again and again, her did not know that her might not have been tempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses. They had been speaking of it as They walked about Highbury the day before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented Harriet absence. Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of Frank Churchill. The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort. It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first remark, on reading it, was that "of course it must be declined," her so very soon proceeded to ask their what their advised her to do, that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful. her owned that, considering every thing, her was not absolutely without inclination for the party. The Coles expressed The Coles so properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--so much consideration for her father. "The Coles would have solicited the honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from London, which The Coles hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air, and therefore induce Mr. Woodhouse the more readily to give The Coles the honour of Mr. Woodhouse company." Upon the whole, her was very persuadable; and the whole being briefly settled among themselves how the whole might be done without neglecting his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing his company-- Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of Mr. Woodhouse daughter's going out to dinner on a day now near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from Mr. Woodhouse. As for _Mr. Woodhouse_ going, Emma did not wish Mr. Woodhouse to think it possible, the hours would be too late, and the party too numerous. Mr. Woodhouse was soon pretty well resigned. "I am not fond of dinner-visiting," said he--"I never was. No more is Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it. I think it would be much better if Mr. and Mrs. Cole would come in one afternoon next summer, and take Mr. and Mrs. Cole tea with us--take us in Mr. and Mrs. Cole afternoon walk; which Mr. and Mrs. Cole might do, as us hours are so reasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with they, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of Emma, I cannot wish to prevent care, provided the weather be what care ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy." Then turning to Mrs. Weston, with a look of gentle reproach--"Ah! Emma, if you had not married, you would have staid at home with me." "Well, sir," cried Mr. Weston, "as I took Emma Emma away, it is incumbent on me to supply Emma place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it." But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing, not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better how to allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately arranged. With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual. "Mr. Woodhouse should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. Mr. Woodhouse had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite Emma. James could take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole." "You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_, of course. But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to be done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with James. We have never been there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get there, you must tell James at what time you would have James come for you again; and you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying late. You will get very tired when tea is over." "But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?" "Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many people talking at once. You will not like the noise." "But, my dear sir," cried Mr. Weston, "if Emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party." "And no great harm if it does," said Mr. Woodhouse. "The sooner every party breaks up, the better." "But you do not consider how it may appear to The Coles. Emma's going away directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured people, and think little of They own claims; but still They must feel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment; and Mr. Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any other person's in the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify The Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years." "No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain. I know what worthy people them are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor. You would not think Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor to look at Mr. Cole, but Mr. Cole is bilious--Mr. Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means of giving them any pain. Emma, we must consider this. I am sure, rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends." "Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for Emma; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am only afraid of your sitting up for Emma. I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. Mrs. Goddard loves piquet, you know; but when Mrs. Goddard is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by you, instead of going to bed at your usual time--and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit up." He did, on the condition of some promises on Mrs. Goddard side: such as that, if Mrs. Goddard came home cold, Mrs. Goddard would be sure to warm Mrs. Goddard thoroughly; if hungry, that Mrs. Goddard would take something to eat; that Mrs. Goddard own maid should sit up for Mrs. Goddard; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house, as usual.
