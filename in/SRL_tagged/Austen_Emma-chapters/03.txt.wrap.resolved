Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in Mr. Woodhouse own way. Mr. Woodhouse liked very much to have Mr. Woodhouse friends come and see Mr. Woodhouse; and from various united causes, from Mr. Woodhouse long residence at Hartfield, and Mr. Woodhouse good nature, from Mr. Woodhouse fortune, Mr. Woodhouse house, and Mr. Woodhouse daughter, Mr. Woodhouse could command the visits of Mr. Woodhouse own little circle, in a great measure, as Mr. Woodhouse liked. Mr. Woodhouse had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle; Mr. Woodhouse horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made Mr. Woodhouse unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit Mr. Woodhouse on Mr. Woodhouse own terms. Fortunately for Mr. Woodhouse, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such. Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, Mr. Woodhouse had some of the chosen and the best to dine with Mr. Woodhouse: but evening parties were what Mr. Woodhouse preferred; and, unless Mr. Woodhouse fancied Mr. Woodhouse at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card-table for Mr. Woodhouse. Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of Mr. Woodhouse own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles of Mr. Woodhouse lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away. After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance. Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. a very old lady lived with a very old lady single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward circumstances, can excite. her single daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married. Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour; and Miss Bates had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to Miss Bates, or frighten those who might hate Miss Bates into outward respect. Miss Bates had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Miss Bates youth had passed without distinction, and Miss Bates middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible. And yet Miss Bates was a happy woman, and a woman whom no one named without good-will. It was Miss Bates own universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. Miss Bates loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's merits; thought Miss Bates a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity and cheerfulness of Miss Bates nature, Miss Bates contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to Miss Bates. Miss Bates was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless gossip. Miss Bates was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble girls into a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Miss Bates's school was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: Mrs. Goddard's school had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let the children run about a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed the children chilblains with Mrs. Goddard's school own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after Mrs. Goddard's school to church. Mrs. Goddard's school was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who had worked hard in Mrs. Goddard's school youth, and now thought Mrs. Goddard's school entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt Mr. Woodhouse particular claim on Mrs. Goddard's school to leave Mrs. Goddard's school neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever Mrs. Goddard's school could, and win or lose a few sixpences by Mr. Woodhouse fireside. These were the ladies whom Emma found Emma very frequently able to collect; and happy was Emma, for Emma father's sake, in the power; though, as far as Emma was Emma concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston. Emma was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with Emma for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made Emma feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings Emma had fearfully anticipated. As Emma sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with Emma; a most welcome request: for Miss Smith Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of Emma beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion. Miss Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed Miss Smith, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebody had lately raised Miss Smith from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of Miss Smith history. Miss Smith had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with Miss Smith. Miss Smith was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired. Miss Smith was short, plump, and fair, with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased with Emma manners as Emma person, and quite determined to continue the acquaintance. Emma was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss SmithMiss Smith's conversation, but Emma found Emma altogether very engaging--not inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing, shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what Emma had been used to, that Emma must have good sense, and deserve encouragement. Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions. The acquaintance Emma had already formed were unworthy of Emma. The friends from whom Emma had just parted, though very good sort of people, must be doing Emma harm. The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort of people, must be doing her harm were a family of the name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very creditably, Emma believed--Emma knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort of people, must be doing her harm--but The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort of people, must be doing her harm must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect. _She_ would notice Emma; Emma would improve Emma; Emma would detach Emma from Emma bad acquaintance, and introduce Emma into good society; Emma would form Emma opinions and Emma manners. It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming Emma own situation in life, Emma leisure, and powers. Emma was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which always closed such parties, and for which Emma had been used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the fire, before Emma was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas, did Emma then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which Emma knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests. Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare. He loved to have the cloth laid, because the cloth had been the fashion of He youth, but He conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made He rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while He hospitality would have welcomed He visitors to every thing, He care for their health made He grieve that their would eat. Such another small basin of thin gruel as He own was all that He could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though He might constrain He, while some young ladies who had been at school there with her were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to say: "Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else; but you need not be afraid, an egg boiled by any body else are very small, you see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart--a _very_ little bit. our are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the custard. Miss Bates, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine? A _small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree with Miss Bates." Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied Emma visitors in a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending her visitors away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith Miss Smith was quite equal to Miss Smith intentions. Miss Bates was so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which Miss Bates had treated Miss Bates all the evening, and actually shaken hands with Miss Bates at last!
