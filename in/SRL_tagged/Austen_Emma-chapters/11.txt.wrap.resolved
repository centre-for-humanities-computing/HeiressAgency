Mr. Elton must now be left to Mr. Elton. It was no longer in Emma's power to superintend Mr. Elton happiness or quicken Mr. Elton measures. The coming of Emma sister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth Emma prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected--Emma did not Emma expect--that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be afforded by Emma to the lovers. their might advance rapidly if their would, however; their must advance somehow or other whether their would or no. Emma hardly wished to have more leisure for their. There are people, who the more you do for their, the less their will do for their. Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest. Till this year, every long vacation since Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was therefore many months since Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley had been seen in a regular way by Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit. even for poor Isabella's sake thought much of the evils of the journey for Emma, and not a little of the fatigues of even for poor Isabella's sake own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way; but even for poor Isabella's sake alarms were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which even for poor Isabella's sake nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing, which the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to even for poor Isabella's sake, either in the children or in any restless attendance on the children. Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt up in Mrs. John Knightley family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly attached to Mrs. John Knightley father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. Mrs. John Knightley could never see a fault in any of these higher ties. Mrs. John Knightley was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance of Mrs. John Knightley father, Mrs. John Knightley inherited also much of her father constitution; was delicate in Mrs. John Knightley own health, over-careful of that of Mrs. John Knightley children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of Mrs. John Knightley own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance. Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man; rising in Mr. John Knightley profession, domestic, and respectable in Mr. John Knightley private character; but with reserved manners which prevented Mr. John Knightley being generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. Mr. John Knightley was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but Mr. John Knightley temper was not Mr. John Knightley great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased. The extreme sweetness of his temper must hurt Mr. John Knightley. Mr. John Knightley had all the clearness and quickness of mind which her wanted, and Mr. John Knightley could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing. Mr. John Knightley was not a great favourite with Mr. John Knightley fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong in Mr. John Knightley escaped her. her was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt her. Perhaps her might have passed over more had Mr. John Knightley manners been flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which Mr. John Knightley sometimes fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father. There Mr. John Knightley had not always the patience that could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking Mr. John Knightley to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great regard for Mr. John Knightley father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was due to Mr. John Knightley; but it was too often for Emma's charity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality. none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity so short had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called Mr. Woodhouse daughter's attention to the sad change at Hartfield since his daughter had been there last. "Ah, my dear," said Mr. Woodhouse, "poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business." "Oh yes, sir," cried his daughter with ready sympathy, "how you must miss his daughter! And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--I have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope his daughter is pretty well, sir." "Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know but that the place agrees with his daughter tolerably." Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls. "Oh! no--none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life--never looking so well. Mr. John Knightley here is only speaking Mr. John Knightley here own regret." "Very much to the honour of both," was the handsome reply. "And do you see Mrs. Weston, sir, tolerably often?" asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited Isabella father. Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish." "Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since them married. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both, either at Randalls or here--and as you may suppose, Isabella, most frequently here. Isabella, most frequently here are very, very kind in Isabella, most frequently here visits. Mrs. Weston is really as kind as Mrs. Weston. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing Miss Taylor by any means to the extent our ourselves anticipated--which is the exact truth." "Just as it should be," said Mr. John Knightley, "and just as I hoped it was from your letters. Miss Taylor wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted, and shewing you attention being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied." "Why, to be sure," said Mr. Woodhouse--"yes, certainly--I cannot deny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often-- but then--Emma is always obliged to go away again." "It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if Mr. Weston did not, papa.-- You quite forget poor Mr. Weston." "I think, indeed," said Mr. John Knightley pleasantly, "that poor Mr. Weston has some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for Isabella, Isabella has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as Isabella can." "Me, my love," cried the man wife, hearing and understanding only in part.-- "Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for the misery of Isabella leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know he equal for temper. I shall never forget he flying Henry's kite for he that very windy day last Easter--and ever since he particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night, on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve a better man in existence.--If, it must be Miss TaylorMiss Taylor." "Where is a better man in existence.--If?" said Mr. John Knightley. "Has a better man in existence.--If been here on this occasion--or has a better man in existence.--If not?" "a better man in existence.--If has not been here yet," replied Emma. "There was a strong expectation of a better man in existence.--If coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in nothing; and I have not heard a better man in existence.--If mentioned lately." "But you should tell them of the letter, my dear," said Emma . "a better man in existence.--If wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate poor Mrs. Weston, and a very proper, handsome letter it was. poor Mrs. Weston shewed it to a better man in existence.--If. I thought it very well done of a better man in existence.--If indeed. Whether it was a better man in existence.--If own idea you know, one cannot tell. a better man in existence.--If is but young, and a better man in existence.--If uncle, perhaps--" "My dear papa, a better man in existence.--If is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes." "Three-and-twenty!--is a better man in existence.--If indeed?--Well, I could not have thought it-- and a better man in existence.--If was but two years old when a better man in existence.--If lost a better man in existence.--If poor mother! Well, time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept. 28th--and began, 'My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on; and it was signed 'F. C. Weston Churchill.'-- I remember that perfectly." "How very pleasing and proper of a better man in existence.--If!" cried Mr. John Knightley. "I have no doubt of a better man in existence.--If being a most amiable young man. But how sad it is that a better man in existence.--If should not live at home with a better man in existence.--If ! There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from a better man in existence.--If parents and natural home! I never could comprehend how Mrs. Weston could part with Mrs. Weston. To give up one's child! I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else." "Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy," observed Mr. John Knightley coolly. "But you need not imagine Mrs. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mrs. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; Mrs. Weston takes things as Mrs. Weston finds things, and makes enjoyment of things somehow or other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for Mrs. Weston comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with Mrs. Weston neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any thing that home affords." Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mrs. Weston, and had half a mind to take it up; but Emma struggled, and let it pass. Emma would keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted Emma brother's disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance.
