Frank Churchill came back again; and if Frank Churchill kept Frank Churchill father's dinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious for Frank Churchill being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any imperfection which could be concealed.
Frank Churchill came back, had had Frank Churchill hair cut, and laughed at Frank Churchill with a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what Frank Churchill had done.
Frank Churchill had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve Frank Churchill spirits.
Frank Churchill was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing Frank Churchill, Emma thus moralised to herself:-- "I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way.
Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it.
Mr. Knightley, Mr. Knightley is _not_ a trifling, silly young man.
If Mr. Knightley were, Mr. Knightley would have done this differently.
Mr. Knightley would either have gloried in the achievement, or been ashamed of the achievement.
There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend the achievement own vanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that Mr. Knightley is not trifling or silly."
With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing Mr. Knightley again, and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of Mr. Knightley general manners, and by inference, of the meaning of Mr. Knightley manners towards his manners; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for his manners to throw coldness into his manners air; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were now seeing all those together for the first time.
his manners meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr. Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr. Elton, even in the days of Mr. Cole favour, none had disturbed his manners more than Mr. Cole propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.
his manners father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs. Goddard being able to come; and his manners last pleasing duty, before his manners left the house, was to pay his manners respects to her respects as her respects sat together after dinner; and while Her father was fondly noticing the beauty of his manners dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in his manners power, by helping her respects to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial Her father care of her respects constitution might have obliged her respects to practise during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner for her respects; his manners wished his manners could know that her respects had been allowed to eat it.
his manners followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased to see that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses, having little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and independence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as Mr. Knightley could, and not use Mr. Knightley carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.
his manners had an opportunity now of speaking his manners approbation while warm from his manners heart, for Mr. Knightley stopped to hand his manners out.
"This is coming as you should do," said his manners; "like a gentleman.-- I am quite glad to see you."
Mr. Knightley thanked his manners, observing, "How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment!
for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.-- You might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner."
"Yes I should, I am sure I should.
There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which people know to be beneath people.
You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances.
_Now_ you have nothing to try for.
You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed.
You are not striving to look taller than any body else.
_Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you."
"Nonsensical girl!"
was his reply, but not at all in anger.
Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr. Knightley.
Emma was received with a cordial respect which could not but please, and given all the consequence Emma could wish for.
When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of admiration were for Emma, from both husband and wife; the son approached Emma with a cheerful eagerness which marked Emma as the son peculiar object, and at dinner Emma found the son seated by Emma--and, as Emma firmly believed, not without some dexterity on the son side.
the party was rather large, as the party included one other family, a proper unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family, the lawyer of Highbury.
The less worthy females were to come in the evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already, at dinner, The less worthy females were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all Emma attention to the pleasantness of Emma neighbour.
The first remote sound to which Emma felt Emma obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax.
Emma seemed to be relating something of Emma that was expected to be very interesting.
Emma listened, and found it well worth listening to.
That very dear part of Emma, Emma fancy, received an amusing supply.
Emma was telling that Emma had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as Emma entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking instrument--not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on Emma side, and explanations on Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece--entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account, Emma was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered this pianoforte--but now, they were both perfectly satisfied that this pianoforte could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell.
"One can suppose nothing else," added Emma, "and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt.
But Emma, it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about a letter from them.
Emma knows them ways best; but I should not consider them silence as any reason for them not meaning to make the present.
them might chuse to surprize Emma."
Emma had many to agree with Emma; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that the subject must come from Colonel Campbell, and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think Emma own way, and still listen to Emma.
"I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument.
It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away.
This is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure!
and it was but yesterday I was telling Emma, I really was ashamed to look at ourselves new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and ourselves little girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world, to amuse Emma with.--I was saying this to Emma but yesterday, and Emma quite agreed with Emma; only Emma is so particularly fond of music that Emma could not help indulging Emma in the purchase, hoping that some of ourselves good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than ourselves can; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought--or else I am sure ourselves ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try the instrument this evening."
Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Emma's, turned to Frank Churchill.
"Why do you smile?"
said Miss Woodhouse.
"Nay, why do you?"
"Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present."
"Very."
"I rather wonder that it was never made before."
"Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before."
"Or that Frank Churchill did not give Miss Fairfax the use of their own instrument--which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body."
"That is a grand pianoforte, and Frank Churchill might think it too large for Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs. Goddard's house."
"You may _say_ what you chuse--but your countenance testifies that your _thoughts_ on the subject are very much like the subject."
"I do not know.
I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve.
I smile because you smile, and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what there is to question.
If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can be?"
"What do you say to Mrs.
Dixon?"
"Mrs. Dixon!
very true indeed.
I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon.
Mrs. Dixon must know as well as Mrs. Dixon , how acceptable an instrument would be; and perhaps the mode of an instrument, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young woman's scheme than an elderly man's.
It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say.
I told you that your suspicions would guide mine."
"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_.
Dixon in so."
"Mr.
Dixon.--Very well.
Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.
We were speaking the other day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of Mrs. Dixon performance."
"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either that, after making his proposals to Mrs. Dixon friend, his had the misfortune to fall in love with _Mrs.
Dixon_, or that his became conscious of a little attachment on Mrs. Dixon side.
One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for Mrs. Dixon chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland.
Here, Mrs. Dixon must be leading a life of privation and penance; there it would have been all enjoyment.
As to the pretence of trying Mrs. Dixon native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer excuse.--In might have passed; but what can any body's native air do for trying her native air in the months of January, February, and March?
Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare say in Mrs. Dixon's.
I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what all my suspicions are."
"And, upon my word, all my suspicions have an air of great probability.
Mrs. Dixon's preference of Mrs. Dixon music to Mrs. Dixon friend's, I can answer for being very decided."
"And then, Mrs. Dixon saved Mrs. Dixon life.
Did you ever hear of that?-- A water party; and by some accident Mrs. Dixon was falling overboard.
Mrs. Dixon caught Mrs.
Dixon."
"Mrs. Dixon did.
I was there--one of the party."
"Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course, for it seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think I should have made some discoveries."
"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mrs. Dixon caught her.--It was the work of a moment.
And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again--yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable.
I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made discoveries."
The conversation was here interrupted.
They were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma said, "The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with Emma.
I wanted to know a little more, and this tells me quite enough.
Depend upon it, we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs.
Dixon."
"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of the Dixons us must conclude the Dixons to come from the Campbells."
"No, I am sure the Dixons is not from the Campbells.
Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells, or the Campbells would have been guessed at first.
Miss Fairfax would not have been puzzled, had Miss Fairfax dared fix on the Campbells.
I may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced Miss Fairfax that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business."
"Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced.
Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely.
At first, while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw Colonel Campbell was the giver only as paternal kindness, and thought Colonel Campbell was the giver the most natural thing in the world.
But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that Colonel Campbell was the giver should be the tribute of warm female friendship.
And now I can see Colonel Campbell was the giver in no other light than as an offering of love."
There was no occasion to press the matter farther.
The conviction seemed real; The conviction looked as if The conviction felt The conviction.
Miss Fairfax said no more, other subjects took other subjects turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few downright silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other--nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes.
The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before The ladies, in The ladies different divisions, arrived.
Emma watched the entree of Emma own particular little friend; and if Emma could not exult in Emma dignity and grace, Emma could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed Emma so many alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection.
There Emma sat--and who would have guessed how many tears Emma had been lately shedding?
To be in company, nicely dressed Emma and seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour.
Miss Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected Miss Fairfax might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved--yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain--by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing Miss Fairfax beloved by the husband of Miss Fairfax friend.
In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach Emma.
Emma did not wish to speak of this pianoforte, Emma felt too much in the secret Emma, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the subject was almost immediately introduced, and Emma saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of "my excellent friend Colonel Campbell."
Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at Emma perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which Emma plainly read in the fair heroine's countenance.
They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill.
In Frank Churchill walked, the first and the handsomest; and after paying Frank Churchill compliments en passant to Miss Bates and Bates niece, made Frank Churchill way directly to the opposite side of the circle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till Frank Churchill could find a seat by Emma, would not sit at all.
Emma divined what every body present must be thinking.
Emma was his object, and every body must perceive his object.
Emma introduced his to Emma friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other.
"his had never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with Emma naivete."
And Emma, "Only to be sure it was paying his too great a compliment, but Emma did think there were some looks a little like Mr.
Elton."
Emma restrained Emma indignation, and only turned from Emma in silence.
Smiles of intelligence passed between Emma and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.
his told Emma that his had been impatient to leave the dining-room--hated sitting long--was always the first to move when his could--that his father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over parish business--that as long as his had staid, however, it had been pleasant enough, as his had found his father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole in general a set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether--thought it so abundant in agreeable families--that Emma began to feel Emma had been used to despise the place rather too much.
Emma questioned his as to the society in Yorkshire--the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his answers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little going on, that him as to the society in Yorkshire--the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort visitings were among a range of great families, none very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even chance that Frank Churchill were not in health and spirits for going; that him as to the society in Yorkshire--the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, though Frank Churchill had Frank Churchill separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, without considerable address _at_ _times_, that Frank Churchill could get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.
Emma saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at Enscombe best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than Frank Churchill liked.
Frank Churchill importance at Enscombe was very evident.
Frank Churchill did not boast, but His importance at Enscombe naturally betrayed His importance at Enscombe, that Frank Churchill had persuaded Frank Churchill aunt where Frank Churchill uncle could do nothing, and on Emma laughing and noticing it, Frank Churchill owned that Frank Churchill believed (excepting one or two points) Frank Churchill could _with_ _time_ persuade Emma to any thing.
One of those points on which Frank Churchill influence failed, Frank Churchill then mentioned.
Frank Churchill had wanted very much to go abroad--had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel--but Emma would not hear of it.
This had happened the year before.
_Now_, Frank Churchill said, Frank Churchill was beginning to have no longer the same wish.
The unpersuadable point, which Frank Churchill did not mention, Emma guessed to be good behaviour to Frank Churchill father.
"I have made a most wretched discovery," said Frank Churchill, after a short pause.-- "I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time.
I never knew days fly so fast.
A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy Frank Churchill.
But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!-- I hate the recollection."
"Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out of so few, in having your hair cut."
"No," said Frank Churchill, smiling, "that is no subject of regret at all.
I have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe Frank Churchill fit to be seen."
The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found Emma obliged to turn from Emma for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.
When Mr. Cole had moved away, and Emma attention could be restored as before, Emma saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.
"What is the matter?"
said Emma.
Frank Churchill started.
"Thank you for rousing me," Frank Churchill replied.
"I believe I have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax Fairfax has done Miss Fairfax hair in so odd a way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes from Miss Fairfax.
I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of curls!--This own.
I see nobody else looking like her!-- I must go and ask curls!--This whether it is an Irish fashion.
Shall I?-- Yes, I will--I declare I will--and you shall see how curls!--This takes it;--whether curls!--This colours."
Frank Churchill was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw Frank Churchill standing before Miss Fairfax, and talking to Emma; but as to its effect on the young lady, as Frank Churchill had improvidently placed Frank Churchill exactly between them, exactly in front of Miss Fairfax, Emma could absolutely distinguish nothing.
Before Frank Churchill could return to Frank Churchill chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.
"This is the luxury of a large party," said she:--"one can get near every body, and say every thing.
Emma, I am longing to talk to Emma.
I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like Emma, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh.
Do you know how Miss Bates and Miss Bates niece came here?"
"How?--They were invited, were not Miss Bates and her niece?"
"Oh!
yes--but how Miss Bates and her niece were conveyed hither?--the manner of Miss Bates and her niece coming?"
"Miss Bates and her niece walked, I conclude.
How else could Miss Bates and her niece come?"
"Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Miss Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and cold as the nights are now.
And as I looked at Miss Fairfax, though I never saw Miss Fairfax appear to more advantage, it struck me that Miss Fairfax was heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold.
Poor girl!
I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mrs. Weston came into the room, and I could get at Mrs. Weston, I spoke to Mrs. Weston about the carriage.
You may guess how readily Mrs. Weston came into my wishes; and having Mrs. Weston approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure Miss Bates that the carriage would be at Miss Bates service before the carriage took us home; for I thought it would be making Miss Bates comfortable at once.
Good soul!
Miss Bates was as grateful as possible, you may be sure.
'Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'
--but with many, many thanks--'there was no occasion to trouble us, for the carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.'
I was quite surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized.
Such a very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--the sort of thing that so few men would think of.
And, in short, from knowing Mrs. Weston usual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all.
I do suspect Mrs. Weston would not have had a pair of horses for Mrs. Weston, and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them."
"Very likely," said Emma--"nothing more likely.
I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent.
no man is not a gallant man, but no man is a very humane one; and this, considering Miss Fairfax ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley.
I know Mr. Knightley had horses to-day--for we arrived together; and I laughed at Mr. Knightley about it, but Mr. Knightley said not a word that could betray."
"Well," said Mrs. Weston, smiling, "you give Mr. Knightley credit for more simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while Miss Bates Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never been able to get it out again.
The more I think of it, The more probable it appears.
In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Miss Fairfax.
See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to the consequence of keeping you company!--What?"
"Mr. Knightley and Miss Fairfax!"
exclaimed Emma.
"Mrs. Weston, how could you think of such a thing?--Mr.
Knightley!--Mr.
Mr. Knightley must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?-- Oh!
no, no, little Henry must have Donwell.
I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely.
I am amazed that you should think of such a thing."
"Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it.
I do not want the match--I do not want to injure little Henrylittle Henry--but the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry, you would not have Mr. Knightley refrain on little Henry's account, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?"
"Yes, I would.
I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.-- Mr. Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt Henry supplanted.-- Mr. Knightley marry!--No now.
And Miss Fairfax, too, of all women!"
"Nay, Emma has always been a first favourite with Mr. Knightley, as you very well know."
"But the imprudence of such a match!"
"I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability."
"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than what you mention.
His good-nature, His humanity, as I tell you, would be quite enough to account for the horses.
His has a great regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Miss Fairfax--and is always glad to shew them attention.
My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making.
You do to match-making very ill. Miss Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh!
no, no;--every feeling revolts.
For his own sake, I would not have his do so mad a thing."
"Imprudent, if you please--but not mad.
Excepting inequality of fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable."
"But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry.
I am sure Mr. Knightley has not the least idea of it.
Do not put it into Mr. Knightley head.
Why should Mr. Knightley marry?-- Mr. Knightley is as happy as possible by Mr. Knightley; with Mr. Knightley farm, and Mr. Knightley sheep, and Mr. Knightley library, and all the parish to manage; and Mr. Knightley is extremely fond of Mr. Knightley brother's children.
Mr. Knightley has no occasion to marry, either to fill up Mr. Knightley time or Mr. Knightley heart."
"Emma, as long as Mr. Knightley thinks so, it is so; but if Mr. Knightley really loves Jane Fairfax--" "Nonsense!
Mr. Knightley does not care about Miss Fairfax.
In the way of love, I am sure Mr. Knightley does not.
Mr. Knightley would do any good to Miss Fairfax, or Miss Fairfax family; but--" "Well," said Mrs. Weston, laughing, "perhaps the greatest good Mr. Knightley could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home."
"If it would be good to Jane, I am sure it would be evil to Mr. Knightley; a very shameful and degrading connexion.
How would Mr. Knightley bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?--To have Jane haunting the Abbey, and thanking Mr. Knightley all day long for Mr. Knightley great kindness in marrying Jane?-- 'So very kind and obliging!--But Mr. Knightley always had been such a very kind neighbour!'
And then fly off, through half a sentence, to Jane mother's old petticoat.
'Not that it was such a very old petticoat either--for still it would last a great while--and, indeed, Jane must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.'"
"For shame, Emma!
Do not mimic Jane.
You divert me against my conscience.
And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates.
Little things do not irritate Mr. Knightley.
Jane might talk on; and if Mr. Knightley wanted to say any thing himself, Mr. Knightley would only talk louder, and drown Jane voice.
But the question is not, whether it would be a bad connexion for Mr. Knightley, but whether Mr. Knightley wishes it; and I think Mr. Knightley does.
I have heard Mr. Knightley speak, and so must you, so very highly of Miss Fairfax!
The interest Mr. Knightley takes in Jane--Mr. Knightley anxiety about Jane health--Mr. Knightley concern that Jane should have no happier prospect!
I have heard Mr. Knightley express Mr. Knightley so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of Jane performance on the pianoforte, and of her voice!
I have heard Mr. Knightley say that Mr. Knightley could listen to Jane for ever.
Oh!
and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley?
I cannot help suspecting Mr. Knightley.
I think Mr. Knightley is just the person to do it, even without being in love."
"Then it can be no argument to prove that Mr. Knightley is in love.
But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for Mr. Knightley to do.
Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously."
"I have heard Mr. Knightley lamenting Jane having no instrument repeatedly; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of things, occur to Mr.
Knightley."
"Very well; and if Mr. Knightley had intended to give Jane one, Mr. Knightley would have told Jane so."
"There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma.
I have a very strong notion that it comes from Mr. Knightley.
I am sure Mr. Knightley was particularly silent when Jane told us of it at dinner."
"You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have many a time reproached me with doing.
I see no sign of attachment--I believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax."
They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of Emma friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed They that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--and at the same moment Jane approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do They the honour of trying it.
Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of Emma conversation with Mrs. Weston, Emma had been seeing nothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Jane, to add he very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to lead, Emma gave a very proper compliance.
Emma knew the limitations of Emma own powers too well to attempt more than Emma could perform with credit; Emma wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany Emma own voice well.
One accompaniment to Emma song took Emma agreeably by surprize--a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill.
Emma pardon was duly begged at the close of her song, and every thing usual followed.
Frank Churchill was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that Frank Churchill knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted.
They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign Emma place to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, Emma never could attempt to conceal from Emma, was infinitely superior to Emma own.
With mixed feelings, Emma seated Emma at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument, to listen.
Frank Churchill sang again.
They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth.
But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half Emma's mind; and Emma fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions.
Emma objections to Mr. Knightley's marrying did not in the least subside.
Emma could see nothing but evil in it.
It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently to Isabella.
A real injury to the children--a most mortifying change, and material loss to the children all;--a very great deduction from all;--a father's daily comfort--and, as to all;--a, all;--a could not at all endure the idea of Miss Fairfax at Donwell Abbey.
A Mrs. Knightley for them all to give way to!--No--Mr.
Mr. Knightley must never marry.
little Henry little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.
Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by Mr. Knightley.
They talked at first only of the performance.
Mr. Knightley admiration was certainly very warm; yet Mr. Knightley thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have struck Mr. Knightley.
As a sort of touchstone, however, Mr. Knightley began to speak of Mr. Knightley kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though Mr. Knightley answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short, Mr. Knightley believed the matter to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of Mr. Knightley own.
"I often feel concern," said Mr. Knightley, "that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions.
It is not that I am without the wish; but you know how impossible her father would deem it that James should put-to for such a purpose."
"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question," James replied;-- "but you must often wish it, I am sure."
And James smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that Mr. Knightley must proceed another step.
"This present from the Campbells," said she--"this pianoforte is very kindly given."
"Yes," James replied, and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.-- "But they would have done better had they given Mr. Knightley notice of it.
Surprizes are foolish things.
The pleasure is not enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable.
I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell."
From that moment, Emma could have taken Emma oath that Mr. Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument.
But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actual preference--remained a little longer doubtful.
Towards the end of Jane's second song, Jane voice grew thick.
"That will do," said he, when he, was finished, thinking aloud--"you have sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet."
Another song, however, was soon begged for.
"One more;--they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more."
And Frank Churchill was heard to say, "I think you could manage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling.
The strength of her song falls on the second."
Mr. Knightley grew angry.
"That fellow," said That fellow, indignantly, "thinks of nothing but shewing off That fellow own voice.
This must not be."
And touching Miss Bates, who at that moment passed near--"Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing your niece hoarse in this manner?
Go, and interfere.
They have no mercy on your niece."
Miss Bates, in Miss Bates real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to be grateful, before Miss Bates stept forward and put an end to all farther singing.
Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing--originating nobody exactly knew where--was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space.
Mrs. Weston, capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma, had secured Emma hand, and led Emma up to the top.
While waiting till the other young people could pair the other young people off, Emma found time, in spite of the compliments Emma was receiving on Emma voice and Emma taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr. Knightley.
This would be a trial.
He was no dancer in general.
If He were to be very alert in engaging Miss Fairfax now, he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now might augur something.
There was no immediate appearance.
No; He was talking to Jane--He was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else, and He was still talking to Jane.
Emma had no longer an alarm for little Henry; little Henry interest was yet safe; and Emma led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment.
Not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful, and Emma found Emma well matched in a partner.
Not more than five couple were a couple worth looking at.
Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed.
It was growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on Emma mother's account.
After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again, Not more than five couple were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, and have done.
"Perhaps it is as well," said Frank Churchill, as Frank Churchill attended Emma to Emma carriage.
"I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and Miss Fairfax languid dancing would not have agreed with Frank Churchill, after Frank Churchill."
