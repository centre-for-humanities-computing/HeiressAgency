Small heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before Harriet friend called for Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, Harriet evil stars had led Harriet to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to _The Rev. Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath_, was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to convey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk and the direction, was consequently a blank. Harriet went, however; and when they reached the farm, and Harriet was to be put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which had given Harriet so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed Emma to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determined Emma not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour. Emma went on Emma, to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell. The quarter of an hour brought Emma punctually to the white gate again; and Miss Smith receiving Emma summons, was with Emma without delay, and unattended by any alarming young man. Emma came solitarily down the gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with Emma seemingly with ceremonious civility. Emma could not very soon give an intelligible account. Emma was feeling too much; but at Emma Emma collected from Emma enough to understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating. Emma had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. only Mrs. Martin and the two girls had received Emma doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time--till just at last, when a Miss Martin's saying, all of a sudden, that Emma thought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner. In that very room Emma had been measured last September, with Emma two friends. There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window. _He_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day, the hour, the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness, the same regrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and the party, the occasion-- were just growing again like the party, the occasion--, (Harriet, as Emma must suspect, as ready as the best of the party, the occasion-- to be cordial and happy,) when the carriage reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom Emma had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months might resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business. Harriet would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life. the Martins were so deserving, that a _little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could Harriet have done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent. the Martins must be separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--so much to Harriet at this time, that Harriet soon felt the necessity of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it. Harriet mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary. The refreshment of Randalls was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither "master nor mistress was at home;" they had both been out some time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield. "This is too bad," cried Emma, as they turned away. "And now we shall just miss they; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so disappointed." And Emma leaned back in the corner, to indulge Emma murmurs, or to reason they away; probably a little of both--such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the carriage stopt; Emma looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to Emma. There was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston immediately accosted Emma with, "How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father-- glad to see d'ye do?--We so well. Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter this morning--we see d'ye do?--We to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--d'ye do?--We is at Oxford to-day, and d'ye do?--We comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be so. If d'ye do?--We had come at Christmas d'ye do?--We could not have staid three days; I was always glad d'ye do?--We did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have just the right weather for d'ye do?--We, fine, dry, settled weather. we shall enjoy d'ye do?--We completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish." There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of d'ye do?--We wife, fewer and quieter, but not less to the purpose. To know that _she_ thought d'ye do?--We coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did Emma rejoice in their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits. The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought, she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more. Mr. Weston gave she the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which allowed Mr. Weston son to answer for having an entire fortnight at Mr. Weston command, as well as the route and the method of Mr. Weston journey; and she listened, and smiled, and congratulated. "I shall soon bring Mr. Weston over to Hartfield," said Mr. Weston, at the conclusion. Emma could imagine Emma saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from Mr. Weston wife. "We had better move on, Mr. Weston," said Emma, "We are detaining the girls." "Well, well, I am ready;"--and turning again to Emma, "but you must not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only had _my_ account you know; I dare say Mr. Weston is really nothing extraordinary:"--though Mr. Weston own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction. Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing. "Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock," was Mrs. Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only for Emma. "Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three," was Mr. Weston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting. Emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a different air; James and James horses seemed not half so sluggish as before. When Emma looked at the hedges, Emma thought the elder at least must soon be coming out; and when Emma turned round to Harriet, Emma saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there. "Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?"--was a question, however, which did not augur much. But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that neither geography nor tranquillity should neither geography nor tranquillity come in time. The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's faithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o'clock, that Emma was to think of Emma at four. "My dear, dear anxious friend,"--said Emma, in mental soliloquy, while walking downstairs from Emma own room, "always overcareful for every body's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets, going again and again into her own room, to be sure that all is right." The clock struck twelve as Emma passed through the hall. "'Tis twelve; I shall not forget to think of Tis twelve four hours hence; and by this time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here. I am sure their will bring him soon." Emma opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with Emma father--Mr. Weston and her father--Mr son. Weston and his son had been arrived only a few minutes, and Weston had scarcely finished Weston explanation of Frank's being a day before Weston time, and her father--Mr was yet in the midst of her father--Mr very civil welcome and congratulations, when Emma appeared, to have Emma share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure. Mr. Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually before Emma--Mr. Frank Churchill was presented to Emma, and Emma did not think too much had been said in Mr. Frank Churchill praise; Mr. Frank Churchill was a _very_ good looking young man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and Mr. Frank Churchill countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of her father--Mr's; Mr. Frank Churchill looked quick and sensible. Emma felt immediately that Emma should like Mr. Frank Churchill; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced Emma that Mr. Frank Churchill came intending to be acquainted with Emma, and that acquainted they soon must be. Mr. Frank Churchill had reached Randalls the evening before. Emma was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made Mr. Frank Churchill alter Mr. Frank Churchill plan, and travel earlier, later, and quicker, that Mr. Frank Churchill might gain half a day. "I told you yesterday," cried Mr. Weston with exultation, "I told you all that Mr. Weston would be here before the time named. I remembered what I used to do Mr. Weston. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in upon one's friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal more than any little exertion a great deal needs." "It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in It," said the young man, "though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far; but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing." The word _home_ made her father--Mr look on his with fresh complacency. Emma was directly sure that his knew how to make his agreeable; the conviction was strengthened by what followed. his was very much pleased with Randalls, thought Randalls a most admirably arranged house, would hardly allow Randalls even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed his to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one's _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That his should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. his manner had no air of study or exaggeration. his did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment. Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,--"Was she a horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--Pleasant walks?--Had they a large neighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?--There were several very pretty houses in and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Was it a musical society?" But when satisfied on all these points, and they acquaintance proportionably advanced, his contrived to find an opportunity, while they two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his mother-in-law, and speaking of his mother-in-law with so much handsome praise, so much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness his mother-in-law secured to his , and his mother-in-law very kind reception of his, as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please--and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please his mother-in-law. his did not advance a word of praise beyond what his mother-in-law knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly his could know very little of the matter. his understood what would be welcome; his could be sure of little else. "his father's marriage," his said, "had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in the wisest measure; and the family from whom his had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on his." his got as near as his could to thanking his mother-in-law for Miss Taylor's merits, without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to his opinion object, his wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of his mother-in-law person. "Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for," said his; "but I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston." "You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings," said Emma; "were you to guess Emma to be _eighteen_, I should listen with pleasure; but _Emma_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words. Don't let Emma imagine that you have spoken of Emma as a pretty young woman." "I hope I should know better," he replied; "no, depend upon it, (with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms." Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of Emma mind, had ever crossed he; and whether he compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. Emma must see more of he to understand he ways; at present Emma only felt they were agreeable. Emma had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. Mr. Weston quick eye Emma detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression; and even, when Mr. Weston might have determined not to look, Emma was confident that Mr. Weston was often listening. Emma own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the entire deficiency in Mr. Weston of all such sort of penetration or suspicion, was a most comfortable circumstance. Happily Mr. Weston was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.-- Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged, Mr. Weston never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any; it seemed as if Mr. Weston could not think so ill of any two persons' understanding as to suppose any two persons' meant to marry till it were proved against any two persons'. Emma blessed the favouring blindness. Mr. Weston could now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a glance forward at any possible treachery in Mr. Weston guest, give way to all Mr. Weston natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill's accommodation on Mr. Weston journey, through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that Mr. Weston had certainly escaped catching cold--which, however, Mr. Weston could not allow Mr. Weston to feel quite assured of Mr. Weston till after another night. A reasonable visit paid, Weston began to move.--"He must be going. Weston had business at the Crown about Weston hay, and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but Weston need not hurry any body else." Weston son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying, "As you are going farther on business, Mr. Weston, I will take the opportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore may as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name--I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any family of that name?" "To be sure we do," cried her father--Mr; "Mrs. Bates--we passed Mrs. Bates --I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted with FairfaxFairfax; I remember you knew Fairfax at Weymouth, and a fine girl Fairfax is. Call upon Fairfax, by all means." "There is no necessity for my calling this morning," said the young man; "another day would do as well; but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which--" "Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done cannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank; any want of attention to Frank _here_ should be carefully avoided. You saw Frank with the Campbells, when Frank was the equal of every body Frank mixed with, but here Frank is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enough to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight." His son looked convinced. "I have heard Frank speak of the acquaintance," said Emma; "Frank is a very elegant young woman." His son agreed to it, but with so quiet a "Yes," as inclined Frank almost to doubt His son real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it. "If you were never particularly struck by Jane Fairfax manners before," said Jane Fairfax, "I think you will to-day. You will see Jane Fairfax to advantage; see Jane Fairfax and hear Jane Fairfax--no, I am afraid you will not hear Jane Fairfax at all, for Jane Fairfax has an aunt who never holds Jane Fairfax tongue." "You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?" said Mr. Woodhouse, always the last to make sir way in conversation; "then give me leave to assure you that you will find Jane Fairfax a very agreeable young lady. Jane Fairfax is staying here on a visit to Jane Fairfax grandmama and aunt, very worthy people; I have known them all my life. them will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way." "My dear sir, upon no account in the world; her father--Mr can direct me." "But her father--Mr is not going so far; her father--Mr is only going to the Crown, quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk, unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street." Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as Mr. Frank Churchill could, and her father--Mr gave Mr. Frank Churchill hearty support by calling out, "My good friend, this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when Frank sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates's, Frank may get there from the Crown in a hop, step, and jump." They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day, with full confidence in They comfort.
