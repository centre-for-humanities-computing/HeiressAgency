This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure.
It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which Emma walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons, and that they opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in Harriet favour, was peculiarly gratifying.
The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of Emma evening, had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and Emma looked forward to another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.-- From Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom, Emma had strong hopes.
It seemed as if Emma eyes were suddenly opened, and Emma were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior creature Emma had believed Mr. Elton.
The fever was over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy.
Emma depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with Emma, how very happy a summer must be before Emma!
Emma was not to see Frank Churchill this morning.
Frank Churchill had told Emma that Frank Churchill could not allow Frank Churchill the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as Frank Churchill was to be at home by the middle of the day.
Emma did not regret it.
Having arranged all these matters, looked all these matters through, and put them all to rights, Emma was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of spirits grandpapa, when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom Emma had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill, with Harriet leaning on Frank Churchill arm--actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince Emma that something extraordinary had happened.
Harriet looked white and frightened, and Harriet was trying to cheer her.-- The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards The iron gates and the front-door were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away.
A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered, and surprizes be explained.
Such events are very interesting, but the suspense of Such events cannot last long.
A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole.
Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs. Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough for safety, had led Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs. Goddard's, who had been also at the ball into alarm.--About half a mile beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it, the young ladies had suddenly perceived at a small distance before the young ladies, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies.
A child on the watch, came towards the young ladies to beg; and Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet to follow Harriet, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top, and made the best of Harriet way by a short cut back to Highbury.
But Harriet Harriet could not follow.
Harriet had suffered very much from cramp after dancing, and Harriet first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made Harriet absolutely powerless-- and in this state, and exceedingly terrified, Harriet had been obliged to remain.
How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened, Harriet immediately promised not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened money, and taking out Harriet purse, gave not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened a shilling, and begged not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened not to want more, or to use Harriet ill.--She was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was moving away--but Harriet terror and her purse were too tempting, and Harriet was followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.
In this state Frank Churchill had found Harriet, Harriet trembling and conditioning, they loud and insolent.
By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring his to Harriet assistance at this critical moment.
The pleasantness of the morning had induced his to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet his by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury--and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to restore his horses, his had been obliged to stop at Harriet door, and go in for a few minutes: his was therefore later than his had intended; and being on foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to his horses.
The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then the woman and boy own portion.
his had left the woman and boy completely frightened; and Harriet eagerly clinging to his, and hardly able to speak, had just strength enough to reach Hartfield, before Harriet spirits were quite overcome.
It was his idea to bring Harriet to Hartfield: his had thought of no other place.
This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and of Harriet's as soon as Harriet had recovered Harriet senses and speech.-- his dared not stay longer than to see Harriet well; these several delays left his not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of Emma safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, Mr. Knightley set off, with all the grateful blessings that Emma could utter for Emma friend and Emma.
Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain.
So Emma thought, at least.
Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician have seen what Emma did, have witnessed their appearance together, and heard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make their peculiarly interesting to each other?--How much more must an imaginist, like Emma, be on fire with speculation and foresight!--especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as Emma mind had already made.
It was a very extraordinary thing!
Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within Emma memory; no rencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened to the very person, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--And knowing, as Emma did, the favourable state of mind of each at this period, it struck Emma the more.
He was wishing to get the better of He attachment to Emma, Emma just recovering from Emma mania for Mr. Elton.
It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences.
It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other.
In the few minutes' conversation which Emma had yet had with He, while Harriet had been partially insensible, He had spoken of Emma terror, Emma naivete, Emma fervour as Emma seized and clung to He arm, with a sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's own account had been given, He had expressed He indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms.
Every thing was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.
Emma would not stir a step, nor drop a hint.
No, Emma had had enough of interference.
There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.
It was no more than a wish.
Beyond it Emma would on no account proceed.
Emma's first resolution was to keep Emma father from the knowledge of what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm Emma's first resolution would occasion: but Emma soon felt that concealment must be impossible.
Within half an hour Emma's first resolution was known all over Highbury.
It was the very event to engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news.
The last night's ball seemed lost in the gipsies.
Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as Poor Mr. Woodhouse sat, and, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again.
It was some comfort to Poor Mr. Woodhouse that many inquiries after Poor Mr. Woodhouse and Miss Woodhouse (for Poor Mr. Woodhouse neighbours knew that Poor Mr. Woodhouse loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and Poor Mr. Woodhouse had the pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very indifferent--which, though not exactly true, for Poor Mr. Woodhouse was perfectly well, and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with.
Emma had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man, for Emma hardly knew what indisposition was; and if the child of such a man did not invent illnesses for Emma, Emma could make no figure in a message.
the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; the gipsies took the gipsies off in a hurry.
The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before The young ladies of Highbury panic began, and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and Emma nephews:--in Emma imagination it maintained it ground, and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting Harriet right if Harriet varied in the slightest particular from the original recital.
