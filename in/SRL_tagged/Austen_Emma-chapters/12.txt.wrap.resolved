Mr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination of Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with Mr. Knightley in Isabella's first day. Emma's sense of right however had decided right; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, Emma had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr. Knightley and Emma, in procuring him the proper invitation. Emma hoped they might now become friends again. Emma thought it was time to make up. Making-up indeed would not do. _She_ certainly had not been in the wrong, and _She__ would never own that She_ had. Concession must be out of the question; but Concession was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled; and Emma hoped Concession might rather assist the restoration of friendship, that when She_ came into the room Emma had one of the children with Emma--the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months old, who was now making Emma first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced about in Emma aunt's arms. Concession did assist; for though She_ began with grave looks and short questions, She_ was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the child out of her aunt's arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving Emma at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness, Emma could not help saying, as She_ was admiring the baby, "What a comfort it is, that we think alike about we nephews and nieces. As to men and women, we opinions are sometimes very different; but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree." "If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with men and women, as you are where men and women are concerned, we might always think alike." "To be sure--we discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong." "Yes," said he, smiling--"and reason good. I was sixteen years old when you were born." "A material difference then," she replied--"and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of we lives; but does not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring we understandings a good deal nearer?" "Yes--a good deal _nearer_." "But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we think differently." "I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma, let we be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, my dear Emma, that Emma ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances, and that if Emma were not wrong before, Emma is now." "That's true," Emma cried--"very true. my dear Emma, grow up a better woman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited. Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good intentions went, we were _both_ right, and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed." "A man cannot be more so," was A man short, full answer. "Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with Mr. Martin." This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John Knightley made John Knightley appearance, and "How d'ye do, John Knightley?" and "John, how are you?" succeeded in the true English style, burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which would have led either of all but indifference, if requisite, to do every thing for the good of the other. The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with Mr. Woodhouse dear Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions; on one side Mr. Woodhouse and Mr. Woodhouse daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other. The brothers talked of The brothers own concerns and pursuits, but principally of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative, and who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, a magistrate had generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm at Donwell, a magistrate had to tell what every field was to bear next year, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of a magistrate life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into with as much equality of interest by John, as a magistrate cooler manners rendered possible; and if a magistrate willing brother ever left a magistrate any thing to inquire about, a magistrate inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness. While his inquiries were thus comfortably occupied, a magistrate was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with a magistrate daughter. "My poor dear Isabella," said My poor dear Isabella, fondly taking My poor dear Isabella hand, and interrupting, for a few moments, My poor dear Isabella busy labours for some one of My poor dear Isabella five children--"How long it is, how terribly long since you were here! And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early, my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to My poor dear Isabella before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel." My dear Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as My dear Emma did, that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;--and two basins only were ordered. After a little more discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body, the Mr. Knightleys proceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection, "It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air." "Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, the Mr. Knightleys--or we should not have gone. the Mr. Knightleys recommended it for all the children, but particularly for the weakness in little Bella's throat,--both sea air and bathing." "Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing Perry any good; and as to Perry, I have been long perfectly convinced, though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use to any body. I am sure the sea is very rarely of use to any body almost killed me once." "Come, come," cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, "I must beg you not to talk of the sea. this makes me envious and miserable;--I who have never seen this! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Perry yet; and Perry never forgets you." "Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is good Mr. Perry, the Mr. Knightleys?" "Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Perry is bilious, and the Mr. Knightleys has not time to take care of the Mr. Knightleys--the Mr. Knightleys tells me the Mr. Knightleys has not time to take care of the Mr. Knightleys--which is very sad--but the Mr. Knightleys is always wanted all round the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any where." "And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are Mrs. Perry and the children? do the children grow? I have a great regard for Perry. I hope Perry will be calling soon. Perry will be so pleased to see my little ones." "I hope Perry will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask Perry about Perry of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever Perry comes, you had better let Perry look at little Bella's throat." "Oh! the Mr. Knightleys, little Bella's throat is so much better that I have hardly any uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to the Mr. Knightleys, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr. Wingfield's, which we have been applying at times ever since August." "It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use to the Mr. Knightleys--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have spoken to-- "You seem to Perry to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates," said Emma, "I have not heard one inquiry after Mrs. and Miss Bates." "Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of Perry--but you mention Mrs. and Miss Bates in most of your letters. I hope Mrs. and Miss Bates are quite well. Good old Mrs. Bates--I will call upon Good old Mrs. Bates to-morrow, and take my children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.-- And that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!-- How are Mrs. and Miss Bates, the Mr. Knightleys?" "Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago." "How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as colds have been this autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that Mr. Wingfield has never known colds more general or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza." "That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy as Perry has very often known colds in November. Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season." "No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except-- "Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London the truth is always a sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--and the air so bad!" "No, indeed--_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is very superior to most others!--You must not confound Our with London in general, the Mr. Knightleys. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest. Our are so very airy! I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: but _Our_ are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air." "Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it--but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different creatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I think you are any of you looking well at present." "I am sorry to hear you say so, the Mr. Knightleys; but I assure you, excepting those little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere, I am quite well the Mr. Knightleys; and if the children were rather pale before the children went to bed, it was only because the children were a little more tired than usual, from the children journey and the happiness of coming. I hope you will think better of the children looks to-morrow; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that Mr. Wingfield did not believe Mr. Wingfield had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that you do not think John Knightley looking ill," turning John Knightley eyes with affectionate anxiety towards John Knightley husband. "Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think John Knightley very far from looking well." "What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to the Mr. Knightleys?" cried John Knightley, hearing John Knightley own name. "I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you left home." "My my dear Isabella,"--exclaimed my father hastily--"pray do not concern you know about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling you know and the children, and let me look as I chuse." "I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother," cried My dear Emma, "about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailiff from Scotland, to look after Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailiff from Scotland new estate. What will it answer? Will not the old prejudice be too strong?" And My dear Emma talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced to give My dear Emma attention again to My dear Emma father and sister, My dear Emma had nothing worse to hear than My poor dear Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with My dear Emma in general, My dear Emma was at that moment very happy to assist in praising. "That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!" said Mrs. John Knightley.-- "It is so long since I have seen My dear Emma, except now and then for a moment accidentally in town! What happiness it must be to My dear Emma good old grandmother and excellent aunt, when My dear Emma comes to visit her good old grandmother and excellent aunt! I always regret excessively on My dear Emma's account that My dear Emma cannot be more at Highbury; but now her good old grandmother and excellent aunt is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with his daughter at all. his daughter would be such a delightful companion for Emma." a magistrate agreed to it all, but added, "Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty kind of young person. You will like Harriet. My dear Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet." "I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly My dear Emma's age." This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments-- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where its was never met with tolerable;--but, unfortunately, among the failures which his daughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in his daughter own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never had been able to understand what his daughter meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as his daughter had wished for and ordered it, his daughter had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a dangerous opening. "Ah!" said a magistrate, shaking a magistrate head and fixing a magistrate eyes on his daughter with tender concern.--The ejaculation in My dear Emma's ear expressed, "Ah! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It does not bear talking of." And for a little while his daughter hoped a magistrate would not talk of It, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore a magistrate to the relish of a magistrate own smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes, however, a magistrate began with, "I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn, instead of coming here." "But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, sir?--I did the children a great deal of good." "And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End." "I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite a mistake, sir.--We all had sir.--We all health perfectly well there, never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose an unhealthy place unhealthy; and I am sure Mr. Wingfield may be depended on, for Mr. Wingfield thoroughly understands the nature of the air, and Mr. Wingfield own brother and family have been there repeatedly." "You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went Perry Perry was a week at Cromer once, and Perry holds it to be the best of all the sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, Perry says, and very pure air. And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable. You should have consulted Perry." "But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how great it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty." "Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all, better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to Perry a very ill-judged measure." My dear Emma's attempts to stop my father had been vain; and when my father had reached such a point as this, My dear Emma could not wonder at My dear Emma brother-in-law's breaking out. "Perry," said Perry, in a voice of very strong displeasure, "would do as well to keep Perry opinion till it is asked for. Why does Perry make it any business of Perry, to wonder at what I do?--at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.-- I want Perry directions no more than Perry drugs." Perry paused--and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness, "If Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as Perry could Perry." "True, true," cried John Knightley, with most ready interposition-- "very true. That's a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive any difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path. . . . The only way of proving it, however, will be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then our will look the Abbey over, and you shall give me your opinion." a magistrate was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on a magistrate friend Perry, to whom a magistrate had, in fact, though unconsciously, been attributing many of a magistrate own feelings and expressions;--but the soothing attentions of a magistrate daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.
