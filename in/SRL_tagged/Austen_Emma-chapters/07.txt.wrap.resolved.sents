The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma's services towards Emma friend.
Harriet had been at Hartfield, as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to return again to dinner: Harriet returned, and sooner than had been talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something extraordinary to have happened which Harriet was longing to tell.
Half a minute brought it all out.
Harriet had heard, as soon as Harriet got back to Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and finding Harriet was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a little parcel for Harriet from one of Mr. Martin sisters, and gone away; and on opening a little parcel, Harriet had actually found, besides the two songs which Harriet had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to Harriet; and a letter to herself was from Mr. Martin, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage.
"Who could have thought it?
Harriet was so surprized Harriet did not know what to do.
Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter, at least Harriet thought so.
And he wrote as if he really loved Harriet very much--but Harriet did not know--and so, Harriet was come as fast as Harriet could to ask Miss Woodhouse what Harriet should do.--" Emma was half-ashamed of Emma friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.
"Upon my word," Emma cried, "the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking.
"the young man will connect "the young man well if "the young man can."
"Will you read a letter to herself?"
cried Harriet.
"Pray do.
I'd rather you would."
" Emma was not sorry to be pressed. "
Emma read, and was surprized.
The style of a letter to herself was much above " Emma expectation.
There were not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer.
It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. "
Emma paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for Harriet opinion, with a "Well, well," and was at last forced to add, "Is it a good letter?
or is it too short?"
"Yes, indeed, a very good letter," replied " Emma rather slowly--"so good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his sisters must have helped his.
I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express the young man whom I saw talking with you so well, if left quite to the young man whom I saw talking with you own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a woman.
No doubt the young man whom I saw talking with you is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural talent for--thinks strongly and clearly--and when the young man whom I saw talking with you takes a pen in hand, the young man whom I saw talking with you thoughts naturally find proper words.
It is so with some men.
Yes, I understand the sort of mind.
Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point, not coarse.
A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,) than I had expected."
"Well," said the still waiting Harriet;--"well--and--and what shall I do?"
"What shall you do!
In what respect?
Do you mean with regard to this letter?"
"Yes."
"But what are you in doubt of?
You must answer it of course--and speedily."
"Yes.
But what shall I say?
Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me."
"Oh no, no!
the letter had much better be all your own.
You will express Dear Miss Woodhouse very properly, I am sure.
There is no danger of your not being intelligible, which is the first thing.
Your meaning must be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will present gratitude and concern unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded.
You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment."
"You think I ought to refuse his then," said Harriet, looking down.
"Ought to refuse his!
My dear Harriet, what do you mean?
Are you in any doubt as to that?
I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been under a mistake.
I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer.
I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it."
Harriet was silent.
With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued: "You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect."
"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do?
What would you advise me to do?
Pray, Dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do."
"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet.
I will have nothing to do with it.
This is a point which you must settle with your feelings."
"I had no notion that his liked me so very much," said Harriet, contemplating the letter.
For a little while Emma persevered in Emma silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of the letter might be too powerful, Emma thought the letter best to say, "I lay the letter down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as to whether Emma should accept a man or not, Emma certainly ought to refuse a man.
If Emma can hesitate as to 'Yes,' Emma ought to say 'No' directly.
It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with half a heart.
I thought it my duty as a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to yourself.
But do not imagine that I want to influence you."
"Oh!
no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you would just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean that--As you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should not be hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say 'No,' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say 'No?'"
"Not for the world," said Emma, smiling graciously, "would I advise you either way.
You must be the best judge of your own happiness.
If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think Mr. Martin the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you hesitate?
You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition?
Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive Harriet; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion.
At this moment whom are you thinking of?"
The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was still in Harriet hand, the letter was now mechanically twisted about without regard.
Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong hopes.
At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said-- "Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almost made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin.
Do you think I am right?"
"Perfectly, perfectly right, Harriet; you are doing just what you ought.
While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving.
Harriet, I give myself joy of this.
this would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin.
While you were in the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to myself.
I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm.
Now I am secure of Harriet for ever."
Harriet had not surmised Harriet own danger, but the idea of it struck Harriet forcibly.
"You could not have visited me!"
Harriet cried, looking aghast.
"No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before.
That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with Harriet for any thing in the world."
"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it must have been.
You would have thrown Harriet out of all good society.
I must have given you up."
"Dear me!--How should I ever have borne Dear me!--How!
Dear me!--How would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more!"
"Dear affectionate creature!--_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--_You_ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!
I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it.
the young man must have a pretty good opinion of the young man."
"I do not think the young man is conceited either, in general," said Harriet, Harriet conscience opposing such censure; "at least, the young man is very good natured, and I shall always feel much obliged to the young man, and have a great regard for--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know, though the young man may like me, it does not follow that I should--and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people--and if one comes to compare people, person and manners, there is no comparison at all, _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable.
However, I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of Mr. Martin; and Mr. Martin being so much attached to Mr. Martin--and Mr. Martin writing such a letter--but as to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration."
"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.
We will not be parted.
A woman is not to marry a man merely because A woman is asked, or because a man is attached to A woman, and can write a tolerable letter."
"Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too."
Emma felt the bad taste of Emma , but let it pass with a "very true; and it would be a small consolation to Emma, for the clownish manner which might be offending Emma every hour of the day, to know that Emma husband could write a good letter."
"Oh!
yes, very.
Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always happy with pleasant companions.
I am quite determined to refuse her husband.
But how shall I do?
What shall I say?"
Emma assured Emma there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of Emma assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence.
The looking over a good letter again, in replying to a good letter, had such a softening tendency, that a good letter was particularly necessary to brace Emma up with a few decisive expressions; and Emma was so very much concerned at the idea of making his unhappy, and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious that his mother and sisters should not fancy Emma ungrateful, that Emma believed if the young man had come in Emma way at that moment, the young man would have been accepted after all.
a good letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent.
The business was finished, and Harriet safe.
Harriet was rather low all the evening, but Emma could allow for Harriet amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by speaking of Harriet own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton.
"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again," was said in rather a sorrowful tone.
"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet.
You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill."
"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but at Hartfield."
Some time afterwards it was, "I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much surprized if Mrs. Goddard knew what had happened.
I am sure Miss Nash would--for Miss Nash Nash thinks Miss Nash own sister very well married, and it is only a linen-draper."
"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school, Harriet.
I dare say Miss Nash Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married.
Even this conquest would appear valuable in Mrs. Goddard eyes.
As to any thing superior for you, I suppose Mrs. Goddard is quite in the dark.
The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet.
Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves."
Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that people should like Harriet so much.
the idea of Mr. Elton Mr. Elton was certainly cheering; but still, after a time, Harriet was tender-hearted again towards Mr. Martin.
"Now his has got a good letter," said Harriet softly.
"I wonder what they are all doing--whether his sisters know--if his is unhappy, they will be unhappy too.
I hope his will not mind it so very much."
"Let us think of those among us absent friends who are more cheerfully employed," cried Emma.
"At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing your picture to Mr. Elton mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five or six times, allowing his mother and sisters to hear your name, your own dear name."
"My picture!--But My picture!--But has left my picture in Bond-street."
"Has My picture!--But so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton.
No, my dear little modest Harriet, depend upon it my picture in Bond-street will not be in Bond-street till just before My picture!--But mounts My picture!--But horse to-morrow.
It is My picture!--But companion all this evening, My picture!--But solace, My picture!--But delight.
It opens My picture!--But designs to My picture!--But family, It introduces you among his family, It diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm prepossession.
How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!"
Harriet smiled again, and Harriet smiles grew stronger.
