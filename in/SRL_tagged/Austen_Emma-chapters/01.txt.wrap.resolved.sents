Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.
her was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period.
her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.
Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma.
Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters.
Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of governess temper had hardly allowed governess to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what Emma liked; highly esteeming Miss TaylorMiss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by Emma own.
The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having rather too much Emma own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of Emma; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to Emma many enjoyments.
The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with Emma.
Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Miss Taylor married.
It was Miss Miss Taylor's loss which first brought grief.
It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance.
The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, The wedding over father and The wedding over were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening.
The wedding over father composed Her father to sleep after dinner, as usual, and The wedding over had then only to sit and think of what The wedding over had lost.
The event had every promise of happiness for The wedding over .
Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship Mr. Weston had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for Mr. Weston.
The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.
Miss Taylor recalled Miss Taylor past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen years--how Miss Taylor had taught and how Miss Taylor had played with Miss Taylor from five years old--how Miss Taylor had devoted all Miss Taylor powers to attach and amuse Miss Taylor in health--and how nursed Miss Taylor through the various illnesses of childhood.
A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.
Miss Taylor had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in Miss Taylor, in every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom Miss Taylor could speak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for Miss Taylor as could never find fault.
How was Miss Taylor to bear the change?--It was true that Miss Taylor friend was going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all Emma advantages, natural and domestic, Emma was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude.
Emma dearly loved Emma father, but her father was no companion for Emma.
her father could not meet Emma in conversation, rational or playful.
The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early) was much increased by Mr. Woodhouse constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian all Mr. Woodhouse life, without activity of mind or body, Mr. Woodhouse was a much older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of Mr. Woodhouse heart and Mr. Woodhouse amiable temper, Mr. Woodhouse talents could not have recommended Mr. Woodhouse at any time.
Emma sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond Her sister daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and Isabella husband, and Isabella and her husband little children, to fill the house, and give Isabella pleasant society again.
Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded Isabella no equals.
The Woodhouses were first in consequence there.
All looked up to no equals.
Isabella had many acquaintance in the place, for Isabella father was universally civil, but not one among no equals who could be accepted in lieu of Isabella for even half a day.
It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over a melancholy change, and wish for impossible things, till Emma awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.
her father spirits required support.
her father was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that her father was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.
Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and Matrimony was by no means yet reconciled to Matrimony own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of his own daughter but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when Matrimony was now obliged to part with Isabella too; and from Matrimony habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from Matrimony, Matrimony was very much disposed to think Isabella had done as sad a thing for Isabella as for other people, and would have been a great deal happier if Isabella had spent all the rest of Isabella life at Hartfield.
Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as Emma could, to keep Matrimony from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for Matrimony not to say exactly as Matrimony had said at dinner, "Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish Emma were here again.
What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of Emma!"
"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.
Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that Mr. Weston thoroughly deserves a good wife;--and you would not have had Isabella Isabella live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when Isabella might have a house of Isabella own?"
"A house of Isabella own!--But where is the advantage of a house of Isabella own?
This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours, my dear."
"How often we shall be going to see never any odd humours, my dear, and never any odd humours, my dear coming to see us!--We shall be always meeting!
_us_ must begin; us must go and pay wedding visit very soon."
"My dear, how am I to get so far?
Randalls is such a distance.
I could not walk half so far."
"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking.
We must go in the carriage, to be sure."
"The carriage!
But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying we visit?"
"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa.
You know we have settled all that already.
we talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night.
And as for James, you may be very sure James will always like going to Randalls, because of James daughter's being housemaid there.
I only doubt whether James will ever take we anywhere else.
That was your doing, papa.
You got Hannah that good place.
Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned Hannah--James is so obliged to Hannah!"
"I am very glad I did think of Hannah.
It was very lucky, for I would not have had James James think James slighted upon any account; and I am sure Hannah will make a very good servant: Hannah is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of Hannah.
Whenever I see Hannah, Hannah always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had Hannah here to do needlework, I observe Hannah always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs the lock of the door.
I am sure Hannah will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Isabella to have somebody about Hannah that Hannah is used to see.
Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know, his daughter will be hearing of us.
James will be able to tell his daughter how us are."
Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get Emma tolerably through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but Emma own.
The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made The backgammon-table unnecessary.
Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly connected with The backgammon-table, as Mr. Knightley.
Mr. Knightley lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.
Mr. Knightley had returned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square.
It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time.
Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did Mr. Knightley good; and Mr. Knightley many inquiries after "poor Isabella" and Isabella children were answered most satisfactorily.
When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed, "It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us.
I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk."
"Not at all, sir.
It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire."
"But you must have found it very damp and dirty.
I wish you may not catch cold."
"Dirty, sir!
Look at my shoes.
Not a speck on them."
"Well!
that is quite surprising, for us have had a vast deal of rain here.
It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while us were at breakfast.
I wanted we were at breakfast to put off The wedding over."
"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.
Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well.
How did you all behave?
Who cried most?"
"Ah!
poor Miss Taylor!
'Tis a sad business."
"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say 'poor Miss Taylor.'
I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two."
"Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!"
said Emma playfully.
"That is what you have in your head, I know--and what you would certainly say if her father were not by."
"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed," said Mr. Woodhouse, with a sigh.
"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome."
"My dearest papa!
You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean _you_.
What a horrible idea!
Oh no!
I meant only myself.
Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with Mr. Knightley, you know--in a joke--it is all a joke.
We always say what We like to one another."
Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told Emma Woodhouse of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse: and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma , Emma knew it would be so much less so to Emma , that Emma would not have her father really suspect such a circumstance as Emma not being thought perfect by every body.
"Emma knows I never flatter Emma," said Mr. Knightley, "but I meant no reflection on any body.
Isabella Isabella has been used to have two persons to please; Isabella will now have but one.
The chances are that Isabella must be a gainer."
"Well," said Emma, willing to let it pass--"you want to hear about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved charmingly.
Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.
Oh no; we all felt that we all were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every day."
"Emma bears every thing so well," said Emma .
"But, Mr. Knightley, Emma is really very sorry to lose poor Isabella, and I am sure Emma _will_ miss Emma more than Emma thinks for."
Emma turned away Emma head, divided between tears and smiles.
"It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion," said Mr. Knightley.
"We should not like Emma so well as We do, sir, if We could suppose it; but Emma knows how much the marriage is to Isabella's advantage; Emma knows how very acceptable it must be, at Isabella's time of life, to be settled in a home of Emma own, and how important to Emma to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow Emma to feel so much pain as pleasure.
Every friend of Isabella Isabella must be glad to have Isabella so happily married."
"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me," said Emma, "and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself.
I made the match myself, you know, four years ago; and to have the match myself take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing."
Mr. Knightley shook Mr. Knightley head at Mr. Knightley.
Mr. Knightley fondly replied, "Ah!
my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass.
Pray do not make any more matches."
"I promise you to make none for me, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people.
It is the greatest amusement in the world!
And after such success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again.
Oh dear, no!
Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied either in Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife business in town or among Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife friends here, always acceptable wherever Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife went, always cheerful--Mr. Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife did not like it.
Oh no!
Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again.
Some people even talked of a promise to Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife wife on his wife deathbed, and others of the son and the uncle not letting Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife.
All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none of the subject.
"Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Isabella and I met with Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject.
I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making."
"I do not understand what you mean by 'success,'" said Mr. Knightley.
"Success supposes endeavour.
Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about the marriage.
A worthy employment for a young lady's mind!
But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it would be a very good thing for Isabella Isabella if Mr. Weston were to marry Isabella,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success?
Where is your merit?
What are you proud of?
You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be said."
"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?-- I pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon you cleverer-- a lucky guess is never merely luck.
There is always some talent in you cleverer--.
And as to my poor word 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it.
You have drawn two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third--a something between the do-nothing and the do-all.
If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all.
I think you must know Hartfield to comprehend that."
"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational, unaffected woman like Isabella, may be safely left to manage A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational, unaffected woman like Miss Taylor own concerns.
You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational, unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, by interference."
"Emma never thinks of Emma, if Emma can do good to others," rejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part.
"But, my dear, pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one's family circle grievously."
"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton.
Poor Mr. Elton!
You like Mr. Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for Mr. Elton.
There is nobody in Highbury who deserves Mr. Elton--and Mr. Elton has been here a whole year, and has fitted up Mr. Elton house so comfortably, that his house would be a shame to have Mr. Elton single any longer--and I thought when Mr. Elton was joining their hands to-day, Mr. Elton looked so very much as if Mr. Elton would like to have the same kind office done for Mr. Elton!
I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing Mr. Elton a service."
"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young man, and I have a great regard for Mr. Elton.
But if you want to shew Mr. Elton any attention, my dear, ask Mr. Elton to come and dine with us some day.
That will be a much better thing.
I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet Mr.
Knightley."
"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time," said Mr. Knightley, laughing, "and I agree with Mr. Knightley, laughing entirely, that it will be a much better thing.
Invite Mr. Knightley to dinner, Emma, and help Mr. Knightley to the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave Mr. Knightley to chuse Mr. Knightley own wife.
Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of Mr.
Knightley."
