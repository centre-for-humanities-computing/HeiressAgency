Emma did not repent Emma condescension in going to the Coles. The visit afforded Emma many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that Emma might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. Emma must have delighted the Coles--worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind Emma that would not soon die away. Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two points on which Emma was not quite easy. Emma doubted whether Emma had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying Emma suspicions of Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but It had been so strong an idea, that It would escape Emma, and Frank Churchill submission to all that Emma told, was a compliment to Emma penetration, which made it difficult for Emma to be quite certain that Emma ought to have held Emma tongue. The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and there Jane Fairfax had no doubt. Jane Fairfax did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of Jane Fairfax own playing and singing. Jane Fairfax did most heartily grieve over the idleness of Jane Fairfax childhood--and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half. Jane Fairfax was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's praise could have satisfied Jane Fairfax, Jane Fairfax might soon have been comforted. "Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Jane Fairfax's!" "Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like Harriet, than a lamp is like sunshine." "Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite as well as Jane Fairfax does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body last night said how well you played." "Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The truth is, Harriet, that My playing is just good enough to be praised, but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it." "Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as Jane Fairfax's does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste, and that Mr. Frank Churchill valued taste much more than execution." "Ah! but Jane Fairfax's has them both, Harriet." "Are you sure? I saw Jane Fairfax's had execution, but I did not know Jane Fairfax's had any taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.-- There is no understanding a word of it. Besides, if Jane Fairfax's does play so very well, you know, it is no more than Jane Fairfax's is obliged to do, because Jane Fairfax's will have to teach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether Jane Fairfax's would get into any great family. How did you think The Coxes looked?" "Just as they always do--very vulgar." "they told me something," said Harriet rather hesitatingly; "but it is nothing of any consequence." Emma was obliged to ask what they had told Emma, though fearful of its producing Mr. Elton. "they told me--that Mr. Martin dined with they last Saturday." "Oh!" "He came to they father upon some business, and He asked He to stay to dinner." "Oh!" "they talked a great deal about He, especially Anne Cox. I do not know what Anne Cox meant, but Anne Cox asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer." "Anne Cox meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should be." "Anne Cox said He was very agreeable the day He dined there. He sat by Anne Cox at dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry He." "Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar girls in Highbury." Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go with Harriet. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in Harriet present state, would be dangerous. Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always very long at a purchase; and while Harriet was still hanging over Mr. Perry and changing Harriet mind, Harriet went to the door for amusement.--Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;-- Mr. Perry walking hastily by, such an Anne Cox letting such an Anne Cox in at the office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects Harriet could presume to expect; and when Harriet eyes fell only on the butcher with such an Anne Cox tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with Harriet full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, Harriet knew Harriet had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer. Harriet looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons appeared; Mrs. Weston and Harriet son-in-law; two persons were walking into Highbury;--to Hartfield of course. two persons were stopping, however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught two persons eye.--Immediately two persons crossed the Randalls road and came forward to Emma; and the agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Weston was going to call on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument. "For my companion tells me," said Mrs. Weston, "that I absolutely promised Mrs. Bates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it Mrs. Weston. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as Mrs. Weston says I did, I am going now." "And while Mrs. Weston pays Mrs. Weston visit, I may be allowed, I hope," said Frank Churchill, "to join your party and wait for Mrs. Weston at Hartfield--if you are going home." Mrs. Weston was disappointed. "I thought you meant to go with Mrs. Weston. Frank Churchill, "to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield-- would be very much pleased." "Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps--I may be equally in the way here. Mrs. Bates looks as if Mrs. Bates did not want me. My aunt always sends me off when My aunt is shopping. My aunt says I fidget My aunt to death; and Mrs. Bates Mrs. Bates looks as if My aunt could almost say the same. What am I to do?" "I am here on no business of my own," said Emma; "I am only waiting for my friend. my friend will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home. But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument." "Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone--what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston. Mrs. Weston might do very well by Mrs. Weston. A disagreeable truth would be palatable through Mrs. Weston lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood." "I do not believe any such thing," replied Emma.--"I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night." "Do come with me," said Mrs. Weston, "if it be not very disagreeable to you. it need not detain us long. us will go to Hartfield afterwards. us will follow last night to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant It." me could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward me, returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched them in, and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all the force of Emma own mind, to convince Emma that if Emma wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be it ever so beautiful, would still never match Emma yellow pattern. At last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel. "Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?" asked Mrs. Ford.-- "Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield. No, you shall send Only my pattern gown to Hartfield, if you please. But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take Only my pattern gown. But I shall want the ribbon directly--so the ribbon had better go to Hartfield--at least the ribbon. You could make the ribbon into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?" "It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two parcels." "No more it is." "No trouble in the world, ma'am," said Mrs. Ford. "Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's-- I do not know--No, I think, Mrs. Bates, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night. What do you advise?" "That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford." "Aye, that will be much best," said Harriet, quite satisfied, "I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's." Voices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Bates Bates met Voices at the door. "My dear Miss Woodhouse," said the latter, "I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while, and give us your opinion of us new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding." "I hope Mrs. Bates and Jane Fairfax's are--" "Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well; and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.-- Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Mrs. Bates will allow me just to run across and entreat Mrs. Bates to come in; My mother will be so very happy to see Mrs. Bates--and now us are such a nice party, Mrs. Bates cannot refuse.--'Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, 'Mrs. Bates's opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'-- But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--'Oh,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, 'Miss Woodhouse's opinion of the instrument, 'wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;'--For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there Mr. Frank Churchill, 'Miss Woodhouse's opinion of the instrument is, in the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of My mother's spectacles.--The rivet came out, you know, this morning.-- So very obliging!--For My mother had no use of My mother spectacles--could not put no use of her spectacles on. And, by the bye, every body ought to have two pair of spectacles; no use of her spectacles should indeed. Jane said so. I meant to take no use of her spectacles over to John Saunders the first thing I did, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing, then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty came to say Patty thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I, Patty do not come with your bad news to Patty. Here is the rivet of your mistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis sent the baked apples by Mrs. Wallis boy; the baked apples are extremely civil and obliging to us, the Wallises, always--I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but us have never known any thing but the greatest attention from the baked apples. And it cannot be for the value of us custom now, for what is us consumption of bread, you know? Only three of us.--besides dear Jane at present--and Jane really eats nothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw such a shocking breakfast. I dare not let My mother know how little Jane eats--so I say one thing and then I say another, and another passes off. But about the middle of the day Jane gets hungry, and there is nothing Jane likes so well as these baked apples, and these baked apples are extremely wholesome, for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet Mr. Perry in the street. Not that I had any doubt before-- I have so often heard Mrs. Bates recommend a baked apple. I believe a baked apple is the only way that Mrs. Bates thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. us have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will oblige us." Emma would be "very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.," and these ladies did at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Mrs. Bates than, "How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before. I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well--only a little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking the gloves in." "What was I talking of?" said Jane, beginning again when the gloves were all in the street. Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, Emma would fix. "I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! My mother's spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! 'Oh!' said Mr. Frank Churchill, 'I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind excessively.'--Which you know shewed Mr. Frank Churchill to be so very. . . . Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of Mr. Frank Churchill before and much as I had expected, Mr. Frank Churchill very far exceeds any thing. . . . I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly. Mr. Frank Churchill seems every thing the fondest parent could. . . . 'Oh!' said Mr. Frank Churchill, 'I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort excessively.' I never shall forget Mr. Frank Churchill manner. And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some, 'Oh!' said Mr. Frank Churchill directly, 'there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you know, was so very. . . . And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does they full justice--only we do not have they baked more than twice, and Mrs. Bates made we promise to have they done three times--but Mrs. Bates Mrs. Bates will be so good as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell--some of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply. Mr. Knightley sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of Mr. Knightley trees--I believe there is two of his trees. My mother says the orchard was always famous in My mother younger days. But I was really quite shocked the other day--for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating The apples themselves, and us talked about The apples themselves and said how much Jane enjoyed The apples themselves, and Mr. Knightley asked whether us were not got to the end of us stock. 'I am sure you must be,' said Mr. Knightley, 'and I will send you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more, before some get good for nothing.' So I begged William Larkins would not--for really as to us being gone, I could not absolutely say that us had a great many left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but half a dozen indeed should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all bear that William Larkins should be sending us more, so liberal as William Larkins had been already; and Jane said the same. And when William Larkins was gone, Jane almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say quarrelled, for us never had a quarrel in us lives; but Jane was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; Jane wished I had made William Larkins believe us had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see William Larkins. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort William master had; William had brought them all--and now his master had not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it William, William was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master's profit than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, William said, was quite displeased at their being all sent away. Mrs. Hodges could not bear that Mrs. Hodges should not be able to have another apple-tart this spring. William told Patty this, but bid Mrs. Hodges not mind this, and be sure not to say any thing to us about this, for Mrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were sold, this did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world! Mr. Knightley would be so very. . . . I wanted to keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was aware." Mrs. Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and Patty visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to, pursued only by the sounds of Patty desultory good-will. "Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take care, Mrs. Bates, ours is rather a dark staircase--rather darker and narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Mrs. Bates, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss Smith, the step at the turning."
