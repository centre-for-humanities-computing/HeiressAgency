Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest daughter. The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry, and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest; but nothing now remained of its, save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad--of him widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl. By birth birth belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on losing birth mother, birth became the property, the charge, the consolation, the fondling of birth grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every probability of birth being permanently fixed there; of birth being taught only what very limited means could command, and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what nature had given birth in a pleasing person, good understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations. But the compassionate feelings of a friend of birth father gave a change to birth destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to an excellent officer and most deserving young man for such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man believed had saved an excellent officer and most deserving young man life. These were claims which an excellent officer and most deserving young man did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax, before an excellent officer and most deserving young man own return to England put any thing in an excellent officer and most deserving young man power. When an excellent officer and most deserving young man did return, an excellent officer and most deserving young man sought out an excellent officer and most deserving young man and took notice of an excellent officer and most deserving young man. an excellent officer and most deserving young man was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about Jane's age: and Jane became only one living child, a girl, about Jane's age guest, paying only one living child, a girl, about Jane's age long visits and growing a favourite with all; and before Jane was nine years old, an excellent officer and most deserving young man daughter's great fondness for Jane, and an excellent officer and most deserving young man own wish of being a real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of Jane education. It was accepted; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with Colonel Campbell's family entirely, only visiting Jane grandmother from time to time. The plan was that Jane should be brought up for educating others; the very few hundred pounds which Jane inherited from Jane father making independence impossible. To provide for Jane otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though Colonel Campbell income, by pay and appointments, was handsome, Colonel Campbell fortune was moderate and must be all Colonel Campbell daughter's; but, by giving Jane an education, Colonel Campbell hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter. Such was Jane Fairfax's history. Jane had fallen into good hands, known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent education. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people, Jane heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters. Jane disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen Jane was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children, fully competent to the office of instruction Jane; but Jane was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor mother could promote, and all his daughter could not endure it. The evil day was put off. The evil day was easy to decide that all his daughter was still too young; and Jane remained with she was still too young, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of all his daughter own good understanding to remind all his daughter that all this might soon be over. The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements. That nature had given That nature in feature could not be unseen by the young woman, nor could the young woman higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents. the parents continued together with unabated regard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as the parents were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet Jane Fairfax bread to earn. This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by Jane Fairfax less fortunate friend towards entering on Jane Fairfax path of duty; though Jane Fairfax had now reached the age which Jane Fairfax own judgment had fixed on for beginning. Jane Fairfax had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, Jane Fairfax had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever. The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a resolution, though The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell feelings did. As long as The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell lived, no exertions would be necessary, The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell home might be hers for ever; and for The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell own comfort The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell would have retained her wholly; but this would be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell began to feel this might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still, however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment. her had never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage; and till her should have completely recovered her usual strength, their must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort. With regard to her not accompanying regard to her to Ireland, her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not told. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom her was so very dear: and the Campbells, whatever might be whom motive or motives, whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement whom ready sanction, and said, that whom depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that her was to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two years' absence. Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person Emma did not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than Emma wished, and less than Emma ought! Why Emma did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told Emma it was because Emma saw in Emma the really accomplished young woman, which Emma wanted to be thought Emma; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which Emma conscience could not quite acquit Emma. But "Emma could never get acquainted with Emma: Emma did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether Emma pleased or not--and then, Emma aunt was such an eternal talker!--and her aunt was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate--because they ages were the same, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other." These were Emma reasons--Emma had no better. It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy, that Emma never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence, without feeling that Emma had injured Emma; and now, when the due visit was paid, on Emma arrival, after a two years' interval, Emma was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners, which for those two whole years Emma had been depreciating. Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and Jane Fairfax had Jane Fairfax the highest value for elegance. Jane Fairfax height was pretty, just such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; Jane Fairfax figure particularly graceful; Jane Fairfax size a most becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all this; and then, Emma face--Emma features--there was more beauty in them altogether than Emma had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty. Emma eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows praise; but the skin, which Emma had been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, Emma must, in honour, by all Emma principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person or of mind, Emma saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction, and merit. In short, Emma sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice, and was determining that Emma would dislike Emma no longer. When Emma took in Emma , indeed, Emma situation, as well as Emma beauty; when Emma considered what all this elegance was destined to, what Emma was going to sink from, how Emma was going to live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling Emma to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which Emma had so naturally started to Emma. In that case, nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices Emma had resolved on. Emma was very willing now to acquit Emma of having seduced Mr. Dixon's actions from Mr. Dixon wife, or of any thing mischievous which Emma imagination had suggested at first. If it were love, it were love might be simple, single, successless love on Emma side alone. Emma might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his conversation with Emma friend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be denying Emma this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide Emma effectually from his and his connexions by soon beginning Emma career of laborious duty. Upon the whole, Emma left Emma with such softened, charitable feelings, as made Emma look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving Emma independence; nobody that Emma could wish to scheme about for Emma. These were charming feelings--but not lasting. Before Emma had committed Emma by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, "Emma certainly is handsome; Emma is better than handsome!" Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with Jane grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into every thing usual state. Former provocations reappeared. her aunt was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her aunt health was now added to admiration of her aunt powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter her aunt ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her aunt mother and her aunt; and Jane's offences rose again. they had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to Emma an affectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style Emma own very superior performance. Emma was, besides, which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no getting at Emma real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, Emma seemed determined to hazard nothing. Emma was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved. If any thing could be more, where all was most, Emma was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. Emma seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or Emma own value for Mr. Dixon company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It was all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished. It did Emma no service however. Emma caution was thrown away. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to Emma first surmises. There probably _was_ something more to conceal than Emma own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds. The like reserve prevailed on other topics. Emma and Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time. She and Mr. Frank Churchill was known that She and Mr. Frank Churchill were a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what Frank Churchill truly was. "Was Frank Churchill handsome?"--"She believed Frank Churchill was reckoned a very fine young man." "Was Frank Churchill agreeable?"-- "Frank Churchill was generally thought so." "Did Frank Churchill appear a sensible young man; a young man of information?"--"At a watering-place, or in a common London acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than Manners had yet had of Frank Churchill. She believed every body found Frank Churchill manners pleasing." Emma could not forgive Emma.
