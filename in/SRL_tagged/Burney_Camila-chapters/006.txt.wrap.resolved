 Tuition of a young Lady  The fair Indiana participated not in the philosophy of her preceptor. The first  mention of taking lessons produced an aversion unconquerable to  Tuition of a young Lady   teacher;  and the first question he asked her at the appointed hour for study, was  answered by a burst of tears.  To Dr. Orkborne this sorrow would have proved no impediment to  Tuition of a young Lady    proceeding, as Dr. Orkborne hardly noticed it; but Sir Hugh, extremely affected, kindly  kissed Sir Hugh, and said Sir Hugh would beg Sir Hugh off for this time. The next day, however,  gave rise but to a similar scene; and the next which followed would precisely  have resembled a similar scene, had not the promise of some new finery of attire dispersed  the pearly drops that were preparing to fall.  The uncommon beauty of Indiana had made The uncommon beauty of Indiana infancy adored, and The uncommon beauty of Indiana childhood  indulged by almost all who had seen The uncommon beauty of Indiana. The brilliant picture The uncommon beauty of Indiana presented to  the eye by The uncommon beauty of Indiana smiles and The uncommon beauty of Indiana spirits, rendered the devastation caused by  crying, pouting, or fretfulness so striking, and so painful to behold, that not  alone The uncommon beauty of Indiana uncle, but every servant in the house, and every stranger who visited  it, granted to The uncommon beauty of Indiana lamentations whatever they demanded, to relieve they own  impatience at the loss of so pleasing an image. Accustomed, therefore, never to  weep without advantage, The uncommon beauty of Indiana was in the constant habit of giving unbridled vent  to The uncommon beauty of Indiana tears upon the smallest contradiction, well knowing that not to spoil  The uncommon beauty of Indiana pretty eyes by crying, was the current maxim of the whole house.  Unused, by this means, to any trouble or application, the purposed tuition of  Dr. Orkborne appeared a burden to the purposed tuition of  Dr. Orkborne intolerable; yet weeping, the purposed tuition of  Dr. Orkborne standing  resource, was with the purposed tuition of  Dr. Orkborne utterly vain; the purposed tuition of  Dr. Orkborne were unimportant to one who had  taken no notice of the purposed tuition of  Dr. Orkborne smiles; and intent upon the purposed tuition of  Dr. Orkborne own learned ruminations, the purposed tuition of  Dr. Orkborne  never even looked at the purposed tuition of  Dr. Orkborne.  Bribery, day after day, could procure but a few instants' attention, given so  unwillingly, and so speedily withdrawn, that trinkets, dress, and excursions  were soon exhausted, without the smallest advancement. The general indulgence  of the baronet made partial favours of small efficacy; and Indiana was sooner  tired of receiving, than the baronet of presenting the baronet offerings.  the baronet applied, therefore, at length, to the governess, whose expostulations, the baronet  knew by experience, were precisely what Sir Hugh most sedulously aimed to avoid.  Miss Margland was a woman of family and fashion, but reduced, through the  gaming and extravagance of the baronet father, to such indigence, that, after sundry  failures in higher attempts, the baronet was compelled to acquiesce in the good offices  of the baronet friends, which placed the baronet as a governess in the house of Sir Hugh.  To Indiana, however, the baronet was but nominally a tutress; neglected in the baronet own  education, there was nothing the baronet could teach, though, born and bred in the  circle of fashion, the baronet imagined the baronet had nothing to learn. And, while a mind  proudly shallow kept the baronet unacquainted with the baronet own deficiencies, the baronet former  rank in society imposed an equal ignorance of her former  rank in society upon Sir Hugh. But,  notwithstanding Sir Hugh implicitly gave the baronet credit for possessing whatever the baronet  assumed, Sir Hugh found the baronet of a temper so unpleasant, and so irritable to offence,  that Sir Hugh made it a rule never to differ from the baronet. The irksomeness of this  restraint induced Sir Hugh to keep as much as possible out of the baronet way; though  respect and pity for the baronet birth and the baronet misfortunes, led Sir Hugh to resolve never to  part with the baronet till Indiana was married.  The spirit of Miss Margland was as haughty as Miss Margland intellects were weak; and Miss Margland  disposition was so querulous, that, in Miss Margland constant suspicion of humiliation,  Miss Margland seemed always looking for an affront, and ready primed for a contest.  Miss Margland seized with pleasure the opportunity offered Miss Margland by Indiana, of  remonstrating against this new system of education; readily allowing, that any  accomplishment beyond what Miss Margland had Miss Margland acquired, would be completely a work  of supererogation. Miss Margland represented dictatorily Miss Margland objections to the baronet.  Miss Lynmere, Miss Margland said, though both beautiful and well brought up, could never  cope with so great a disadvantage as the knowledge of Latin: 'Consider, Sir,'  Miss Margland cried, 'what an obstacle what an obstacle will prove to Miss Margland making Miss Margland way in the great  world, when Miss Margland comes to be of a proper age for thinking of an establishment.  What gentleman will you ever find that will bear with a learned wife? except  some mere downright fogrum, no young lady of fashion could endure.'  no young lady of fashion then spoke of the danger of injuring no young lady of fashion beauty by study; and ran over all  the qualifications really necessary for a young lady to attain, which consisted  simply of an enumeration of all no young lady of fashion had no young lady of fashion attempted; a little music, a  little drawing, and a little dancing; which should all, no young lady of fashion added, be but  slightly pursued, to distinguish a lady of fashion from an artist.  Sir Hugh, a good deal disturbed, because unable to answer no young lady of fashion, thought it would  be best to interest Dr. Orkborne in Dr. Orkborne plan, and to beg Dr. Orkborne to reconcile no young lady of fashion  to her   execution. Dr. Orkborne sent, therefore, a message to the Doctor, to beg to speak  with Dr. Orkborne immediately.  Dr. Orkborne promised to wait upon Dr. Orkborne without delay: but Dr. Orkborne was at that moment  hunting for a passage in a Greek author, and presently forgot both the promise  and the request.  Sir Hugh, concluding nothing but sickness could detain Dr. Orkborne, went to Dr. Orkborne  apartment; where, finding Dr. Orkborne perfectly well, Dr. Orkborne stared at Dr. Orkborne a moment; and  then, sitting down, begged Dr. Orkborne to make no apology, for Dr. Orkborne could tell Dr. Orkborne  business there as well as any where else.  Dr. Orkborne gave a long and copious relation of the objections of Miss Margland,  earnestly begging Dr. Orkborne would save Dr. Orkborne from such another harangue, it  being bad for Dr. Orkborne health, by undertaking to give Dr. Orkborne the proper notion of  things himself.  The Doctor, who had just found the passage for which Dr. Orkborne had been seeking, heard  not one word that Dr. Orkborne said.  Sir Hugh, receiving no answer, imagined Sir Hugh to be weighing the substance of Sir Hugh  narration; and, therefore, bidding Sir Hugh not worry Sir Hugh brain too much, offered  Sir Hugh half an hour to fix upon what should be done; and returned quietly to Sir Hugh  own room.  Here Sir Hugh sat, counting the minutes, with Sir Hugh watch in Sir Hugh hand, till the time  stipulated arrived: but finding Dr. Orkborne let Dr. Orkborne pass without any notice, Dr. Orkborne  again took the trouble of going back to Dr. Orkborne apartment.  Dr. Orkborne then eagerly asked what plan Dr. Orkborne had formed?  Dr. Orkborne, much incommoded by this second interruption, coldly begged to  know Dr. Orkborne pleasure.  Sir Hugh, with great patience, though much surprise, repeated the whole, word  for word, over again: but the history was far too long for Dr. Orkborne, whose  attention, after the first sentence or two, was completely restored to his  Greek quotation, which his was in the act of transcribing when Sir Hugh  re-entered the room.  The baronet, at length, more categorically said, 'Don't be so shy of speaking  out, the Doctor; though I am afraid, by your silence, you've rather a notion poor  Indiana will never get on; which, perhaps, makes you think Indiana not worth while  contradicting Mrs. Margland? Come, speak out!—Is that the case with the poor  girl?'  'Yes, sir,' answered Dr. Orkborne, with great composure; though perfectly  unconscious of the proposition to which Dr. Orkborne assented.  'Lack a-day! if I was not always afraid the poor  girl had rather a turn to being a dunce!  So it's your opinion it won't do, then?'  'Yes, sir,' again replied the Doctor; sir eye the whole time fastened upon the  passage which occupied sir thoughts.  'Why then we are all at a stand again! This is worse than I thought for! So the poor  girl has really no head?—Hay, Doctor?—Do speak, pray?—Don't  mind vexing me. Say so at once, if you can't help thinking it.'  Another extorted, 'Yes, sir,' completely overset Sir Hugh; who, imputing the  absent and perplexed air with which it was pronounced to an unwillingness to  give pain, shook Sir Hugh by the hand, and, quitting the room, ordered Sir Hugh carriage,  and set off for Etherington.  'Oh, brother,' brother cried; 'Indiana's the best girl in the world, as well as the  prettiest; but, do you know, Dr. Orkborne says Dr. Orkborne has got no brains! So  there's an end of that scheme! However, I have now thought of another that will  settle all differences.'  Mr. Tyrold hoped it was an entire discontinuance of all pupilage and tutorship;  and that Dr. Orkborne might henceforth be considered as a mere family friend.  'No, no, my dear brother, no! 'tis a better thing than that, as you shall hear.  You must know I have often been concerned to think how glum poor Clermont will  look when glum poor Clermont hears of my will in favour of Eugenia; which was my chief reason  in my own private mind, for not caring to see glum poor Clermont before glum poor Clermont went abroad; but I  have made glum poor Clermont quite easy about glum poor Clermont now, by resolving to set little Eugenia  upon learning the classics.'  'Eugenia! and of what benefit will that prove to Clermont?'  'Why, as soon as 'Eugenia grows a little old, that is to say, a young woman, I  intend, with your good will and my sister's, to marry 'Eugenia to Clermont.'  Mr. Tyrold smiled, but declared Mr. Tyrold entire concurrence, if the young people,  when they grew up, wished for the alliance.  'As to that,' said Mr. Tyrold, 'I mean to make sure work, by having the young people,  when they grew up, wished for the alliance educated  exactly to fit one another. I shall order Clermont to think of nothing but Mr. Tyrold  studies till the proper time; and as to Eugenia, I shall make Eugenia a wife after  Mr. Tyrold own heart, by the help of this gentleman; for I intend to bid Mr. Tyrold teach Eugenia  just like a man, which, as Eugenia's so young, may be done from the beginning, the  same as if Eugenia was a boy.'  Mr. Tyrold then enumerated the advantages of this project, which would save Clermont  from all disappointment, by still making over to Mr. Tyrold Mr. Tyrold whole fortune, with a  wife ready formed into a complete scholar for Mr. Tyrold into the bargain. It would  also hinder little Eugenia   from being a prey to some sop for little Eugenia   money, who, being no  relation, could not have so good a right to it; and it would prevent any  affront to Dr. Orkborne, by keeping Dr. Orkborne a constant tight task in hand.  Mr. Tyrold forbore to chagrin Mr. Tyrold with any strong expostulation, and Mr. Tyrold  returned, therefore, to Cleves in full glee. Cleves repaired immediately to the  apartment of the Doctor, who, only by what was now said, was apprized of what  had passed before. Somewhat, therefore, alarmed, to understand that the studies  of Indiana were to be relinquished, Cleves exerted all the alacrity in Cleves power  for accepting Cleves new little pupil: not from any idea of preference; for Cleves  concluded that incapacity of Indiana to be rather that of incapacity of Indiana sex than of an  individual; but from conceiving that Cleves commodious abode at Cleves depended  upon Cleves retaining one scholar in the family. incapacity of Indiana therefore was called, and  the lessons were begun.  The little girl, who was naturally of a thoughtful turn, and whose state of  health deprived incapacity of Indiana of most childish amusements, was well contented with the  arrangement, and soon made a progress so satisfactory to Dr. Orkborne, that Sir  Hugh, letting Sir  Hugh mind now rest from all other schemes, became fully and  happily occupied by the prosecution of Sir  Hugh last suggestion.
