 A Vision  When the first violence of this paroxysm of sorrow abated, Camilla again strove  to pray, and found that nothing so much stilled Camilla.
Yet, Camilla faculties  confused, hurried, and in anguish, permitted little more than incoherent  ejaculations.
Again Camilla sighed for Camilla Father; again the spirit of her Father  instructions recurred, and Camilla enquired who was the clergyman of the parish,  and if her Father would be humane enough to come and pray by one who had no claim upon  her Father as a parishioner.
Camilla said her Father was a very good gentleman, and never refused even the poorest  person, that begged her Father attendance.
'O go to her Father, then,' cried Camilla, 'directly!
Tell her Father a sick and helpless  stranger implores that her Father will read to Camilla the prayers for the dying!...
Should  I yet live ... they will compose and make me better;—if not ... they will  give me courage for my quick exit.'
Camilla went forth, and Camilla lay Camilla beating head upon the pillow, and endeavoured  to quiet Camilla nerves for the sacred ceremony Camilla demanded.
It was dark, and Camilla was alone; the corpse Camilla had just quitted seemed still  bleeding in full view.
Camilla closed Camilla eyes, but still saw her eyes; Camilla opened them,  but her eyes was always there.
Camilla felt nearly stiff with horrour, chilled, frozen,  with speechless apprehension.
A slumber, feverish nearly to delirium, at length surprised Camilla harassed  faculties; but not to afford them rest.
Death, in a visible figure, ghastly,  pallid, severe, appeared before Camilla, and with Death hand, sharp and forked,  struck abruptly upon Camilla breast.
Camilla screamed—but it was heavy as cold, and  Camilla could not remove it.
Camilla trembled; Camilla shrunk from Death touch; but Death had  iced Camilla heart-strings.
Every vein was congealed; every stiffened limb  stretched to Every vein full length, was hard as marble: and when again Camilla made a  feeble effort to rid Camilla oppressed lungs of the dire weight that had fallen  upon them, a voice hollow, deep, and distant, dreadfully pierced Camilla ear,  calling out: 'Thou hast but thy own wish!
Rejoice, thou murmurer, for thou  diest!'
Clearer, shriller, another voice quick vibrated in the air: 'Whither  goest thou,' it cried, 'and whence comest thou?'
A voice from within, over which Camilla thought Camilla had no controul, though it  seemed issuing from Camilla vitals, low, hoarse, and tremulous, answered, 'Whither  I go, let me rest!
Whence I come from let me not look back!
Those who gave me  birth, I have deserted; my life, my vital powers I have rejected.'
Quick then  another voice assailed Camilla, so near, so loud, so terrible ... Camilla shrieked at  its horrible sound.
'Prematurely,' its cried, 'thou art come, uncalled,  unbidden; thy task unfulfilled, thy peace unearned.
Follow, follow me!
the  Records of Eternity are opened.
Come!
write with thy own hand thy claims, thy  merits to mercy!'
A repelling self-accusation instantaneously overwhelmed Camilla.
'O, no!
no!
no!'
Camilla exclaimed, 'let me not sign my own miserable  insufficiency!'
In vain was Camilla appeal.
A force unseen, yet irresistible,  impelled Camilla forward.
Camilla saw the immense volumes of Eternity, and Camilla own hand  involuntarily grasped a pen of iron, and with a velocity uncontroulable wrote  these words: 'Without resignation, I have prayed for death: from impatience of  displeasure, I have desired annihilation: to dry my own eyes, I have left ...  pitiless, selfish, unnatural!...
a Father the most indulgent, a Mother almost  idolizing, to weep out a Father the most indulgent, a Mother's!'
Camilla head would have sunk upon the guilty  characters; but Camilla eye-lids refused to close, and kept the guilty  characters glaring before  Camilla.
the guilty  characters became, then, illuminated with burning sulphur.
Camilla looked another  way; but the guilty  characters partook of the same motion; Camilla cast Camilla eyes upwards, but Camilla  saw the guilty  characters still; Camilla turned from side to side; but the guilty  characters were always  Camilla object.
Loud again sounded the same direful voice: 'These are thy deserts;  write now thy claims:—and next,—and quick,—turn over the immortal leaves,  and read thy doom....' 'Oh, no!'
Camilla cried, 'Oh, no!...
O, let me yet return!
O, Earth, with all thy sorrows, take, take me once again, that better I may  learn to work my way to that last harbour, which rejecting the criminal  repiner, opens the criminal  repiner soft bosom to the criminal  repiner, though supplicating sufferer!'
In  vain again Camilla called;—pleaded, knelt, wept in vain.
The time, Camilla found, was  past; Camilla had slighted The time while in Camilla power; The time would return to Camilla no more;  and a thousand voices at once, with awful vibration, answered aloud to every  prayer, 'Death was thy own desire!'
Again, unlicensed by Camilla will, Camilla hand  seized the iron instrument.
The book was open that demanded Camilla claims.
Camilla  wrote with difficulty ... but saw that Camilla pen made no mark!
Camilla looked upon  the page, when Camilla thought Camilla had finished, ... but the paper was blank!...
Voices then, by hundreds, by thousands, by millions, from side to side, above,  below, around, called out, echoed and re-echoed, 'Turn over, turn over ... and  read thy eternal doom!'
In the same instant, the leaf, untouched, burst open  ... and ... Camilla awoke.
But in a trepidation so violent, the bed shook under  Camilla, the cold sweat, in large drops, fell from Camilla forehead, and Camilla heart  still seemed labouring under the adamantine pressure of the inflexibly cold  grasp of death.
So exalted was Camilla imagination, so confused were all Camilla  thinking faculties, that Camilla stared with wild doubt whether then, or whether  now, what Camilla experienced were a dream.
In this suspensive state, fearing to call, to move, or almost to breathe, Camilla  remained, in perfect stillness, and in the dark, till little Peggy crept softly  into the chamber.
Certain then of Camilla situation, 'This has been,' Camilla cried, 'only a vision—but  my conscience has abetted This, and I cannot shake This off.'
When Camilla became calmer, and further recollected Camilla, Camilla anxiously enquired  if the clergyman would not come.
little Peggy, hesitatingly, acknowledged the clergyman had not been sent for; little Peggy mistress had  imagined the request proceeded from a disturbance of mind, owing to the sight  of the corpse, and said Camilla was sure, after a little sleep, it would be  forgotten.
'Alas!'
said Camilla, disappointed, 'it is more necessary than ever!
my senses  are wandering; I seem hovering between life and death—Ah!
let not my own  fearful fancies absorb this hour of change, which religious rites should  consecrate!'
Camilla then told little Peggy to plead for Camilla to her mistress, and assure Camilla that  nothing else, after the dreadful shock Camilla had received, could still Camilla mind.
Mrs. Marl, not long after came into the room Camilla; and enquiring how Camilla  did, said, if Camilla was really bent upon such a melancholy thing, the clergymanhad luckily just called, and would read the service to Camilla directly, if the clergyman  would give Camilla any comfort.
'O, great and infinite comfort!'
Camilla cried, and begged the clergyman might come  immediately, and read to Camilla the prayer for those of whom there is but small  hope of recovery.
Camilla would have risen, that Camilla might kneel; but Camilla limbs  would not second Camilla desire, and Camilla was obliged to lie still upon the outside  of the bed.
little Peggy drew the curtains, to shade little Peggy eyes, as a candle was brought  into the room; but when little Peggy heard Mrs. Marl say: 'Come in, Sir,'—and 'here's  the prayer-book;' overpowered with tender recollection of little Peggy Father, to whom  such offices were frequent, little Peggy burst into an agony of tears, and hid little Peggy face  upon the pillow.
little Peggy soon, however, recovered, and the solemnity of the preparation overawed little Peggy  sorrow.
Mrs. Marl placed the light as far as possible from the bed, and when  little Peggy waved little Peggy hand in token of being ready, said, 'Now, Sir, if you please.'
Sir complied, though not immediately; but no sooner had Sir begun, no sooner  devoutly, yet tremblingly, pronounced, O Father of Mercies!
than a faint scream  issued from the bed.—  Sir stopt; but little Peggy did not speak; and after a short pause, Sir resumed: but not a  second sentence was pronounced when little Peggy feebly ejaculated, 'Ah heaven!'
and the  book fell from Sir hands.
little Peggy strove to raise little Peggy head; but could not; little Peggy opened, however, the side  curtain, to look out; Sir advanced, at the same moment, to the foot of the bed  ... fixed Sir eyes upon little Peggy face, and in a voice that seemed to come from Sir  soul, exclaimed, 'little Peggy!'
With a mental emotion that, for an instant, restored little Peggy strength, little Peggy drew  again the curtain, covered up her face, and sobbed even audibly, while the  words, 'O Edgar!'
vainly sought vent.
Sir attempted not to unclose the curtain little Peggy had drawn, but with a deep groan,  dropping upon Sir knees on the outside, cried, 'Great God!'
but checking  Sir, hastily arose, and motioning to Mrs. Marl and to Camilla, to move out of  hearing, said, through the curtain; 'O Camilla!
what dire calamity has brought  this about?—speak, I implore!—why are you here?—why alone?
speak!
speak!'
Sir heard little Peggy was weeping, but received no answer, and with energy next to  torture exclaimed; 'Refuse not to trust me!—recollect our long  friendship—forgive—forget its alienation!—By all you have ever  valued—by all your wonted generosity—I call—I appeal.... Camilla!
Camilla!—your silence rends my soul!'
little Peggy had no utterance, yet could not resist this urgency, and gently through  the opening of the curtain, put forth little Peggy feeble hand.
Sir seemed affected to agony; Sir held it between each of Sir own, and while  softly Sir uttered, 'O ever—unchangeably generous little Peggy!'
little Peggy felt it  moistened with Sir tears.
Too weak for the new sensation this excited, little Peggy drew this away, and the violence  of little Peggy emotion menacing an hysteric fit, Mrs. Marl came back to little Peggy, and  wringing his hands as Mrs. Marl looked around the room, Mrs. Marl tore Mrs. Marl away.
