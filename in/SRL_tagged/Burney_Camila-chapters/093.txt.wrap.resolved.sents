 Juvenile Calculations  Mrs. Norfield, a lady whom circumstances had brought into some intimacy with  Mrs. Berlinton upon Mrs. Berlinton marriage, had endeavoured, from the first of Mrs. Berlinton  entrance into high life, to draw Mrs. Berlinton into a love of play; not with an idea of  doing Mrs. Berlinton any mischief, for Mrs. Berlinton was no more Mrs. Berlinton enemy than Mrs. Berlinton friend; but to  answer Mrs. Berlinton own purposes of having a Faro table under Mrs. Berlinton own direction.
Mrs. Berlinton was  a woman of fashion, and as such every-where received; but Mrs. Berlinton fortune was  small, and Mrs. Berlinton passion for gaming inordinate; and as there was not, at this  time, one Faro table at Southampton, whither Mrs. Berlinton was ordered for Mrs. Berlinton health,  Mrs. Berlinton was almost wearied into a lethargy, till Mrs. Berlinton reiterated intreaties  prevailed, at length, with Mrs. Berlinton to hold one at Mrs. Berlinton own house.
The fatigue of life without view, the peril of talents without prudence, and  the satiety of pleasure without intermission, were already dangerously  assaulting the early independence and the moment of vacancy and weariness was  seized by Mrs. Norfield, to press the essay of a new mode of amusement.
Mrs. Berlinton's house opened, failed not to be filled; and opened for a Farotable, to be filled with a peculiar set.
To game has, unfortunately, always game  attractions; to game with a perfect novice is not what will render game less  alluring; and to see a perfect novice rich and beautiful is still less likely to be  repelling.
Mrs. Berlinton, when Mrs. Berlinton made this marriage, supposed Mrs. Berlinton had engaged for life a  fair nurse to Mrs. Berlinton infirmities; but when Mrs. Berlinton saw a  fair nurse fixed aversion, Mrs. Berlinton had not  spirit to cope with her fixed aversion; and when a  fair nurse had always an excuse for a separation, Mrs. Berlinton  had not the sense to acquaint Mrs. Berlinton how a  fair nurse passed a  fair nurse time in Mrs. Berlinton absence.
A  natural imbecility of mind was now nearly verging upon dotage, and as Mrs. Berlinton rarely  quitted Mrs. Berlinton room but at meal times, a  fair nurse made a point never to see Mrs. Berlinton in any  other part of the day.
a  fair nurse antipathy rendered a  fair nurse obdurate, though a  fair nurse  disposition was gentle, and a  fair nurse had now left Mrs. Berlinton at Tunbridge, to meet a  fair nurse aunt  at Southampton, with a knowledge Mrs. Berlinton was too ill to follow a  fair nurse, and a  determination, upon various pretences, to stay away from Mrs. Berlinton for some months.
The ill fate of such unequal alliances is almost daily exemplified in life; and  though few young brides of old bridegrooms fly their mates thus openly and  decidedly, their retainers have seldom much cause to rejoice in superior  happiness, since their are generally regarded but as the gaolers of their young  prey.
Moderation was the last praise to which Mrs. Berlinton had any claim; what Mrs. Berlintonentered upon through persecution, in an interval of mental supineness, Mrs. Berlinton was  soon awake to as a pleasure, and next pursued as a passion.
Mrs. Berlinton beloved  correspondent was neglected; Mrs. Berlinton favourite authors were set aside; Mrs. Berlinton country  rambles were given up; balls and the rooms were forgotten; and Faro alone  engrossed Her beloved  correspondent faculties by day, and Her beloved  correspondent dreams during the short epoch Her beloved  correspondent  reserved for sleep at night.
Her beloved  correspondent lost, as might be expected, as constantly as  Her beloved  correspondent played; but as money was not what Her beloved  correspondent naturally valued, Her beloved  correspondent disdained to  weigh that circumstance; and so long as Her beloved  correspondent had any to pay, resigned she had with  more grace than by others she had was won.
That Her beloved  correspondent was not caught by this ruinous fascination, was not simply the  effect of necessity.
Had the state of Her beloved  correspondent finances been as flourishing as the state of her finances  was decayed, Her beloved  correspondent would have been equally steady in this forbearance: Her beloved  correspondent reason  was fair, though Her beloved  correspondent feelings frequently chased the state of her finances from the field.
Her beloved  correspondent looked  on, therefore, with safety, though not wholly with indifference; Her beloved  correspondent had too  much fancy not to be amused by the spirit of the business, and was too animated  not to take part in the successive hopes and fears of the several competitors;  but though Her beloved  correspondent quick sensations prompted a readiness, like that of Mrs.  Berlinton, to enter warmly into all that was presented to Her beloved  correspondent, the resemblance  went no further; what Her beloved  correspondent was once convinced was wrong Her beloved  correspondent was incapable of  practising.
Upon Gaming, the first feeling and the latest reflection are commonly one; both  point its hazards to be unnecessary, its purposes rapacious, and its end  desperate loss, or destructive gain; Her beloved  correspondent not only, therefore, held back; Her beloved  correspondent  took the liberty, upon the privilege of their avowed friendship, to remonstrate  against this dangerous pastime with Mrs.  Berlinton.
But Her beloved  correspondent, though  eminently designed to be amiable, had now contracted the fearful habit of  giving way to every propensity; and finding Her beloved  correspondent native notions of happiness  were blighted in the bud, concluded that all which now remained for Her beloved  correspondent was the  indulgence of every luxury.
Her beloved  correspondent heard with sweetness the expostulation of Her beloved  correspondent  young friend; but Her beloved  correspondent pursued Her beloved  correspondent own course.
In a very few days, however, while the blush of shame dyed Her beloved  correspondent beautiful  cheeks, Her beloved  correspondent inquired if Camilla could lend Camilla a little ready money.
A blush of no less unpleasant feelings overspread the face of Her beloved  correspondent fair guest,  in being compelled to own Her beloved  correspondent had none to lend; but Her beloved  correspondent eagerly promised to  procure some from Mrs. Mittin, who had a note in Her beloved  correspondent hand to exchange for the  payment of some small debts contracted at Tunbridge.
Mrs. Berlinton, gathering,  from Her beloved  correspondent confusion, how ill Her beloved  correspondent was stored, would not hear of applying to this  resource, 'though I hate,' Her beloved  correspondent cried, 'to be indebted to that odious old  cousin, of whom I was obliged to borrow last night.'
Glaring imprudence in others is a lesson even to the most unthinking; Camilla,  when Her beloved  correspondent found that Mrs. Berlinton had lost every guinea Her beloved  correspondent could command,  ventured to renew still more forcibly Her beloved  correspondent exhortations against the Faro table;  but Mrs. Berlinton, notwithstanding Her beloved  correspondent possessed an excellent capacity, was so  little fortified with any practical tenets either of religion or morality, that  where sentiment did not take the part of what was right, Her beloved  correspondent had no  preservative against what was wrong.
the Faro table, therefore, was still  opened; and Lord Valhurst, by the sums Lord Valhurst lent, obtained every privilege of  intimacy in the family, except that of being welcome.
Against this perilous mode of proceeding Camilla was not the only warner.
Mrs.  Ulst saw with extreme repugnance the mode of life Ulst niece was pursuing, and  reprimanded her niece with severe reproach; but her niece influence was now lost; and Mrs.  , though her niece kindly attended her niece, and sought to alleviate her niece  sufferings, acted as if her niece were not in existence.
It was now Mrs.   gained the highest point of Mrs.   ambition; Mrs.  Berlinton, tired of remonstrances Mrs.   could not controvert, and would not  observe, was extremely relieved by finding a person who would sit with Mrs.    aunt, comply with Mrs.   humours, hear Mrs.   lamentations, subscribe to Mrs.    opinions, and beguile Mrs.   of Mrs.   rigid fretfulness by the amusement of  gossiping anecdotes.
Mrs.   had begun life as the apprentice to a small country milliner; but  had rendered Mrs.   so useful to a sick elderly gentlewoman, who lodged in the  house, that Mrs.   left Mrs.   a legacy, which, by sinking into an annuity, enabled  Mrs.   to quit Mrs.   business, and set up, in Mrs.   own conception, for a gentlewoman  Mrs.  ; though with so very small an income, that to sustain Mrs.   new post, Mrs.    was frequently reduced to far greater dependence and hardships than Mrs.    experienced in Mrs.   old one.
Mrs.   was good-humoured, yet laborious; gay, yet  subservient; poor, yet dissipated.
To be useful, Mrs.   would submit to any  drudgery; to become agreeable, devoted Mrs.   to any flattery.
To please was  Mrs.   incessant desire, and Mrs.   rage for popularity included every rank and class  of society.
The more eminent, of course, were Mrs.   first objects, but the same  aim descended to the lowest.
Mrs.   would work, read, go of errands, or cook a  dinner; be a parasite, a spy, an attendant, a drudge; keep a secret, or spread  a report; incite a quarrel, or coax contending parties into peace; invent any  expedient, and execute any scheme ... all with the pretext to oblige others,  but all, in fact, for simple egotism; as prevalent in Mrs.   mind as in that of  the more highly ambitious, though meaner and less dangerous.
Her beloved  correspondent was much relieved when Her beloved  correspondent found this officious person was no longer  retained solely upon Her beloved  correspondent account; but still Her beloved  correspondent could neither obtain Her beloved  correspondent bills,  no answers ever arriving, nor the money for Her beloved  correspondent twenty pound note, Mrs.  always evading to deliver Mrs.  , and asserting Mrs.   was sure somebody would come in  the stage the next day for the payment Mrs.   had promised; and when Her beloved  correspondentwanted cash for any of the very few articles Mrs.   now allowed Mrs.   to think  indispensable, instead of restoring Mrs.   into Mrs.   hands, Mrs.   flew out Mrs.   to  purchase the goods that were required, and always brought cash home with  assurances cash were cheaper than the shopkeepers would let Mrs.   have cash for  Mrs.  .
Her beloved  correspondent resisted all incitements to new dress and new ornaments, with a  fortitude which must not be judged by the aged, nor the retired, who weighing  only the frivolity of what Her beloved  correspondent withstood, are not qualified to appreciate the  merit of this sort of resignation; the young, the gay, the new in life, who  know that, amongst minor calamities, none are more alarming to the juvenile  breast than the fear of not appearing initiated in the reigning modes, can  alone do justice to the present philosophy of Camilla, in seeing that all Camilla  wore, by the quick changes of fashion, seemed already out of date; in refusing  to look at the perpetual diversity of apparel daily brought, by various dress  modellers, for the approbation of Mrs. Berlinton, and in seeing Her beloved  correspondentalways newly, brightly, and in a distinguished manner attired, yet appearing by  Her beloved  correspondent side in exactly the same array that Her beloved  correspondent had constantly worn at Tunbridge.
Nor was Her beloved  correspondent indifferent to this contrast; but Her beloved  correspondent submitted to it as the  duty of Her beloved  correspondent present involved situation, which exacted from Her beloved  correspondent every privation,  in preference to bestowing upon any new expence the only sum Her beloved  correspondent could command  towards clearing what was past.
But, after a very short time, the little wardrobe exhibited a worse quality  than that of not keeping pace with the last devices of the ton; it lost not  merely it newness, but it delicacy.
Alas!
thought Her beloved  correspondent, how long, in the  careful and rare wear of Etherington and Cleves, all this would have served me;  while here, in this daily use, a fortnight is scarce passed, yet all is spoilt  and destroyed.
Ah!
public places are only for the rich!
Now, therefore, Mrs.   was of serious utility; Mrs.   failed not to observe  the declining state of Mrs.   attire; and though Mrs.   wondered at the parsimony  which so resolutely prohibited all orders for the declining state of her attire renewal, in a young lady Mrs.    considered as so great an heiress, Mrs.   was yet proud to display Mrs.   various  powers of proving serviceable.
Mrs.   turned, changed, rubbed, cleaned, and new  made up all the several articles of which Mrs.   dress was composed, to so much  advantage, and with such striking effect, that for yet a few days more all  seemed renewed, and by the arts of some few alterations, Mrs.   appearance was  rather more than less fashionable than upon Mrs.   first arrival.
But this could not last long; and when all, again, was fading into a state of  decay, Mrs. Berlinton received an invitation for Mrs. Berlinton and Mrs. Berlinton fair guest, to  a great ball and supper, given upon the occasion of a young nobleman's coming  of age, in which all the dancers, by agreement, were to be habited in uniform.
This uniform was to be clear fine lawn, with lilac plumes and ornaments.
Her beloved  correspondent had now, with consuming regret, passed several days without one sight  of Edgar.
This invitation, therefore, which was general to all the company at  Southampton, was, in Southampton first sound, delicious; but became, upon  consideration, the reverse.
Clear lawn and lilac plumes and ornaments Her beloved  correspondent had  none; how to go Her beloved  correspondent knew not; yet Edgar Her beloved  correspondent was sure would be there; how to  stay away Her beloved  correspondent knew less.
This was a severe moment to Her beloved  correspondent courage; Her beloved  correspondent felt This faltering, and putting  down the card of invitation, without the force of desiring Mrs.  Berlinton to  make Her beloved  correspondent excuse, repaired to Her beloved  correspondent own room, terrified by the preponderance of  Her beloved  correspondent wishes to a consent which Her beloved  correspondent knew Her beloved  correspondent situation rendered unwarrantable.
There, however, though Her beloved  correspondent gained time for reflection, Her beloved  correspondent gathered not the  resolution Her beloved  correspondent sought.
The stay at Southampton, by the desire of Lynmere, had  been lengthened; yet only a week now remained, before Her beloved  correspondent must return to Her beloved  correspondent  father and Her beloved  correspondent uncle ... but how return?
separated from Edgar?
Edgar whom Her beloved  correspondent  still believed Her beloved  correspondent had only to see again in some more auspicious moment, to  re-conquer and fix for life!
But when and where might that auspicious moment be  looked for?
not at Mrs. Berlinton's; there not at Mrs. Berlinton no more attempted to visit: not  at the Rooms; those now were decidedly relinquished, and all general  invitations were inadequate to draw Mrs. Berlinton from Mrs. Berlinton new pursuit: where,  then, was this happy explanation to pass?
When our wishes can only be gratified with difficulty, our conclude, in the  ardour of combating their obstacle, that to lose their, is to lose everything,  to obtain their is to ensure all good.
At this ball, and this supper, Her beloved  correspondentpainted Edgar completely restored to Her beloved  correspondent; Her beloved  correspondent was certain Her beloved  correspondent would dance with  Her beloved  correspondent; Her beloved  correspondent was sure Her beloved  correspondent would sit by no one else during the repast; the many days  since they had met would endear to Her beloved  correspondent every moment they could now spend  together, and Her beloved  correspondent active imagination soon worked up scenes so important from  this evening, that Her beloved  correspondent next persuaded Her beloved  correspondent belief that all chance of  reconciliation hung wholly upon the meeting it offered.
Impelled by this notion, yet wavering, dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, Her beloved  correspondent  summoned Mrs.  , and entreated Her beloved  correspondent would make such inquiries concerning  the value of the ball-dress uniform, as would enable Her beloved  correspondent to estimate its entire  expence.
Her beloved  correspondent hours passed now in extreme disquietude; for while all Her beloved  correspondent hopes centred in  the approaching festival, the estimate which was to determine Her beloved  correspondent power of  enjoying it was by no means easy to procure.
Mrs.  , though an adept in  such matters, took more pleasure in the parade than in the performance of Her beloved  correspondent  task; and always answered to Her beloved  correspondent inquiries, that it was impossible to speak so  soon; that Her beloved  correspondent must go to such another shop first; that Her beloved  correspondent must consult with  such and such a person; and that Her beloved  correspondent must consider over more closely the orders  given by Mrs. Berlinton, which were to be Her beloved  correspondent direction, though with the  stipulation of having materials much cheaper and more common.
At length, however, Her beloved  correspondent burst into Her beloved  correspondent room, one morning, before Her beloved  correspondent was  dressed, saying: 'Now, my dear miss, I hope I shall make you happy;' and  displayed, upon the bed, a beautiful piece of fine lawn.
Her beloved  correspondent examined and admired it, asked what it was a yard, and how much would  suffice for the dress.
'Why, my dear, I'll answer for the dress there's enough for three whole dresses; why  it's a whole piece; and I dare say I can get a handkerchief and an apron out of  it into the bargain.'
'But I want neither handkerchief, nor apron, nor three dresses, Mrs. Mittin; I  shall take the smallest quantity that is possible, if I take any at all.'
Mrs.   said that the man would not cut it, and Mrs.   must take the whole, or  none.
Her beloved  correspondent was amazed Her beloved  correspondent could so far have misunderstood Her beloved  correspondent as to bring it upon  such terms, and begged Her beloved  correspondent would carry it back.
'Nay, if you don't take this, my dear, there's nothing in the shops that comes  near it for less than fifteen shillings a-yard; Mrs. Berlinton gives eighteen  for Mrs. Berlinton, and it don't look one bit to choose; and this, if you take it all  together, you may have for ten, for all its width, for there's 30 yards, and  the piece comes to but fifteen pound.'
Her beloved  correspondent protested Her beloved  correspondent would not, at this time, pay ten shillings a-yard for any  gown in the world.
Mrs. Mittin, who had flattered Her beloved  correspondent that the handkerchief and apron, at  least, if not one of the gowns, would have fallen to Her beloved  correspondent share, was much  discomposed by this unexpected declaration; and disappointed, murmuring, and  conceiving Her beloved  correspondent the most avaricious of mortals, was forced away; leaving Her beloved  correspondentin complete despondence of any power to effect Her beloved  correspondent wish with propriety.
Mrs.   came back late, and with a look of dismay; the man of whom Mrs.   had  had the muslin, who was a traveller, whom Mrs.   had met at a friend's, had not  waited Mrs.   return; and, as Mrs.   had left the fifteen pounds with the man of whom she had  , for a  pledge of the security of the man of whom she had   goods, Mrs.   supposed the man of whom she had   had made off, to get rid  of the whole piece at once.
Her beloved  correspondent felt petrified.
No possible pleasure or desire could urge Her beloved  correspondent,  deliberately, to what Her beloved  correspondent deemed an extravagance; yet here, in one moment, Her beloved  correspondent  was despoiled of three parts of all Her beloved  correspondent possessed, either for Her beloved  correspondent own use, or  towards the restitution of Her beloved  correspondent just debts with others.
Observing Her beloved  correspondent distress, though with more displeasure than pity, from believing  believing   founded in the most extraordinary covetousness, Mrs.   proposed  measuring the piece in three, and disposing of the two gowns Mrs.   did not want  to Mrs. Berlinton, or Mrs.   sister and Miss Lynmere.
Her beloved  correspondent was a little revived; but the respite of difficulty was short; upon  opening the piece, the piece was found damaged; and after the first few yards, which  Mrs.   had sedulously examined, not a breadth had escaped some rent, fray,  or mischief.
The ill being now irremediable, to make up the dress in the cheapest manner  possible was the only consolation that remained.
Mrs.   knew a  mantua-maker who, to oblige Mrs.  , would undertake this for a very small payment;  and Mrs.   promised to procure everything else that was necessary for the merest  trifle.
Determined, however, to risk nothing more in such hands, Mrs.   now positively  demanded that the residue of the note should be restored to Mrs.   own keeping.
Mrs.  , though much affronted, honestly refunded the five pounds.
The  little articles Mrs.   had occasionally brought were still unpaid for; but Mrs.    passion for detaining the money was merely with a view to give Mrs.    consequence, in boasting how and by whom Mrs.   was trusted, and now and then  drawing out Mrs.   purse, before those who had less to produce; but wholly without  any design of imposition or fraud; all Mrs.   could obtain by hints and address  Mrs.   conceived to be fair booty; but further Mrs.   went not even in thought.
Three days now only remained before this event-promising ball was to take  place, and within three after it, the Southampton expedition was to close.
Her beloved  correspondent scarce breathed from impatience for the important moment, which was  preceded by an invitation to all the company, to take a sail on the Southampton  water on the morning of the entertainment.
