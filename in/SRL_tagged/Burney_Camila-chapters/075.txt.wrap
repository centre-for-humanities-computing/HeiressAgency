 The Triumph of Pride  The three sisters were retired, at night, to another council in the room of  Camilla, when Molly Mill, with a look of dismay, burst in upon them, bringing,  with the answer of Sir Sedley, news that Tommy Hodd, by an accident he could  not help, had rode the horse she had borrowed for him of the under-groom to  death.  The dismay, now, spread equally to them all. What a tale would this misfortune  unfold to Sir Hugh, to Edgar, to the whole house! The debt of Lionel, the  correspondence with Sir Sedley, the expectations of the young baronet....  Camilla could not support it; she sent for Jacob to own to him the affair, and  beg his assistance.  Jacob, though getting into bed, obeyed the call. He was, however, so much  irritated at the loss of the horse, and the boldness of the under-groom, in  lending him without leave, that, at first, he would listen to no entreaties,  and protested that both the boy and Molly Mill should be complained of to his  master. The eloquence, however, of his three young mistresses, for so all the  nieces of Sir Hugh were called by the servants at Cleves, soon softened his  ire; he almost adored his master, and was affectionately attached to the young  family. They begged him, therefore, to buy another horse, as like it as  possible, and to contrive not to employ it when Sir Hugh was in sight, till  they were able to clear up the history to their uncle themselves: this would  not be difficult, as the baronet rarely visited his stables since his fall,  from the melancholy with which he was filled by the sight of his horses.  There was to be a fair for cattle in the neighbourhood the next day, and Jacob  promised to ride over to see what bargain he could make for them.  They then inquired about what money would be necessary for the purchase.  The cost, he said, of poor Tom Jones was 40Â£.  Camilla held up her hands, almost screaming. Eugenia, with more presence of  mind, said they would see him again in the morning before he went, and then  told Molly Mill to wait for her in her own room.  'What can I now do?' cried Camilla; 'I would not add the history of this  dreadful expence to the sad tale I have already to relate to Edgar for the  universe! To begin my career by such a string of humiliations would be  insupportable. Already I owe five guineas to Mrs. Arlbery, which the tumult of  my mind since my return has prevented me from naming to my uncle; and I have  left debts at Tunbridge that will probably take up all my next quarter's  allowance!'  'As far as these three guineas will go,' said Lavinia, taking out her purse,  'here, my dearest Camilla, they are; ... but how little that is! I never before  thought my pittance too small! yet how well we all know my dear father cannot  augment it.'  Eugenia, who, in haste, had stept to her own room, now came back, and putting  twenty guineas into the hand of Camilla, said: 'This, my beloved sister, is all  I now have by me; but Jacob is rich and good, and will rejoice to pay the rest  for us at present; and I shall very soon reimburse him, for my uncle has  insisted upon making me a very considerable present, which I shall, now, no  longer refuse.'  Camilla burst into tears, and, hanging about their necks: 'O my sisters,' she  cried, 'what goodness is yours! but how can I avail myself of it with any  justice? Your three guineas, my Lavinia, your little all ... how can I bear to  take?'  'Do not teach me to repine, my dear Camilla, that I have no more! I am sure of  being remembered by my uncle on the approaching occasions, and I can never,  therefore, better spare my little store.'  'You are all kindness! and you my dear Eugenia, though you have more, have  claims upon that more, and are both expected and used to answer them....'  'Yes, I have indeed more!' interrupted Eugenia, 'which only sisters good as  mine could pardon; but because my uncle has made me his heiress, has he made me  a brute? No! whatever I have, must be amongst us all in common, not only now,  but ...' She stopt, affrighted at the idea she was presenting to herself, and  fervently clasping her hands, exclaimed: 'O long ... long may it be ere I can  shew my sisters all I feel for them! they will believe it, I am sure ... and  that is far happier!'  The idea this raised struck them all, at the same moment, to the heart. Not one  of them had dry eyes, and with a sadness over-powering every other  consideration, they sighed as heavily, and with looks as disconsolate, as if  the uncle so dear to them were already no more.  The influence of parts, the predominance of knowledge, the honour of learning,  the captivation of talents, and even the charm of fame itself, all shrink in  their effects before the superior force of goodness, even where most simple and  uncultivated, for power over the social affections.  At an early hour, the next morning the commission, with the twenty guineas in  hand, and the promise of the rest in a short time, were given to Jacob; and  Camilla, then, begged permission of her father, and the carriage of her uncle,  to visit Mrs. Arlbery, who, she had heard, was just returned to the Grove.  Concluding she wished to be the messenger of her own affairs to that lady, they  made no opposition, and she set off before eight o'clock, without entering the  parlour, where Edgar, she was informed, was already arrived for breakfast.  The little journey was terrible to her; scenes of disappointment and despair on  the part of Sir Sedley, were anticipated by her alarmed imagination, and she  reproached herself for every word she had ever spoken, every look she had ever  given, that could have raised any presumption of her regard.  The last note was written in the style of all the others, and not one ever  expressed the smallest doubt of success; how dreadful then to break to him such  news, at the very moment he might imagine she came to meet him with partial  pleasure!  Mrs. Arlbery was not yet risen. Camilla inquired, stammering, if any company  were at the house. None, was the answer. She then begged leave to walk in the  garden till Mrs. Arlbery came down stairs.  She was not sorry to miss her; she dreaded her yet more than Sir Sedley  himself, and hoped to see him alone.  Nevertheless, she remained a full hour in waiting, ruminating upon the wonder  her disappearance would give to Edgar, and nearly persuaded some chance had  anticipated her account to Sir Sedley, whose rage and grief were too violent to  suffer him to keep his appointment.  This idea served but to add to her perturbation, when, at last, she saw him  enter the garden.  All presence of mind then forsook her; she looked around to see if she could  escape, but his approach was too quick for avoidance. Her eyes, unable to  encounter his, were bent upon the ground, and she stood still, and even  trembling, till he reached her.  To the prepossessed notions and vain character of Sir Sedley, these were  symptoms by no means discouraging; with a confidence almost amounting to  arrogance he advanced, pitying her distress, yet pitying himself still more for  the snare in which it was involving him. He permitted his eyes for a moment to  fasten upon her, to admire her, and to enjoy triumphantly her confusion in  silence: 'Ah, beauteous tyrant!' he then cried; 'if this instant were less  inappreciable, in what language could I upbraid thy unexampled abuse of power?  thy lacerating barbarity?'  He then, almost by force, took her hand; she struggled eagerly to recover it,  but 'No,' he cried, 'fair torturer! it is now my prisoner, and must be punished  for its inhuman sins, in the congealing and unmerciful lines it has portrayed  for me.'  And then, regardless of her resistance, which he attributed to mere  bashfulness, he obstinately and incessantly devoured it with kisses, in  defiance of opposition, supplication, or anger, till, suddenly and piercingly,  she startled him with a scream, and snatched it away with a force irresistible.  Amazed, he stared at her. Her face was almost convulsed with emotion; but her  eyes, which appeared to be fixed, directed him to the cause. At the bottom of  the walk, which was only a few yards distant, stood Mandlebert.  Pale and motionless, he looked as if bereft of strength and faculties. Camilla  had seen him the moment she raised her eyes, and her horror was uncontrollable.  Sir Sedley, astonished at what he beheld, astonished what to think, drew back,  with a supercilious kind of bow. Edgar, recalled by what he thought insolence  to his recollection, advanced a few steps, and addressing himself to Camilla,  said: 'I had the commands of Sir Hugh to pursue you, Miss Tyrold, to give you  immediate notice that Mr. Lynmere is arrived.' He added no more, deigned not a  look at Sir Sedley, but rapidly retreated, remounted his horse, and galloped  off.  Camilla looked after him till he was out of sight, with uplifted hands and  eyes, deploring his departure, his mistake, and his resentment, without courage  to attempt stopping him.  Sir Sedley stood suspended, how to act, what to judge. If Edgar's was the  displeasure of a discarded lover, why should it so affect Camilla? if of a  successful one, why came she to meet him? why had she received and answered his  notes?  Finding she attempted neither to speak nor move, he again approached her, and  saying, 'Fair Incomprehensible!...' would again have taken her hand; but  rousing to a sense of her situation, she drew back, and with some dignity, but  more agitation, cried: 'Sir Sedley, I blush if I am culpable of any part of  your mistake; but suffer me now to be explicit, and let me be fully, finally,  and not too late understood. You must write to me no more; I cannot answer nor  read your letters. You must speak to me no more, except in public society; you  must go further, Sir Sedley ... you must think of me no more.'  'Horrible!' cried he, starting back; 'you distress me past measure!'  'No, no, you will soon ... easily ... readily forget me.'  'Inhuman! you make me unhappy past thought!'  'Indeed I am inexpressibly concerned; but the whole affair....'  'You shock, you annihilate me, you injure me in the tenderest point!'  Camilla now, amazed, cried 'what is it you mean, sir?'  'By investing me, fair barbarian, with the temerity of forming any claim that  can call for repulse!'  Utterly confounded by so unexpected a disclaiming of all design, she again,  though from far different sensations, cast up her eyes and hands. And is it,  she thought, for a trifler such as this, so unmeaning, so unfeeling, I have  risked my whole of hope and happiness?  She said, however, no more; for what more could be said? She coloured, past  him, and hastily quitting the garden, told the footman to apologise to Mrs.  Arlbery for her sudden departure, by informing her that a near relation was  just arrived from abroad; and then got into the carriage and drove back to  Cleves. Sir Sedley followed carelessly, yet without aiming at overtaking her,  and intreated, negligently, to be heard, yet said nothing which required the  smallest answer.  Piqued completely, and mortified to the quick, by the conviction which now  broke in upon him of the superior ascendance of Mandlebert, he could not brook  to have been thought in earnest when he saw he should not have been accepted,  nor pardon his own vanity the affront it had brought upon his pride. He sung  aloud an opera air till the carriage of Sir Hugh was out of sight, and then  drove his phaeton to Clarendel-Place, where he instantly ordered his  post-chaise, and in less than an hour, set off on a tour to the Hebrides.
