 A Rage of Obliging  Camilla, from the instant she had perceived Edgar, had been in the utmost  emotion, from doubt if his journey were to seek a reconciliation, or only to  return her letters, and take a lasting farewell. Her first feeling at his sight  urged her to retire: but something of a softer nature speedily interfered,  representing, if now he should join her, what suffering might mutually be saved  by an immediate conference. She kept, therefore, her seat, looking steadily  straight down the water, and denying herself one moment's glance at anything,  or person, upon the beach: little imagining she ingrossed, herself, the  attention of all who paraded it. But, when the insinuations of the flippant  perfumer had once made her looked at, her beauty, her apparently unprotected  situation, and the account of the wager, seemed to render her an object to be  stared at without scruple.  Mrs. Mittin saw how much they were observed, but Camilla, unheeding her  remarks, listened only to hear if any footsteps approached; but when, at last,  some struck her ears, they were accompanied by an unknown voice, so loud and  clamorously jovial, that, disturbed, she looked round ... and saw the door  violently flung open, and three persons, dressed like gentlemen, force their  way into the small dwelling place.  Mr. Halder, the leader of this triumvirate, was the particular patron of Girt,  the young perfumer; and, though his superior in birth and riches, was scarcely  upon a par with him, from wilful neglect, in education; and undoubtedly beneath  him in decency and conduct, notwithstanding young Girt piqued himself far less  upon such sentimental qualifications, than upon his skill in cosmetics, and had  less respect for unadulterated morals, than unadulterated powder.  The second who entered, was, in every particular, still less defensible: he was  a peer of the realm; he had a daughter married, and his age entitled him to be  the grandfather of young Halder. In point of fortune, speculatists deemed them  equal; for though the estate of Halder was as yet unincumbered with the  mortgages that hung upon that of Lord Valhurst, they computed, with great  exactness, the term of its superiority, since already he had inlisted in the  jockey meetings, and belonged to the gaming clubs.  The third, a young man of a serious, but pleasing demeanour, was rather an  attendant than a partner in this intrusion. He was the only one of the whole  party to whom the countenance of Camilla had announced innocence; and when  Halder, instigated by the assertions of the facetious Girt, proposed the  present measure, and Lord Valhurst, caught by the youthful beauty of the fair  subject of discussion, acceded, this single champion stood forth, and modestly,  yet firmly, declaring his opinion they were mistaken, accompanied them with a  view to protect her, if he himself were right.  Boisterously entering, Halder addressed at once to Camilla, such unceremonious  praise of her beauty, that, affrighted and offended, she hastily seized the arm  of Mrs. Mittin, and, in a voice of alarm, though with an air of command that  admitted no doubt of her seriousness, and no appeal from her resolution, said,  'Let us go home, Mrs. Mittin, immediately.'  Simple as were these words, their manner had an effect upon Halder to awe and  distance him. Beauty, in the garb of virtue, is rather formidable than  attractive to those who are natively unenlightened, as well as habitually  degenerate: though, over such as have ever known better sentiments, it  frequently retains its primeval power, even in their darkest declension of  depravity.  But while Halder, repulsed, stood back, and the young champion, with an air the  most respectful, made way for her to pass; Lord Valhurst, shutting the door,  planted himself against it.  Seeing terror now take possession of every feature of her face, her determined  protector called out: 'Make way, my Lord, I beg!' and offered her his hand. But  Camilla, equally frightened at them all, shrunk appalled from his assistance,  and turned towards the window, with an intention of demanding help from Edgar,  whom she supposed still on the beach; but the peer, slowly moving from the  door, said he was the last to mean to disconcert the young lady, and only  wished to stop her till he could call for his carriage, that he might see her  safe wherever she wished to go.  Camilla had no doubt of the sincerity of this proposal, but would accept no aid  from a stranger, even though an old man, while she hoped to obtain that of  Edgar. Edgar, however, she saw not, and fear is generally precipitate: she  concluded him gone; concluded herself deserted, and, from knowing neither,  equally fearing both the young men, inclined towards Lord Valhurst; who, with  delighted surprise, was going to take her under his care, when Edgar rushed  forward.  The pleasure that darted into her eyes announced his welcome. Halder, from his  reception, thought the enigma of his own ill success solved; the other youth,  supposing him her brother, no longer sought to interfere; but Lord Valhurst  exhibited signs of such irrepressible mortification, that inexperience itself  could not mistake the dishonourable views of his offered services, since, to  see her in safety, was so evidently not their purpose. Camilla, looking at him  with the horror he so justly excited, gave her hand to Edgar, who had instantly  claimed it, and, without one word being uttered by either, hastily walked away  with him, nimbly accompanied by Mrs. Mittin.  The young man, whose own mind was sufficiently pure to make him give easy  credit to the purity of another, was shocked at his undeserved implication in  so gross an attack, and at his failure of manifesting the laudable motive which  had made him one of the triumvirate; and, looking after her with mingled  admiration and concern, 'Indeed, gentlemen,' he cried, 'you have been much to  blame. You have affronted a young lady who carries in the whole of her  appearance the marks of meriting respect.'  The sensibility of Lord Valhurst was not of sufficient magnitude to separate  into two courses: the little he possessed was already occupied by his  disappointment, in losing the beautiful prey he believed just falling into his  hands, and he had no emotion, therefore, to bestow upon his young reprover. But  Halder, who, to want of feeling, added want of sense, roared out, with rude  raillery, a gross, which he thought witty attack, both of the defender and the  defended.  The young man, with the proud probity of unhackneyed sentiment, made a  vindication of his uncorrupt intentions; which produced but louder mirth, and  coarser incredulity. The contest, however, was wholly unequal; one had nerves  of the most irritable delicacy; the other had never yet, by any sensation, nor  any accident, been admonished that nerves made any part of the human  composition: in proportion, therefore, as one became more offended, the other  grew more callous, till the chivalry of indignant honour, casting prudence,  safety, and forbearance away, dictated a hasty challenge, which was accepted  with a hoarse laugh of brutal senselessness of danger. Courage is of another  description. It risks life with heroism; but it is only to preserve or pursue  something, without which the charm of life were dissolved: it meets death with  steadiness; but it prepares for immortality with reverence and emotion.  Edgar and Camilla continued their walk in a silence painful to both, but which  neither knew how first to break; each wished with earnestness an opening to  communication and confidence; but, mutually shocked by the recent adventure,  Edgar waited the absence of Mrs. Mittin, to point out the impropriety and  insufficiency of such a guard; and Camilla, still aghast with terror, had no  power of any sort to begin a discourse.  Their taciturnity, if not well supplied, was, at least, well contrasted by the  volubility of Mrs. Mittin, which, as in the bathing house it had been  incessant, in declaring, to the three intruders, that both she and the other  young lady were persons of honour, was now no less unremitting in boasting how  well she had checked and kept them in order.  The horror of the attack she had just escaped became soon but a secondary  suffering to Camilla, though, at the moment, it had impressed her more terribly  than any actual event of her life, or any scene her creative imagination had  ever painted; yet, however dreadful, it was now past; but who could tell the  end of what remained? the mute distance of Edgar, her uncertainty of his  intentions, her suspicions of his wished secession, the severe task she thought  necessary to perform of giving him his liberty, with the anguish of a total  inability to judge whether such a step would recall his tenderness, or  precipitate his retreat, were suggestions which quickly succeeded, and, in a  very short time, wholly domineered over every other.  When they arrived at the house, Edgar demanded if he might hope for the honour  of being presented, as a friend of the family, to Mrs. Berlinton.  Reviving, though embarrassed, she looked assent, and went forward to inquire if  Mrs. Berlinton were come home.  The servant answered no; but delivered her a letter from that lady; she took it  with a look of distress whether or not to invite Edgar to enter, which the, at  this period, welcome officiousness of Mrs. Mittin relieved, by saying, 'Come,  let us all come in, and make the parlour a little comfortable against Mrs.  Berlinton comes home; for, I dare say, there's nothing as it should be. These  lodging-houses always want a heap of things one never thinks of before hand.'  They then all three entered, and Mrs. Mittin, who saw, she said, a thousand  ways by which she might serve and oblige Mrs. Berlinton, by various  suggestions, and even directions, which she hazarded against her return, busied  herself to arrange the two parlours to her satisfaction; and, then, went up  stairs, to settle, also, all there; making abundant apologies for leaving them,  and assuring them she would be back again as soon as she possibly could get all  in order.  Her departure was a moment of extreme confusion to Camilla, who considered it  as an invitation to her great scheme of rejection, but who stammered something  upon every other subject, to keep that off. She looked at her letter, wondered  what it could contain, could not imagine why Mrs. Berlinton should write when  they must so soon meet; and spent in conjectures upon its contents the time  which Edgar besought her to bestow upon their perusal.  Nothing gives so much strength to an adversary as the view of timidity in his  opponent. Edgar grew presently composed, and felt equal to his purposed  expostulation.  'You decline reading your letter till I am gone?' cried he; 'I must, therefore,  hasten away. Yet, before I go, I earnestly wish once more to take upon me the  office formerly allowed me, and to represent, with simple sincerity, my  apprehensions upon what I have observed this morning.'  The beginning of this speech had made Camilla break the seal of her letter; but  its conclusion agitated her too much for reading it.  'Is this silence,' said he, trying to smile, 'to repress me as arrogant, ... or  to disregard me as impertinent?'  'Neither!' she answered, forcing herself to look towards him with cheerfulness;  'it is merely ... attention.'  'You are very good, and I will try to be brief, that I may put your patience to  no longer proof than I can avoid. You know, already, all I can urge concerning  Mrs. Berlinton; how little I wonder at the promptness of your admiration; yet  how greatly I fear for the permanence of your esteem. In putting yourself under  her immediate and sole protection, you have shewn me the complete dissonance of  our judgments upon this subject; but I do not forget that, though you had the  goodness to hear me, you had the right to decide for yourself. Trust indeed,  even against warning, is so far more amiable than suspicion, that it must  always, even though it prove unfortunate, call for praise rather than censure.'  The confusion of Camilla was now converted into self-reproach. What she thought  coldness, she had resented; what appeared to her to be haughtiness, she had  resisted; but truth, in the form of gentleness, brought her instantly to  reason, and reason could only resume its empire, to represent as rash and  imprudent an expedition so repugnant, in its circumstances, to the wishes and  opinions of the person whose approbation was most essential to her happiness.  Edgar had paused; and her every impulse led to a candid recognition of what she  felt to be wrong; but her precarious situation with him, the report of his  intended flight by Jacob, the letters still detained of Sir Sedley Clarendel,  and no explanation demanded, by which she could gather if his plighted honour  were not now his only tie with her, curbed her design, depressed her courage,  and, silently, she let him proceed.  'Upon this subject, therefore, I must say no more, except to hint a wish, that  the apprehensions which first induced me to name it may, unbidden, occur as  timely heralds to exertion, should any untoward circumstances point to danger,  alarm, or impropriety.'  The new, but strong friendship of Camilla was alarmed for its delicacy by these  words. The diffidence she felt, from conscious error, for herself, extended not  to Mrs. Berlinton, whom, since she found guiltless, she believed to be  blameless. She broke forth, therefore, into a warm eulogy, which her agitation  rendered eloquent, while her own mind and spirits were relieved and revived, by  this flight from her mortified self, to the friend she thought deserving her  most fervent justification.  Edgar listened attentively, and his eyes, though they expressed much of serious  concern, shewed also an irrepressible admiration of an enthusiasm so ardent for  a female friend of so much beauty.  'May she always merit this generous warmth!' cried he; 'which must have excited  my best wishes for her welfare, even if I had been insensible to her own claims  upon every man of feeling. But I had meant, at this time, to confine my  ungrateful annotations to another ... to the person who had just quitted the  room.'  'You do not mean to name her with Mrs. Berlinton? to imagine it possible I can  have for her any similar regard? or any, indeed, at all, but such common  good-will as all sorts and classes of people are entitled to, who are well  meaning?'  'Here, at least, then,' said Edgar, with a sigh half suppressed, 'our opinions  may be consonant. No; I designed no such disgraceful parallel for your elegant  favourite. My whole intention is to remonstrate ... can you pardon so plain a  word?... against your appearing in public with a person so ill adapted to  insure you the respect that is so every way your due.'  'I had not the smallest idea, believe me, of appearing in public. I merely  walked out to see the town, and to beguile, in a stroll, time, which, in this  person's society, hung heavy upon me at home, in the absence of Mrs. Berlinton.'  The concise simplicity of this innocent account, banished, in a moment, all  severity of judgment; and Edgar, expressively thanking her, rose, and was  approaching her, though scarcely knowing with what purpose, when Mrs. Mittin  burst into the room, exclaiming: 'Well, my dear, you'll never guess how many  things I have done since I left you. In the first place, there was never a  wash-ball; in the next place, not a napkin nor a towel was in its proper place;  then the tea-things were forgot; and as to spoons, not one could I find. And  now, I've a mind to go myself to a shop I took good notice of, and get her a  little almond powder for her nice white hands; which, I dare say, will please  her. I've thought of a hundred things at least. I dare say I shall quite win  her heart. And I'm sure of my money again, if I lay out never so much. And I  don't know what I would not do for such a good lady.'  During this harangue, Camilla, ashamed of her want of resolution, secretly  vowed, that, if again left alone with him, she would not lose a moment in  restoring him his liberty, that with dignity she might once more receive, or  with fortitude for ever resign it. She thought herself, at this moment, capable  of either; but she had only thought it, since his softened look and air had  made her believe she had nothing to fear from the alternative.  Mrs. Mittin soon went, though her continued and unmeaning chattery made the  short term of her stay appear long.  Each eager upon their own plan, both then involuntarily arose.  Camilla spoke first. 'I have something,' she cried, 'to say, ...' but her voice  became so husky, the inarticulate sounds died away unheard, and blushing at so  feeble an opening, she strove, under the auspices of a cough, to disguise that  she had spoken at all, for the purpose of beginning, in a more striking manner,  again.  This succeeded with Edgar at this moment, for he had heard her voice, not her  words: he began, therefore, himself. 'This good lady,' he said, 'seems bit with  the rage of obliging, though not, I think, so heroically, as much to injure her  interest. But surely she flatters herself with somewhat too high a recompence?  The heart of Mrs. Berlinton is not, I fancy, framed for such a conquerer. But  how, at the same time, is it possible conversation such as this should be heard  under her roof? And how can it have come to pass that such a person....'  'Talk of her,' interrupted Camilla, recovering her breath, 'some other time.  Let me now inquire ... have you burnt ... I hope so!... those foolish ...  letters ... I put into your hands?...'  The countenance of Edgar was instantly overclouded. The mention of those  letters brought fresh to his heart the bitterest, the most excruciating and  intolerable pang it had ever experienced; it brought Camilla to his view no  longer artless, pure, and single-minded, but engaged to, or trifling with, one  man, while seriously accepting another. 'No, madam,' he solemnly said, 'I have  not presumed so far. Their answers are not likely to meet with so violent a  death, and it seemed to me that one part of the correspondence should be  preserved for the elucidation of the other.'  Camilla felt stung by this reply, and tremulously answered, 'Give me them back,  then, if you please, and I will take care to see them all demolished together,  in the same flames. Meanwhile....'  'Are you sure,' interrupted Edgar, 'such a conflagration will be permitted?  Does the man live who would have the philosophy ... the insensibility I must  rather style it—ever to resign, after once possessing, marks so  distinguishing of esteem? O, Camilla! I, at least, could not be that man!'  Cut to the soul by this question, which, though softened by the last phrase,  she deemed severely cruel, she hastily exclaimed: 'Philosophy I have no right  to speak of ... but as to insensibility ... who is the man that ever more can  surprise me by its display? Let me take, however, this opportunity....'  A footman, opening the door, said, his lady had sent to beg an answer to her  letter.  Camilla, in whom anger was momentary, but the love of justice permanent,  rejoiced at an interruption which prevented her from speaking, with pique and  displeasure, a sentence that must lose all its purpose if not uttered with  mildness. She would write, she said, immediately; and, bidding the man get her  pen and ink, went to the window to read her letter; with a formal bow of  apology to Edgar as she passed him.  'I have made you angry?' cried he, when the man was gone; 'and I hate myself to  have caused you a moment's pain. But you must feel for me, Camilla, in the  wound you have inflicted! you know not the disorder of mind produced by a  sudden, unlooked-for transition from felicity to perplexity, ... from serenity  to misery!...'  Camilla felt touched, yet continued reading, or rather rapidly repeating to  herself the words of her letter, without comprehending, or even seeking to  comprehend, the meaning of one sentence.  He found himself quite unequal to enduring her displeasure; his own, all his  cautions, all Dr. Marchmont's advice, were forgotten; and tenderly following  her, 'Have I offended,' he cried, 'past forgiveness? Is Camilla immoveable? and  is the journey from which I fondly hoped to date the renewal of every hope, the  termination of every doubt, the period of all suffering and sorrow....'  He stopt abruptly, from the entrance of the servant with pen and ink, and the  interruption was critical: it called him to his self-command: he stammered out  that he would not impede her writing; and, though in palpable confusion, took  his leave: yet, at the street-door, he gave a ticket with his name, to the  servant who attended him, for Mrs. Berlinton; and, with his best respects,  desired she might be told he should do himself the honour to endeavour to see  her in the evening.  The recollection of Edgar came too late to his aid to answer its intended  purpose. The tender avowal which had escaped him to Camilla, of the view of his  journey, had first with astonishment struck her ear, and next with quick  enchantment vibrated to her heart, which again it speedily taught to beat with  its pristine vivacity; and joy, spirit, and confidence expelled in a breath all  guests but themselves.
