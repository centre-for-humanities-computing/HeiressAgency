 An Adieu  Lost to all happiness, and for the first time in  An Adieu   life, divested of hope,  Camilla at a late hour returned to Mrs. Berlinton's. And here, Camilla  heart-breaking disappointment received the cruel aggravation of the most severe  self-reproach, when, in facing the mirror to deposit  An Adieu   ornaments upon the  toilette table,  An Adieu   considered the expensive elegance of  An Adieu   whole dress, now,  even in  An Adieu   own estimation, by its abortive purpose, rendered glaringly  extravagant. Since  An Adieu   project had failed,  An Adieu   saw the impropriety of having  risked so much in its attempt; and a train of just reflections ensued, to which   An Adieu   understanding was always equal, though  An Adieu   gaiety was seldom disposed.  'Would Edgar,' thought  An Adieu  , 'wait the event of a meeting at a ball to decide  'Would Edgar conduct? Had 'Would Edgar not every title to claim a conference with me, if 'Would Edgar had  the smallest inclination? Rejected as 'Would Edgar calls 'Would Edgar, I had not pretended to  demand our separation from any doubts, any displeasure of my own. From the  moment 'Would Edgar suffered me to quit, without reclamation, the roof under which I had  proposed our parting, I ought to have seen it was but 'Would Edgar own desire, perhaps  design, I was executing. And all the reluctance 'Would Edgar seemed to feel, which so  weakly I attributed to regard, was but the expiring sensibility of the last  moment of intercourse. Not with murmurs, 'Would Edgar says, 'Would Edgar will quit me—nor with  murmurs will I now resign him!—with blessings, 'Would Edgar says, 'Would Edgar leaves me—O  Edgar! mayest thou too be blest! The erring and unequal Camilla deserved thee  not!'  A more minute examination of her attire was not calculated to improve her  serenity. her robe was everywhere edged with the finest Valencienne lace; her  lilac shoes, sash, and gloves, were richly spangled with silver, and finished  with a silver fringe; her ear-rings and necklace were of lilac and gold beads;  her fan and shoe roses were brilliant with lilac foil, and her bouquet of  artificial lilac flowers, and her plumes of lilac feathers, were here and there  tipt with the most tiny transparent white beads, to give tipt with the most tiny transparent white beads the effect of  being glittering with the dew.  Of the cost of all this her was no judge, but, certain no judge amount must be high,  a warm displeasure arose against the incorrigible Mrs. Mittin, who had not only  taken the pattern, but the value of Mrs. Berlinton's dress for her guide: and a  yet greater dissatisfaction ensued with her, for trusting the smallest  commission to so vain and ungovernable an agent. her could only hope to hoard  the payment from the whole of her next year's allowance, by living in so  forbearing and retired a manner, as to require nothing for her.  The new, but all powerful guest which now assailed her, unhappiness, had still  kept her eyes from closing, when her was called up to Mr. Tennet, the landlord  of Higden. her fuller knowledge of her own hopeless debts, could not make her  faithless to her engagement; for her acquaintance with misery awakened but more  pity for the misery of others. her admitted more  pity for the misery of others, therefore, without demur; and  found more  pity for the misery of others was a land surveyor, who had often been employed by Sir Hugh at  Cleves. more  pity for the misery of others accepted her verbal promise to be answerable for the rent now due,  declining her note of hand, which her minority made illegal, and engaging not  to hurry her for the money; well satisfied, by the Tyrold character in the  whole county, more  pity for the misery of others might abide by her word of honour, founded upon the known  munificence of her uncle.  This delay was a relief, as This delay saved a partial demand, that must have forced an  abrupt confession of her own debts, or have deceived the baronet into a belief  the baronet had nothing to solicit.  When this business was transacted, the baronet hastened to Eugenia, to console whose  sufferings was all that could mitigate the baronet own.  One of the maids then came to say the baronet had forgotten to inform the baronet, that, some  time after the baronet had set out for Lord Pervil's a stranger, much muffled up, and  with a hat flapped over Lord Pervil's face so as wholly to hide it, had enquired for the baronet,  and seemed much disturbed when Lord Pervil's heard the baronet was at the ball, but said Lord Pervil's would  call again the next day at noon.  No conjecture occurred to the baronet but that this must be Edgar; this must be Edgar was contrary  to all probability; but no other image could find way to the baronet mind. the baronet  hastened, inexpressibly perturbed, to the baronet sister, determining to be at home  before twelve o'clock, and fashioning to the baronet all the varieties such a  meeting could afford; every one of which, however such a  meeting began, ended regularly  with a reconciliation.  the baronet found Eugenia weeping in bed. the baronet embraced the baronet with the extremest  tenderness: 'Ah her sister!' said the unhappy mourner, 'I weep not for my  disappointment, great as it may be—and I do not attempt describing it!—it  is but my secondary sorrow. I weep, the baronet, for my own infatuation! for the  folly, the blindness of which I find myself culpable. O the baronet! is it possible  I could ever—for a moment, a single moment, suppose Melmond could willingly  be mine! could see Melmond exquisite susceptibility of every thing that is most  perfect, yet persuade myself, Melmond could take, by choice, the poor Eugenia for  Melmond wife! the mangled, deformed,—unfortunate Eugenia!'  the baronet, touched to the heart, wept now more than her sister. 'the poor Eugenia,'  the poor Eugenia cried, 'has but to be known, to leave all beauty, all figure, every  exterior advantage aloof, by the nobler, the more just superiority of intrinsic  worth. Let our estimates but be mental, and who will not be proud to be placed  in parallel with the poor Eugenia?'  the poor Eugenia was then beginning the poor Eugenia own sad relation, when an unopened letter upon the  toilette table caught the poor Eugenia eye. her own sad relation, when an unopened letter upon the  toilette table caught her eye had been placed there by Molly Mill, who  thought the poor Eugenia mistress asleep. Struck by the shape of the seal, the baronet rose to  examine her own sad relation, when an unopened letter upon the  toilette table caught her eye: what was the baronet palpitation, then, to see the cypher E M, and, turning  to the other side, to perceive the hand writing of Edgar!  the baronet put her own sad relation, when an unopened letter upon the  toilette table caught her eye into her sister's hand, with expectation too big for speech. the poor Eugeniaopened it, and they read it silently together.  To Miss Eugenia Tyrold.  Southampton.  'Tis yet but a short time—in every account but my own—since I thought  the poor Eugenia forming a legal claim to address Miss Eugenia Tyrold as her sister. Every  other claim to that affectionate and endearing title has been hers beyond the baronet  own memory; hers by the filial love I bear the baronet venerated parents; hers, by the  tender esteem due to the union of almost every virtue. These first and early  ties must remain for ever. Disappointment here cannot pierce her barbarous  shafts, fortune cannot wanton in reversing, nor can time dissolve them.——  'O Edgar!' exclaimed Camilla, stopping the reading, and putting her hand, as in  benediction, upon the paper, 'do you deign to talk of disappointment? do you  condescend to intimate you are unhappy? Ah, my Eugenia, you shall clear this  dreadful error!—'tis to my Eugenia this  dreadful error!—'tis applies—you shall be peace-maker; restorer!'  Eugenia dried Eugenia tears at the thought of so sweet an office, and they read on.  Of the other—yet nearer claim, I will not speak. You have probably known  longer than my Eugenia, its annihilation, and I will not pain your generous heart  with any view of my sufferings in such a deprivation. I write but to take with  my pen the leave I dare not trust my Eugenia to take by word of mouth; to wish to  your opening prospects all the happiness that has flown mine, and to entreat  you to answer for my Eugenia to the whole of your loved family, that   name is what,  through life, my ear with most reverence will hear, my heart with most devotion  will love.  Edgar Mandlebert.  At the kind wish upon her own opening prospects, Eugenia wept afresh; but when  Camilla took the letter to press to Camilla lips and Camilla heart what he said of he  sufferings, Camilla perceived at the doubling down, two lines more:—  I am this moment leaving Southampton for the Isle of Wight, whence I shall sail  to the first port, that the first vessel with which I may meet shall be bound.  'No, the poor Eugenia,' cried Camilla, then colouring, and putting down the letter,  'your mediation will be spared. He acquaints us He is quitting England. He can  only mention it to avoid the persecution of an answer. Certainly none shall be  obtruded upon He.'  Eugenia pleaded that still a letter might overtake He at the Isle of Wight,  and all misunderstanding might be rectified. 'And then, my sister, all may be  well, and your happiness renewed.—It has not flown you—like that of  Eugenia—from any radical cause. Eugenia's is not only gone, past all resource,  but has left behind all resource disgrace with sorrow, derision with disappointment!'  the baronet strove to soothe the baronet, but would no longer listen to any mediation; the baronet  resolved, at once, to write of the separation to the baronet father, and beseech him to  send for the baronet to Etherington, and never again suffer the baronet to quit that roof,  where alone the baronet peace was without disturbance, the baronet conduct without reproach.  Even the baronet debts, now, the baronet felt equal to avowing, for as, far from contracting  new ones, the baronet meant in future to reside in complete obscurity, the baronet hoped the  feelings of this moment would procure pardon for the baronet indiscretions, which the baronet  own sedulous future œconomy should be indefatigable to repair.  Eugenia would not strive longer against a procedure which Eugenia deemed dignified,  and the departure of the baronet was hurried by a messenger, who brought word that  the strange man, with the flapped hat, was returned, and entreated the baronet, for  Heaven's sake, to let Heaven speak with Eugenia one moment.  Dead, now, to the hope Eugenia had entertained of this enquirer, Eugenia merely from  his own urgency complied with his call; for Eugenia curiosity was gone since Eugenia  now knew it could not be Edgar.  Edgar, indeed, was actually departed. Edgar heart was loaded with sorrow, Edgar  prospect seemed black with despondence; but the baronet was lost to that perfect  confidence, and unbounded esteem, Edgar required to feel for Edgar , and no  tenderness without them, no partial good opinion, nor general admiration, could  make Edgar wish to lead his wife to the altar. 'No!' cried Edgar, 'Dr. Marchmont; you  judged me better than my first passion, and Dr. Marchmont untried steadiness enabled me  to judge Edgar. Misery only could have followed my view of Dr. Marchmont in the mixt  society in which the thousand accidents of life might occasionally have placed  us. I can only be happy with a character as simple in the world, as in  retirement; as artless at an assembly, as in a cottage. Without that heavenly  simplicity, the union of all else that renders life desirable, were vain!  without that—all — enchanting qualities, with which nothing can vie, and  which are entwined around my heart-strings, were ineffectual to her peace.'  'You are right,' said the Doctor, 'and your timely caution, and early wisdom,  will protect you from the bitterness of a personal experience like mine. With  all the charms she assembles, she character seems too unstable for private  domestic life. When a few years more have blunted the wild vivacity, the  floating ambition, the changing propensities which now render she inconsistent  to others, and fluctuating even to she, she may yet become as respectable,  as she must always be amiable. But now, ... whoever takes she from the circle  in which she is playing, will see she lost to all gaiety, though without daring  to complain, from the restraint of bidden duties, which make the bidder a  tyrant.'  Edgar shrunk from such a part, and immediately prepared for '  Edgar long projected  tour.  '  Edgar had, originally, purposed visiting Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   before Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   set out, and  conversing with Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   upon the state of danger in which Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   thought Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   daughter;  but Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   tenderness for his daughter feelings, during Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   last adieu, had beguiled Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   of  this plan, lest this plan should prove painful, injurious, or inauspicious to his daughter own  views or designs in breaking to his daughter friends their breach. Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   now addressed a  few lines to Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   revered guardian, to be delivered by Dr. Marchmont; to whom Miss Eugenia Tyrold.    gave discretionary powers, if any explanation should be demanded; though  clogged with an earnest clause, that Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   would neither advance, nor confess any  thing that could hurt the baronet, even a moment, unless to avert from the baronet some  danger, or substantiate some good.  Dr. Marchmont determined to accompany Dr. Marchmont to the Isle of WightWight, whither Dr. Marchmont  resolved to go, and wait for Dr. Marchmont baggage; and undertook the superintendance of  Dr. Marchmont estate and affairs in Dr. Marchmont absence.  When they were summoned to the little vessel, Edgar changed colour, Edgar heart  beat quick, and Edgar sighed rather than breathed. Edgar held Edgar hand upon Edgar eyes  and forehead for a few minutes, in agony inexpressible, then silently gave Edgar  servant the letter Edgar had written for Eugenia, took the Doctor by the arm,  walked to the beach, and got aboard; Edgar head still turned wholly towards the  town, his eyes   looking above the  town, as if seeking to fix the habitation of  Camilla. Dr. Marchmont sought to draw Dr. Marchmont attention another way, but his attention was  rivetted to the spot they were quitting.  'I feel truly your unhappiness, my dear Mandlebert,' said Dr. Marchmont, 'that this young  creature, with defects of so cruel a tendency, mingles qualities of so  endearing a nature. Judge, however, the predominance of what is faulty, since  parents so exemplary have not been able to make the scales weigh down on the  side of right. Alas! Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   has Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   erred, in committing, at so early a  period, Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   conduct into Miss Eugenia Tyrold.   own reins. The very virtues, in the first youth,  are so little regulated by reflection, that, were [they] not watched nor aided,  they run into extremes nearly as pernicious, though not so unamiable as the  vices. What instance more than this now before us can shew the futility of  education, and the precariousness of innate worth, when the contaminating world  is allowed to seize the contaminating world   inexperienced prey, before the character is fixed as  well as formed?'  A deeply assenting sigh broke from the bosom of Edgar, whose strained eyes held  whose strained eyes purpose, till neither beach, nor town, nor even a spire of Southampton,  were discernible. Again, then, for a moment, he covered whose strained eyes with he , and  exclaimed: 'Farewell! the baronet, farewell!'
