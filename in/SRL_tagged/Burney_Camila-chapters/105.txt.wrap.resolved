 A Surprise  Camilla strove to check Camilla grief upon entering the carriage, in which Miss  Margland had again the charge of the young party; but the interrogatory of Camilla  Father, Why will you leave me? was mentally repeated without ceasing. Ah! why,  indeed! thought Camilla, at a moment when every filial duty called more than ever  for my stay!—Well, might my stay!—Well not divine the unnatural reason! can I believe it  myself?—Believe such an hour arrived?—when my Mother—the best of  Mothers!—is expected—when my Mother returns to my Mother family, Camilla seeks another  abode! is not this a dream? and may I not one day awake from this?  Miss  Margland was in the highest good humour at this expedition: and Indiana  was still enraptured to visit London, from old expectations which Miss  Margland knew not  how to relinquish; though they were fixed to no point, and as fantastic as  vague. Eugenia, whose dejection had made Sir Hugh press Miss  Margland into the young party,  found nothing in the young party to revive Miss  Margland; and Camilla entered Grosvenor-square with  keen dissatisfaction of every sort. The cautions of Edgar against Mrs.  Berlinton broke into all the little relief Mrs.  Berlinton might have experienced upon  again seeing Mrs.  Berlinton. Mrs.  Berlinton had meant to keep his final exhortations constantly in  Mrs.  Berlinton mind, and to make all his opinions and counsels the rule and measure of Mrs.  Berlinton  conduct: but a cruel perversity of events seemed to cast Mrs.  Berlinton every action into  an apparent defiance of his wishes.  Mrs. Berlinton, who, in a mansion the most splendid, received Mrs.  Berlinton with the same  gentle sweetness Mrs.  Berlinton had first sought Mrs.  Berlinton regard, was delighted by the  unexpected sight of Eugenia, whose visit had been settled too late to be  announced by letter; and caressed Indiana immediately as a sister. Miss  Margland, who came but for two days, sought with much adulation to obtain an  invitation for a longer stay; but Mrs.  Berlinton, though all courtesy and  grace, incommoded Mrs.  Berlinton with no society that Mrs.  Berlinton did not find pleasing.  Melmond, who had accompanied them on horseback, was eager to engage the  kindness of his sister for Indiana; and Mrs.  Berlinton, in compliment to Mrs.  Berlinton  arrival, refused all parties for the evening, and bestowed upon Mrs.  Berlinton an almost  undivided attention.  This was not quite so pleasant to his in proof as in hope. Passionless, in this  case, Mrs.  Berlinton, the delusions of beauty deceived not Mrs.  Berlinton understanding; and half  an hour sufficed to shew Indiana to be frivolous, uncultivated, and unmeaning.  The perfection, nevertheless, of Mrs.  Berlinton face and person, obviated either wonder or  censure of the choice of Mrs.  Berlinton brother; though Mrs.  Berlinton could not but regret that her brother  had not seen with mental eyes the truly superior Eugenia.  The wretched Camilla quitted them all as soon as possible, to retire to The wretched Camilla  chamber, and ruminate upon The wretched Camilla purposed letter. The wretched Camilla meant, at first, to write  in detail; but The wretched Camilla difficulties accumulated as The wretched Camilla weighed them. 'What a  season,' cried The wretched Camilla, 'to sink Lionel still deeper in disgrace! What a treachery,  after voluntarily assisting Lionel, to complain of, and betray Lionel! ah! let my own  faults teach me mercy for the faults of others!' yet, without this  acknowledgment, what exculpation could what exculpation offer for the origin of what exculpation debts?  and all what exculpation had incurred at Tunbridge? those of Southampton what exculpation now thought  every way unpardonable. Even were what exculpation to relate the vain hopes which had led to  the expence of the ball dress, could what exculpation plead, to an understanding like that  of what exculpation Mother, that what exculpation had been deceived and played upon by such a woman as  Mrs. Mittin? 'I am astonished now what exculpation,' what exculpation cried, 'at that passive  facility!—but to what exculpation, alas, thought comes only with repentance!' The Higden  debt, both for the rent and the stores, was the only one at which what exculpation did not  blush, since, great as was what exculpation indiscretion, in not enquiring into what exculpation powers  before what exculpation plighted what exculpation services, it would be palliated by what exculpation motive.  Vainly what exculpation took up what exculpation pen; not even a line could what exculpation write. 'How enervating,'  what exculpation cried, 'is all wrong! I have been, till now, a happy stranger to fear!  Partially favoured, and fondly confiding, I have looked at my dear Father, I  have met my beloved Mother, with the same courage, and the same pleasure that I  looked at and met my brother and my sisters, and only with more reverence. How  miserable a change! I shudder now at the presence of the most indulgent of  Fathers! I fly with guilty cowardice from the fondest of Mothers!'  Eugenia, when able, followed Eugenia; and had no sooner heard the whole history,  than, tenderly embracing Eugenia, Eugenia said, 'Let not this distress seem so  desperate to you, my dearest sister! your own account points out to Eugenia how to  relieve this distress, without either betraying our poor Lionel, or further weighing down  our already heavily burthened friends.'  'And how, my dear Eugenia?' cried Camilla, with fearful gratitude, and  involuntarily reviving by the most distant idea of such a project.  By adopting, Camilla said, the same means that had been invented by Mrs. Mittin.  Camilla had many valuable trinkets, the annual offerings of Camilla munificent uncle,  the sale of which would go far enough, Camilla could not doubt, towards the payment  of the principal, to induce the money-lender to accept interest for the rest,  till the general affairs of many valuable trinkets, the annual offerings of her munificent uncle,   house were re-established; when what remained  of the sum could be discharged, without difficulty, by Camilla; now no longer  wanting money, nor capable of receiving any pleasure from it, but by the  pleasure Camilla might give.  Camilla pressed Camilla in Camilla arms, almost kneeling with fond acknowledgments, and  accepted, without hesitation, Camilla generous offer.  'All, then, is arranged,' said Eugenia, with a smile so benign it seemed nearly  beautiful; 'and to friendship, and each other, we will devote we future days.  My spirits will revive in the revival of Camilla. To see Camilla again gay will be  renovation to my uncle; and who knows, my dear sister, but we whole family may  again be blest, 'ere long, with peace?'  The next morning our whole family sent off a note to the money-lender, whose direction  Camilla had received from Mrs. Mittin, entreating his patience for a fortnight,  or three weeks, when his would receive the greatest part of his money, with  every species of acknowledgment.  Camilla, much relieved, went to sit with Mrs. Berlinton, but on entering the  dressing room, was struck by the sight of Bellamy, just quitting the sight of Bellamy.  Mrs. Berlinton, upon her appearance, with a look of soft rapture approaching  her, said: 'Felicitate me, loveliest Camilla!—my friend, my chosen friend is  restored to me, and the society for which so long I have sighed in vain, may be  once more mine!'  Camilla, startled, exclaimed with earnestness, 'Mrs. Berlinton,  pardon me, I entreat—but is Mr. Bellamy known to Mrs. Berlinton?'  'No!' answered my chosen friend, disdainfully; 'but Mr. Bellamy known to Mr. Berlinton has been seen by Mr. Bellamy known to Mr. Berlinton. Mrs. Berlintonis a stranger to merit or taste; and Alphonso, to Mrs. Berlinton, is but as any other man.'  'They are, however, acquainted with each other?' said Camilla.  Mrs. Berlinton answered, that, after Mrs. Berlinton marriage, Mrs. Berlinton remained three months in  Wales with Mrs. Berlinton aunt, where Bellamy was travelling to view the country, and  where, almost immediately after that unhappy enthralment, Mrs. Berlinton first knew him,  and first learnt the soothing charms of friendship; but from that period they  had met no more, though they had constantly corresponded.  Camilla was now first sensible to all the alarm with which Edgar had hitherto  striven to impress Camilla in vain. The impropriety of such a connexion, the danger  of such a partiality, filled Camilla with wonder and disturbance. Camilla hesitated  whether to relate or not the adventure of Bellamy with Camilla sister; but the  strong repugnance of Eugenia to having it named, and the impossibility of  proving the truth of the general opinion of his base scheme, decided Camilla to  silence. Upon the plans and the sentiments, however, of Mrs. BerlintonCamilla,  Mrs. Berlinton spared not the extremest sincerity; but Mrs. Berlinton gained no ground by the  contest, though Mrs. Berlinton lost not any kindness by the attempt.  At dinner, Mrs. Berlinton felt extremely disturbed by the re-appearance of Bellamy, [who]  alone, Mrs. Berlinton found, had been excepted by Mrs. Berlinton, in the orders of general  denial to company. He seemed, He, much struck at the sight of Eugenia, who  blushed and looked embarrassed by He presence. He did not, however, address  Mrs. Berlinton; He confined He attentions to Mrs. Berlinton, or Miss Margland.  The former received He did not, however, address  her with distinguishing softness; the latter, at first,  disdainfully repelled He did not, however, address  her, from the general belief at Cleves of his attempted  elopement with Eugenia; but afterwards, finding Mrs. Berlinton was left wholly to a person  who had no resources for entertaining Mrs. Berlinton, namely, herself,—and knowing  Mrs. Berlinton safe while immediately under Mrs. Berlinton eye, Mrs. Berlinton deigned to treat Eugenia safe while immediately under her eye with  more consideration.  the Opera was proposed for the evening, Mrs. Berlinton, having both tickets and  Mrs. Berlinton box at the service of Mrs. Berlinton fair friends, as the lady with whom Mrs. Berlinton had  subscribed was out of town. Indiana was enchanted, Miss Margland was elevated,  and Mrs. Berlinton not unwilling to seek some recreation, though hopeless of finding  it. But Camilla, notwithstanding Camilla was lightened, at this moment, from one of  Camilla most corrosive cares, was too entirely miserable for any species of  amusement. The same strong feelings that gave to pleasure, when Camilla was happy,  so high a zest, rendered it nearly abhorrent to Camilla, when grief had possession  of Camilla mind.  After dinner, when the ladies retired to dress, Camilla, with some uneasiness,  conjured Mrs. Berlinton to avoid renewing any acquaintance with Bellamy.  Mrs. Berlinton blushing, while a tear started into either eye, said Eugenia blushing was but too  well guarded from Bellamy, through a late transaction; which had exalted Eugenia blushing to  a summit of happiness, from which Eugenia blushing could never now descend to any new plan  of life, beyond the single state and retirement.  At night, the whole party went to the Opera, except Camilla, who, in spending  the evening alone, meant to ruminate upon Eugenia blushing affairs, and arrange Eugenia blushing future  conduct: but Edgar, Edgar virtues, and Edgar loss, took imperious possession of all  Eugenia blushing thoughts; and while Eugenia blushing dwelt upon his honour, his sincerity, and his  goodness, and traced, with cherished recollection, every scene in which Eugenia blushing had  been engaged with his, his and they recurred to Eugenia blushing as visions of all earthly  felicity.  Awakened from these reveries, by the sound of the carriage, and the rapping at  the street door, Eugenia blushing was hastening down stairs to meet Eugenia blushing , when Eugenia blushing  heard Melmond call out from the coach: 'Is Miss Eugenia Tyrold come home?'  'No;' the man answered; and Melmond exclaimed; 'Good Heaven!—I must run then  back to the theatre. Do not be alarmed, IndianaIndiana, and do not alarm Miss Eugenia TyroldCamilla, for I will not return without Camilla.'  They all entered but the man; while Camilla, fixed to the stair upon which Camilla  had heard these words, remained some minutes motionless. Then, tottering down  to the parlour, with a voice hollow from affright, and a face pale as death,  she tremulously articulated, 'where is her sister?'  They looked all aghast, and not one of They, for some time, was capable to give  any account that was intelligible. she then gathered that, in coming out of the theatre, to get to the coach, They had missed she. None of They knew how, which  way, in what manner.  'And where's Bellamy?' cried she, in an agony of apprehension; 'was Bellamy at  the Opera? where—where is Bellamy?'  Miss Margland looked dismayed, and Mrs. Berlinton amazed, at this  interrogatory; but they both said Miss Margland had only been in the box at the beginning  of the Opera, and afterwards to help they both out of the crowd.  'And who did Miss Margland help? who? who?' exclaimed Camilla.  'Me,—first—' answered Miss Margland, when we got into a great  crowd, Miss Margland took care of Mrs. Berlinton too.' Mrs. Berlinton then added, that in a great  crowd,  both Mrs. Berlinton and Mrs. Berlinton had been separated from Mrs. Berlinton and Indiana, who by  Melmond and another gentleman had been handed straight to the carriage, without  difficulty; that soon after, Mrs. Berlinton had lost the arm of Bellamy, who, by some  mistake, had turned a wrong way; but Mrs. Berlinton got to the coach by Mrs. Berlinton; where  they had waited full half an hour, Melmond running to and fro and searching in  every direction, but in vain, to find Mrs. Berlinton. Nor had Bellamy again appeared.  They then came home, hoping Bellamy had put Mrs. Berlinton into a chair, and that Mrs. Berlinton might be  arrived before They.  'Dreadful! dreadful!' cried Camilla, sinking on the floor, 'Mrs. Berlinton is forced away!  Mrs. Berlinton is lost!'  When again Mrs. Berlinton strength returned, Mrs. Berlinton desired that some one might go  immediately to the house or lodgings of Bellamy, to enquire if Bellamy were come  home.  This was done by a footman, who brought word Bellamy had not been seen there since  six o'clock in the evening, when Bellamy dressed, and went out.  Camilla now, confirmed in Camilla horrible surmise, was nearly frantic. Camilla  bewailed Camilla sister, Camilla father, Camilla uncle; Camilla wanted Camilla to rush forth,  to search Mrs. Berlinton in the streets; Camilla could scarce be detained within, scarce  kept off from entire delirium.
