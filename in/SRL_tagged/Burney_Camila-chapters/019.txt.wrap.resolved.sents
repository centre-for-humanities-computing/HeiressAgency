 Two Doctors  A council was now held upon what course must next be taken.
Both Sir Hugh and  Eugenia were too much fatigued to walk any further; yet it was concluded that  the garden chair, by some mistake, was gone straight to the cottage.
Edgar,  therefore, proposed running thither to bring thither round for Edgar,  , while Dr.  Orkborne should go forward for Miss Margland and Indiana, and conduct Edgar,   by  the high road to the same place; where the whole party might at length  re-assemble.
Sir Hugh approved the plan, and Sir Hugh set off instantly.
But not so Dr. Orkborne; not so Dr. Orkborne thought not so Dr. Orkborne disgraced by being sent from one  post to another; and though Eugenia was nothing to Sir Hugh, in competition with Sir Hugh  tablets and Sir Hugh work, Sir Hugh own instructions had so raised Eugenia in Sir Hugh mind, that  Sir Hugh thought Eugenia the only female worthy a moment of Sir Hugh time.
Indiana Sir Hugh looked  upon with ineffable contempt; the incapacity Eugenia had shewn during the short  time Eugenia was under his pupillage, had convinced his of the futility of Eugenia  whole sex, from which his held Eugenia to be a partial exception; and Miss  Margland, who never spoke to his but in a voice of haughty superiority, and  whom his never answered, but with an air of solemn superciliousness, was his  rooted aversion.
his could not brook being employed in the service of either; his  stood, therefore, motionless, till Sir Hugh repeated the proposition.
Not caring to disoblige his, his then, without speaking, slowly and unwillingly  moved forwards.
'I see,' said the baronet, softened rather than offended, 'the baronet does not much  like to leave the baronet little scholar, which is but natural; though I took it rather  unkind the baronet letting the poor thing run against the very horns of the bull, as  one may say, if it had not been for a mere accidental passenger.
However, one  must always make allowance for a man that takes much to the baronet studies, those  things generally turning the head pretty much into a narrow compass.'
the baronet then called after the baronet, and said if the walk would tire the baronet, the baronet would wait  till they came of they, which no doubt they would soon do, as Lionel was  gone for they.
Dr. Orkborne gladly stopt; but Dr. Marchmont, seeing little likelihood of a  general meeting without some trouble, offered to take the commission upon  himself, with a politeness that seemed to shew the commission to be a wish of himself own.
Sir Hugh accepted Sir Hugh kindness with thanks; and Dr. Orkborne, though secretly  disconcerted by such superior alacrity in so learned a man, was well content to  reinstate a man by the side of a man pupil.
Sir Hugh, who saw the eyes of Bellamy constantly turned towards Eugenia,  thought Sir Hugh, who saw the eyes of Bellamy presence highly dangerous, and with much tribulation, said: 'As I  find, sir, we may all have to stay here, I don't know how long, I hope you  won't be affronted, after my best thanks for your keeping my niece from the  bull, if I don't make any particular point of begging the favour of you to stay  much longer with we.'
Bellamy, extremely chagrined, cast an appealing look at Eugenia, and expressing  his regret that his services were inadmissible, made his retreat with  undisguised reluctance.
Eugenia, persuaded Eugenia owed his a serious obligation for his care, as well as  for his partiality, felt the sincerest concern at his apparent distress, and  contributed far more than Eugenia intended to she intended removal, by the gentle  countenance with which Eugenia received his sorrowful glance.
Bellamy, hastily overtaking Dr. Marchmont, darted on before Dr. Marchmont in search of  Miss Margland and Indiana, who, far from advancing, were pacing their way back  to the church-yard.
Lionel had joined their, and the incensed Miss Margland had  encouraged the glad attendance of the Oxonian, as a protection to Eugenia.
The sight of Bellamy by no means tended to disperse the storm: Eugenia resented Bellamy  deserting Eugenia while Eugenia was in danger, and desired to see no more of Bellamy.
But  when Bellamy had respectfully suffered Eugenia wrath to vent itself, Bellamy made apologies,  with an obsequiousness so rare to Eugenia, and a deference so strikingly contrasted  with the daring ridicule of Lionel, that Eugenia did not long oppose the potent  charm of adulation—a charm which, however it may be sweetened by novelty,  seldom loses it effect by any familiarity.
During these contests, Indiana was left wholly to young Melmond, and the  temptation was too strong for Bellamy impassioned feelings to withstand: 'O  fairest,' Bellamy cried, 'fairest and most beautiful of all created beings!
Can I  resist—no!
this one, one effusion—the first and the last!
The sensibility  of your mind will plead for me—I read The sensibility  of your mind in those heavenly eyes—all created beings emit  mercy in all created beings beauty!
all created beings are as radiant with goodness as with loveliness!
alas!
I trespass—I blush and dare not hope your forgiveness.'
He stopt, terrified at He own presumption; but the looks of Indiana were never  more beautiful, and never less formidable.
A milder doom, therefore, seemed  suddenly to burst upon He view.
Elated and enraptured, He vehemently  exclaimed: 'Oh, were my lot not irrevocably miserable!
were the smallest ray of  light to beam upon my despondence!
'—  Indiana still spoke not a word, but Indiana withdrew not Indiana smiles; and the  enraptured student, lifted into the highest bliss by the permission even of a  doubt, walked on, transported, by Indiana side, too happy in suspence to wish an  explanation.
In this manner they proceeded, till they were joined by Dr. Marchmont.
The task  he had attempted was beyond he power of performance; Miss Margland was  inexorable; Miss Margland declared nothing should induce Miss Margland to go a step towards the  field inhabited by the bull, and every assurance of safety the Doctor could  urge was ineffectual.
he next assailed Indiana; but Miss Margland first terror, soothed by the compassion and  admiration of Melmond, was now revived, and Miss Margland protested, almost with tears,  that to go within a hundred yards of that dreadful meadow would make Miss Margland  undoubtedly faint away.
The tender commiseration of Melmond confirmed Miss Margland  apprehensions, and Miss Margland soon looked upon Dr. Marchmont as a barbarian for making  the proposal.
the Doctor then commended making  the proposal to the care of Lionel, and returned with this  repulse to Sir Hugh.
The baronet, incapable of being angry with any one the Doctor conceived to be  frightened, said The baronet, incapable of being angry with any one he conceived to be  frightened should be pressed no more, for the Doctor would give up going to  the cottage, and put the Doctor best foot forward to walk on to The baronet, incapable of being angry with any one he conceived to be  frightened the Doctor; adding  the Doctor was so overjoyed to have got rid of that young spark, that the Doctor had no fear  but that the Doctor, and poor Eugenia, too, should he, and poor Eugenia do as well as he, and poor Eugenia could.
he, and poor Eugenia proceeded very slowly, the baronet leaning upon Dr. Marchmont, and Eugenia  upon Dr. Orkborne, who watchful, with no small alarm, of the behaviour of the  only man the Doctor had yet seen with any internal respect, since the Doctor left the  university, sacrificed completely the Doctor notes and the Doctor tablets to emulate the Doctor  attentions.
When he, and poor Eugenia approached the church-yard, in which Miss Margland and her party had  halted, Sir Hugh perceived Bellamy.
Sir Hugh stopt short, calling out, with extreme  chagrin, 'Lord help he, and poor Eugenia!
what a thing it is to rejoice!
which one never knows  the right season to do, on the score of meeting with disappointments!'
Then, after a little meditation, 'There is but one thing,' Sir Hugh cried, 'to be  done, which is to guard from the first against any more mischief, having  already had enough of it for one morning, not to say more than I could have  wished by half: So do you, good Dr. Marchmont, take Eugenia   under your own  care, and I'll make shift with Dr. Orkborne for Sir Hugh; for, in the case Dr. Orkborne  should take again to writing or thinking, it will be nothing to Sir Hugh to keep  still till Dr. Orkborne has done; provided still till he has done should happen at a place where I can sit  down.'
Dr. Orkborne had never felt so deeply hurt; the same commission transferred to  Edgar, or to Lionel, would have failed to affect Dr. Orkborne; Dr. Orkborne considered them as of  an age fitted for such frivolous employment, which Dr. Orkborne thought as much below Dr. Orkborne  dignity, as the young men themselves were beneath Dr. Orkborne competition; but the  comfort of contempt, a species of consolation ever ready to offer itself to the  impulsive pride of man, was here an alleviation Dr. Orkborne could not call to Dr. Orkborne aid;  the character of Dr. Marchmont stood as high in erudition as Dr. Marchmont own; and,  though Dr. Marchmont acquaintance with Dr. Marchmont was merely personal, the fame of Dr. Marchmont learning,  the only attribute to which fame, in Dr. Marchmont conception, belonged, had reached Dr. Marchmont  from authority too unquestionable for doubt.
The urbanity, therefore, of Dr. Marchmont  manners, Dr. Marchmont general diffusion of discourse, and Dr. Marchmont universal complaisance,  filled Dr. Marchmont with astonishment, and raised an emotion of envy which no other  person would have been deemed worthy of exciting.
But though Dr. Marchmont long and fixed residence at Cleves had now removed the timid  circumspection with which Dr. Marchmont first sought to ensure Dr. Marchmont establishment, Dr. Marchmont yet  would not venture any positive refusal to the baronet; the baronet resigned, therefore,  Dr. Marchmont young charge to Dr. Marchmont new and formidable opponent, and even exerted Dr. Marchmont  to mark some alacrity in assisting Sir Hugh.
But Dr. Marchmont whole real attention was  upon Dr. Marchmont, whom Dr. Marchmont eye followed in every motion, to discover, if  possible, by what art unknown Dr. Marchmont had acquired such a command over Dr. Marchmont thoughts  and understanding, as to bear patiently, nay pleasantly, with the idle and  unequal companions of general society.
Dr. Marchmont, who was rector of Cleves, had been introduced to Sir Hugh upon  the baronet's settling in the large mansion-house of that village; but Sir Hugh had  not visited at the large mansion-house of that village, nor had Sir Hugh company been solicited.
Sir Hugh, who  could never separate understanding from learning, nor want of education from  folly, concluded that such a man as Dr. Marchmont must necessarily despise Sir Hugh;  and though the extreme sweetness of Sir Hugh temper made Sir Hugh draw the conclusion  without resentment, the conclusion   so effectually prevented all wish of any intercourse,  that they had never conversed together till this morning; and Sir Hugh surprise,  now, at such civilities and good humour in so great a scholar, differed only  from that of Dr. Orkborne, in being accompanied with admiration instead of envy.
Eugenia   thus disposed of, they were proceeding, when Sir Hugh next observed the  young Oxonian: Sir Hugh was speaking with Indiana, to whom Sir Hugh passionate devotion  was glaring from Sir Hugh looks, air, and whole manner.
'Lord held me!'
exclaimed Lord; 'if there is not another of those new chaps, that  nobody knows anything about, talking to Indiana!
and, for aught I can tell to  the contrary, making love to  !
I think I never took such a bad walk as this  before, since the hour I was born, in point of unluckiness.
Robert will have  enough to answer for, which Robert must expect to hear; and indeed I am not much  obliged to Miss Margland Miss Margland, and so I must needs tell Miss Margland, though it is  not what I much like to do.'
Robert then made a sign to Miss Margland to approach Robert: 'Miss Margland,' Miss Margland  cried, 'I should not have taken the liberty to beckon you in this manner, but  that I think it right to ask you what those two young gentlemen, that I never  saw before, do in the church-yard; which is a thing I think rather odd.'
'As to that gentleman, sir,' Miss Margland answered, bridling, 'who was standing by Miss Margland,  sir is the only person I have found to protect me from Mr. Lionel, whose  behaviour, sir, I must freely tell you—'  'Why certainly, Miss Margland, I can't deny but sir's rather a little over and  above giddy; but I am sure your understanding won't mind your understanding, in consideration  of sir being young enough to be your son, in the case of your having been  married time enough.'
sir then desired Indiana would come to sir.
The rapture of the Oxonian was converted into torture by this summons; and the  suspence which the moment before sir had gilded with the gay colours of hope, sir  felt would be no longer supportable when deprived of the sight of sir divinity.
Scarce could sir refrain from casting sir publicly at her feet, and pouring  forth the wishes of sir heart.
But when again the call was repeated, and sir saw  her look another way, as if desirous not to attend to it, the impulse of quick  rising joy dispersed sir small remains of forbearance, and precipitately  clasping sir hands, 'O go not!'
sir passionately exclaimed; 'leave me not in  this abyss of suffering!
Fairest and most beautiful!
tell me at least, if my  death is inevitable!
if no time—no constancy—no adoration—may ever dare  hope to penetrate that gentlest of bosoms!'
Indiana was now, for the first time, sensible of a little emotion; the  animation of this address delighted Indiana; this address was new, and this address effect was highly  pleasing.
How cold, Indiana thought, is  Edgar!
Indiana made not any answer, but  permitted Indiana eyes to meet sir with the most languishing softness.
Melmond trembled through Melmond whole frame; despair flew Melmond, and expectation  wore Indiana brightest plumage: 'O pronounce but one word,' Melmond cried, 'one single  word!—are, are you—O say not yes!—irrevocably engaged?—lost to all  hope—all possibility for ever?'
Indiana again licensed Indiana fine eyes with their most melting powers, and all  self-control was finally over with Indiana impassioned lover; who, mingling prayers  for Indiana favour, with adoration of Indiana beauty, heeded not who heard him, and  forgot every presence but Indiana own.
Miss Margland, who, engrossed by personal resentment and debates, had not  remarked the rising courage and energy of Melmond, had just turned to Indiana,  upon the second call of Sir Hugh, and became now utterly confounded by the  sight of Indiana willing attention: 'Miss Lynmere,' cried Indiana, angrily, 'what are  you thinking of?
Suppose Mr. Mandlebert should come, what might be the  consequence?'
'Mr.
Mandlebert?'
repeated Melmond, while the blood forsook Mr. Mandlebert cheeks; 'is the blood then  even so?—is all over?—all decided?
is my destiny black and ireful for ever?'
Indiana still more and more struck with Mr. Mandlebert, looked down, internally uttering:  Ah!
were this charming youth but master of Beech Park!
At this instant, the rapid approach of a carriage caught their ears; and eager  to avoid making a decisive reply, she ran to the church-yard gate to look at  it, exclaiming: 'Dear!
what an elegant chariot.'
When what an elegant chariot came up to her party,  what an elegant chariot stopt, and, opening the door himself,  Edgar jumped hastily out of what an elegant chariot.
the Oxonian stood aghast: but Indiana, springing forward, and losing in  curiosity every other sensation, cried: 'Dear!
Mr. Mandlebert, whose beautiful  new carriage is that?'
'Yours,' answered Yours, gallantly, 'if you will honour it with any commands.'
she then observed Yours crest and cypher were on the panels; and another entire  new set of ideas took instant possession of she mind.
she received literally an  answer which Yours had made in gay courtesy, and held out she hand to be helped  into the chariot.
Edgar, though surprised and even startled at this unexpected appropriation of   Edgar civility, could not recede; but the moment  Edgar had seated she, hastily  turned round, to inquire who else was most fatigued.
the Oxonian now felt lost!
suddenly, abruptly, but irretrievably lost!
The  cypher  Edgar saw—the question 'whose carriage is that?'
Edgar heard—the answer  'yours' made  Edgar gasp for breath, and the instantaneous acceptance stung  Edgar to  the soul.
Wholly in desperation,  Edgar rushed to the opposite window of the  chariot, and calling out, 'enough, cruel!—cruel!—enough—I will see you no  more!'
hurried out of sight.
Indiana, who, for the first time, thought she mistress of a new and elegant  equipage, was so busily employed in examining the trappings and the lining,  that she bore  Edgar departure without a sigh; though but an instant before it  might have cost she something near one.
Eugenia   had been touched more deeply.
Eugenia   was ignorant of what had passed, but  Eugenia   had seen the agitation of Melmond, and the moment he disappeared, Eugenia    ejaculated secretly: 'Ah!
had he conceived the prepossession of Bellamy!
where  had been my steadiness?
where, O Clermont!
thy security!—'  The scrupulous delicacy of her mind was shocked at this suggestion, and Eugenia    rejoiced Eugenia   had not been put to such a trial.
Edgar now explained, that when  Edgar arrived at the cottage,  Edgar found, as  Edgar had  foreseen, the garden chair waiting there, by mistake, and Robert in much  distress, having just discovered that an accident had happened to one of the  wheels.
Edgar had run on, therefore,  Edgar, to Beech Park, for  Edgar own new  chariot, which was lately arrived from town, making Robert follow with Sir  Hugh's horses, as Sir   own were out at grass.
It was dinner-time, and Sir Hugh, equally vexed and fatigued, resolved to  return straight home.
Sir Hugh accepted, therefore, a place in the chariot, bid  Eugenia   follow Sir Hugh, and Robert make haste; solemnly adding to the latter: 'I  had fully intended making you the proper lecture upon your not coming in time;  but as it has turned out not to be your fault, on account of an accident, I  shall say no more; except to give you a hint not to do such a thing again,  because we have all been upon the point of being tossed by a mad bull; which  would certainly have happened, but for the lucky chance of its turning out a  false alarm.'
The remainder of her party proceeded without further adventure.
Edgar attended  Camilla; Miss Margland adhered to Bellamy: Lionel, who durst not venture at any  new frolic, but with whom time lingered when none was passing, retreated; Dr.  Marchmont, who was near Dr.   home, soon also made Dr.   bow; and Dr. Orkborne, who  was glad to be alone, ruminated with wonder upon what appeared to Dr.   a  phenomenon, a man of learning who could deign to please and seem pleased where  books were not the subject of discourse, and where scholastic attainments were  not required to elucidate a single sentence.
