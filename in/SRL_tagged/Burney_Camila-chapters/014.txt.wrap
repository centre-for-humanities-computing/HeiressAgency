 A Declaration  At night, while they were enjoying the bright beams of the moon, from an  apartment in the front of the house, they observed a strange footman, in a  superb livery, ride towards the servants hall; and presently a letter was  delivered to Miss Margland.  She opened it with an air of exulting consequence; one which was inclosed, she  put into her pocket, and read the other three or four times over, with looks of  importance and complacency. She then pompously demanded a private audience with  Sir Hugh, and the young party left the room.  'Well, sir!' she cried, proudly, 'you may now see if I judged right as to  taking the young ladies a little into the world. Please to look at this letter,  sir:'  To Miss Margland, at Sir Hugh Tyrold's, Bart. Cleves, Hampshire.  Madam,  With the most profound respect I presume to address you, though only upon the  strength of that marked politeness which shines forth in your deportment. I  have the highest ambition to offer a few lines to the perusal of Miss Eugenia  Tyrold, previous to presenting myself to Sir Hugh. My reasons will be contained  in the letter which I take the liberty to put into your hands. It is only under  your protection, madam, I can aim at approaching that young lady, as all that I  have either seen or heard convinces me of her extraordinary happiness in being  under your direction. Your influence, madam, I should therefore esteem as an  honour, and I leave it wholly to your own choice, whether to read what I have  addressed to that young lady before or after she has deigned to cast an eye  upon it herself. I remain, with the most profound respect,  Madam,                                         your most obedient,                     and obliged servant,           Alphonso Bellamy.  I shall take the liberty to send my servant for an answer tomorrow evening.  'This, sir,' continued Miss Margland, when Sir Hugh had read the letter; 'this  is the exact conduct of a gentleman; all open, all respectful. No attempt at  any clandestine intercourse. All is addressed where it ought to be, to the  person most proper to superintend such an affair. This is that very same  gentleman whose politeness I mentioned to you, and who danced with Miss Eugenia  at Northwick, when nobody else took any notice of her. This is—'  'Why then this is one of the most untoward things,' cried Sir Hugh, who, vainly  waiting for a pause, began to speak without one, 'that has ever come to bear;  for where's the use of Eugenia's making poor young fellows fall in love with  her for nothing? which I hold to be a pity, provided it's sincere, which I take  for granted.'  'As to that, sir, I can't say I see the reason why Miss Eugenia should not be  allowed to look about her, and have some choice; especially as the young  gentleman abroad has no fortune; at least none answerable to her expectations.'  'But that's the very reason for my marrying them together. For as he has not  had the small-pox himself, that is, not in the natural way; which, Lord help  me! I thought the best, owing to my want of knowledge; why he'll the more  readily excuse her face not being one of the prettiest, for her kindness in  putting up with his having so little money; being a thing some people think a  good deal of.'  'But, sir, won't it be very hard upon poor Miss Eugenia, if a better offer  should come, that she must not listen to it, only because of a person she has  never seen, though he has no estate?'  'Mrs. Margland,' said Sir Hugh, (with some heat,) 'this is the very thing that  I would sooner have given a crown than have had happen! Who knows but Eugenia  may take a fancy to this young jackanapes? who, for aught I know, may be as  good a man as another, for which I beg his pardon; but, as he is nothing to me,  and my nephew's my nephew, why am I to have the best scheme I ever made knocked  on the head, for a person I had as lieve were twitched into the Red Sea? which,  however, is a thing I should not say, being what I would not do.'  Miss Margland took from her pocket the letter designed for Eugenia, and was  going to break the seal; but Sir Hugh, preventing her, said: 'No, Miss  Margland; Eugenia shall read her own letters. I have not had her taught all  this time, by one of the first scholars of the age, as far as I can tell, to  put that affront upon her.'  He then rang the bell, and sent for Eugenia.  Miss Margland stated the utter impropriety of suffering any young lady to read  a letter of that sort, till proposals had been laid before her parents and  guardians. But Sir Hugh spoke no more till Eugenia appeared.  'My dear,' he then said, 'here is a letter just come to put your education to  the trial; which, I make no doubt, will stand the test properly: therefore, in  regard to the answer, you shall write it all yourself, being qualified in a  manner to which I have no right to pretend; though I shall go to-morrow to my  brother, which will give me a better insight; his head being one of the best.'  Eugenia, greatly surprised, opened the letter, and read it with visible emotion.  'Well, my dear, and what do you say to it?'  Without answering, she read it again.  Sir Hugh repeated the question.  'Indeed, sir,' said she, (in a tone of sadness,) 'it is something that afflicts  me very much!'  'Lord help us!' cried Sir Hugh, 'this comes of going to a ball! which, begging  Miss Margland's pardon, is the last time it shall be done.'  Miss Margland was beginning a vehement defence of herself; but Sir Hugh  interrupted it, by desiring to see the letter.  Eugenia, with increased confusion, folded it up, and said: 'Indeed,  sir—Indeed, uncle—it is a very improper letter for me to shew.'  'Well, that,' cried Miss Margland, 'is a thing I could never have imagined!  that a gentleman, who is so much the gentleman, should write an improper  letter!'  'No, no,' interrupted she, 'not improper—perhaps—for him to write,—but  for me to exhibit.'  'O, if that's all, my dear,' said Sir Hugh, 'if it's only because of a few  compliments, I beg you not to mind them, because of their having no meaning;  which is a thing common enough in the way of making love, by what I hear;  though such a young thing as you can know nothing of the matter, your learning  not going in that line; nor Dr. Orkborne's neither, if one may judge; which,  God forbid I should find fault with, being no business of mine.'  He then again asked to see the letter; and Eugenia, ashamed to refuse, gave it,  and went out of the room.  To Miss Eugenia Tyrold, Cleves.  Madam,  The delicacy of your highly cultivated mind awes even the violent passion which  you inspire. And to this I entreat you to attribute the trembling fear which  deters me from the honour of waiting upon Sir Hugh, while uncertain, if my  addressing him might not raise your displeasure. I forbear, therefore, to lay  before him my pretensions for soliciting your favour, from the deepest  apprehension you might think I presumed too far, upon an acquaintance, to my  unhappiness, so short; yet, as I feel it to have excited in me the most lasting  attachment, from my fixed admiration of your virtues and talents, I cannot  endure to run the risk of incurring your aversion. Allow me then, once more,  under the sanction of that excellent lady in whose care I have had the honour  of seeing you, to entreat one moment's audience, that I may be graced with your  own commands about waiting upon Sir Hugh, without which, I should hold myself  ungenerous and unworthy to approach him; since I should blush to throw myself  at your feet from an authority which you do not permit. I beseech you, madam,  to remember, that I shall be miserable till I know my doom; but still, that the  heart, not the hand, can alone bestow happiness on a disinterested mind.  I have the honour to be,                                                              Madam,                                                                             your most devoted and obedient humble servant,           Alphonso Bellamy.  Sir Hugh, when he had finished the letter, heaved a sigh, and leant his head  upon his hand, considering whether or not to let it be seen by Miss Margland;  who, however, not feeling secure what his determination might be, had so  contrived to sit at the table as to read it at the same time with himself. Nor  had she weighed the interest of her curiosity amiss; Sir Hugh, dreading a  debate with her, soon put the letter into his pocket-book, and again sent for  Eugenia.  Eugenia excused herself from returning, pleaded a head-ache, and went to bed.  Sir Hugh was in the deepest alarm; though the evening was far advanced, he  could scarce refrain from going to Etherington directly; he ordered his  carriage to be at the door at eight o'clock the next morning; and sent a second  order, a moment after, that it should not be later than half past seven.  He then summoned Camilla, and, giving her the letter, bid her run with it to  her sister, for fear it was that she was fretting for. And soon after, he went  to bed, that he might be ready in the morning.  Eugenia, meanwhile, felt the placid composure of her mind now for the first  time shaken. The assiduities of this young man had already pleased and  interested her; but, though gratified by them in his presence, they occurred to  her no more in his absence. With the Oxonian she had been far more struck; his  energy, his sentiments, his passion for literature, would instantly have  riveted him in her fairest favour, had she not so completely regarded herself  as the wife of Clermont Lynmere, that she denied her imagination any power over  her reason.  This letter, however, filled her with sensations wholly new. She now first  reflected seriously upon the nature of her situation with regard to Clermont,  for whom she seemed bespoken by her uncle, without the smallest knowledge how  they might approve or suit each other. Perhaps he might dislike her; she must  then have the mortification of being refused: perhaps he might excite her own  antipathy; she must then either disappoint her uncle, or become a miserable  sacrifice.  Here, on the contrary, she conceived herself an elected object. The difference  of being accepted, or being chosen, worked forcibly upon her mind; and, all  that was delicate, feminine, or dignified in her notions, rose in favour of him  who sought, when opposed to him who could only consent to receive her.  Generous, too, he appeared to her, in forbearing to apply to Sir Hugh, without  her permission; disinterested, in declaring he did not wish for her hand  without her heart; and noble, in not seeking her in a clandestine manner, but  referring every thing to Miss Margland.  The idea also of exciting an ardent passion, lost none of its force from its  novelty to her expectations. It was not that she had hitherto supposed it  impossible; she had done less; she had not thought of it all. Nor came it now  with any triumph to her modest and unassuming mind; all it brought with it was  gratitude towards Bellamy, and a something soothing towards herself, which,  though inexplicable to her reason, was irresistible to her feelings.  When Camilla entered with the letter, she bashfully asked her, if she wished to  read it? Camilla eagerly cried: 'O, yes.' But, having finished it, said: 'It is  not such a letter as Edgar Mandlebert would have written.'  'I am sure, then,' said Eugenia, colouring, 'I am sorry to have received it.'  'Do you not observe every day,' said Camilla, 'the distance, the delicacy of  his behaviour to Indiana, though Miss Margland says their marriage is fixed;  how free from all distinction that might confuse her? This declaration, on the  contrary, is so abrupt—and from so new an acquaintance—'  'Certainly, then, I won't answer it,' said Eugenia, much discomposed; 'it had  not struck me thus at first reading; but I see now all its impropriety.'  She then bid good night to Camilla; who, concluding her the appropriated wife  of Clermont, had uttered her opinion without scruple.  Eugenia now again read the letter; but not again with pleasure. She thought it  forward and presumptuous; and the only gratification that remained upon her  mind, was an half conscious scarce admitted, and, even to herself,  unacknowledged charm, in a belief, that she possessed the power to inspire an  animated regard.
