 The Pleadings of Pity  To oblige Mr. Tyrold, who had made the arrangement with Sir Hugh, Eugenia  consented to dine and spend the day at Etherington, which she quitted at night  in a temper of mind perfectly composed.  Camilla was deeply penetrated by the whole of this affair. The sufferings, so  utterly unearned by fault or by folly, of a sister so dear to her, and the  affecting fortitude which, so quickly upon her wounds, and at so early a period  of life, she already began to display, made her blush at the dejection into  which she was herself cast by every evil, and resolve to become in future more  worthy of the father and the sister, who at this moment absorbed all her  admiration.  Too reasonable, in such a frame of mind, to plan forgetting Mandlebert, she now  only determined to think of him as she had thought before her affections became  entangled; to think of him, in short, as he seemed himself to desire; to seek  his friendly offices and advice, but to reject every offered establishment, and  to live single for life.  Gratified by indulgent praise, and sustained by exerted virtue, the revived  Eugenia had nearly reached Cleves, on her return, when the carriage was stopt  by a gentleman on horseback, who, approaching the coach window, said, in a low  voice, as if unwilling to be heard by the servants—'O, Madam! has Fate set  aside her cruelty? and does Fortune permit me to live once more?'  She then recollected Mr. Bellamy. She had only her maid in the carriage, who  was sent for her by Sir Hugh, Miss Margland being otherwise engaged.  All that had so lately passed upon her person and appearance being full upon  her mind, she involuntarily shrunk back, hiding her face with her cloak.  Bellamy, by no means conceiving this mark of emotion to be unfavourable,  steadied his horse, by leaning one hand on the coach-window, and said, in a yet  lower voice—'O, Madam! is it possible you can hate me so barbarously?—will  you not even deign to look at me, though I have so long been banished from your  presence?'  Eugenia, during this speech, called to mind, that though new, in some measure,  to herself, she was not so to this gentleman, and ventured to uncover her face;  when the grief painted on the fine features of Bellamy, so forcibly touched  her, that she softly answered—'No, Sir, indeed I do not hate you; I am  incapable of such ingratitude; but I conjure—I beseech you to forget me!'  'Forget you?—O, Madam! you command an impossibility!—No, I am constancy  itself, and not all the world united shall tear you from my heart!'  Jacob, who caught a word or two, now rode up to the other window, and as  Eugenia began—'Conquer, Sir, I entreat you, this ill-fated partiality!—'  told her the horses had been hard-worked, and must go home.  As Jacob was the oracle of Sir Hugh about his horses, his will was prescriptive  law: Eugenia never disputed it, and only saying—'Think of me, Sir, no more!'  bid the coachman drive on.  Bellamy, respectfully submitting, continued, with his hat in his hand, as the  maid informed her mistress, looking after the carriage till it was out of sight.  A tender sorrow now stole upon the just revived tranquillity of the gentle and  generous Eugenia. 'Ah!' thought she, 'I have rendered, little as I seem worthy  of such power, I have rendered this amiable man miserable, though possibly, and  probably, he is the only man in existence whom I could render happy!—Ah! how  may I dare expect from Clermont a similar passion?'  Molly Mill, a very young girl, and daughter of a poor tenant of Sir Hugh,  interrupted these reflections from time to time, with remarks upon their  object. 'Dearee me, Miss,' she cried, 'what a fine gentleman that was!—he  sighed like to split his heart when you said, don't think about me no more.  He's some loveyer, like, I'm sure.'  Eugenia returned home so much moved by this incident, that Sir Hugh, believing  his brother himself had failed to revive her, was disturbed all anew with acute  contrition for her disasters, and feeling very unwell, went to bed before  supper time.  Eugenia retired also; and after spending the evening in soft compassion for  Bellamy, and unfixed apprehensions and distaste for young Lynmere, was  preparing to go to bed, when Molly Mill, out of breath with haste, brought her  a letter.  She eagerly opened it, whilst enquiring whence it came.  'O, Miss, the fine gentleman—that same fine gentleman—brought it himself:  and he sent for me out, and I did not know who I was to go to, for Mary only  said a boy wanted me; but the boy said, I must come with him to the stile; and  when I come there, who should I see but the fine gentleman himself! And he gave  me this letter, and he asked me to give it you—and see! look Miss! what I got  for my trouble!'  She then exhibited a half-guinea.  'You have not done right, Molly, in accepting it. Money is bribery; and you  should have known that the letter was improperly addressed, if bribery was  requisite to make it delivered.'  'Dearee me, Miss, what's half-a-guinea to such a gentleman as that? I dare say  he's got his pockets full of them!'  'I shall not read it, certainly,' cried Eugenia, 'now I know this circumstance.  Give me the wax—I will seal it again.'  She then hesitated whether she ought to return it, or shew it to her uncle, or  commit it to the flames.  That to which she was most unwilling, appeared, to the strictness of her  principles, to be most proper: she therefore determined that the next morning  she would relate her evening's adventure, and deliver the unread letter to Sir  Hugh.  Had this epistle not perplexed her, she had meant never to name its writer.  Persuaded her last words had finally dismissed him, she thought it a high point  of female delicacy never to publish an unsuccessful conquest.  This resolution taken, she went to bed, satisfied with herself, but extremely  grieved at the sufferings she was preparing for one who so singularly loved her.  The next morning, however, her uncle did not rise to breakfast, and was so low  spirited, that fearing to disturb him, she deemed it most prudent to defer the  communication.  But when, after she had taken her lesson from Dr. Orkborne, she returned to her  room, she found Molly Mill impatiently waiting for her: 'O, Miss,' she cried,  'here's another letter for you! and you must read it directly, for the  gentleman says if you don't it will be the death of him.'  'Why did you receive another letter?' said Eugenia, displeased.  'Dearee me, Miss, how could I help it? if you'd seen the taking he was in,  you'd have took it yourself. He was all of a quake, and ready to go down of his  two knees. Dearee me, if it did not make my heart go pit-pat to see him! He was  like to go out of his mind, he said, and the tears, poor gentleman, were all in  his eyes.'  Eugenia now turned away, strongly affected by this description.  'Do, Miss,' continued Molly, 'write him a little scrap, if it's never so  scratched and bad. He'll take it kinder than nothing. Do, Miss, do. Don't be  ill-natured. And just read this little letter, do, Miss, do;—it won't take  you much time, you reads so nice and fast.'  'Why,' cried Eugenia, 'did you go to him again? how could you so incautiously  entrust yourself to the conduct of a strange boy?'  'A strange boy! dearee me, Miss, don't you know it was Tommy Hodd? I knows him  well enough; I knows all the boys, I warrant me, round about here. Come, Miss,  here's pen and ink; you'll run it off before one can count five, when you've a  mind to it. He'll be in a sad taking till he sees me come back.'  'Come back? is it possible you have been so imprudent as to have promised to  see him again?'  'Dearee me, yes, Miss! he'd have made away with himself if I had not. He'd been  there ever since six in the morning, without nothing to eat or drink, a riding  up and down the road, till he could see me coming to the stile. And he says  he'll keep a riding there all day long, and all night too, till I goes to him.'  Eugenia conceived herself now in a situation of unexampled distress. She forced  Molly Mill to leave her, that she might deliberate what course to pursue.  Having read no novels, her imagination had never been awakened to scenes of  this kind; and what she had gathered upon such subjects in the poetry and  history she had studied with Dr. Orkborne, had only impressed her fancy in  proportion as love bore the character of heroism, and the lover that of an  hero. Though highly therefore romantic, her romance was not the common adoption  of a circulating library: it was simply that of elevated sentiments, formed by  animated credulity playing upon youthful inexperience.  'Alas!' cried she, 'what a conflict is mine! I must refuse a man who adores me  to distraction, in disregard of my unhappy defects, to cast myself under the  guidance of one who, perhaps, may estimate beauty so highly as to despise me  for its want!'  This idea pleaded so powerfully for Bellamy, that something like a wish to open  his letters, obtained pardon to her little maid for having brought them. She  suppressed, however, the desire, though she held them alternately to her eyes,  conjecturing their contents, and bewailing for their impassioned writer the  cruel answer they must receive.  Though checked by shame, she had some desire to consult Camilla; but she could  not see her in time, Mrs. Arlbery having insisted upon carrying her in the  evening to a play, which was to be performed, for one night only, by a company  of passing strollers at Northwick.  'My decision,' she cried, 'must be my own, and must be immediate. Ah! how leave  a man such as this, to wander night and day neglected and uncertain of his  fate! With tears he sent me his letters!—what must not have been his despair  when such was his sensibility? tears in a man!—tears, too, that could not be  restrained even till his messenger was out of sight!—how touching!—'  Her own then fell, in tender commiseration, and it was with extreme repugnance  she compelled herself to take such measures as she thought her duty required.  She sealed the two letters in an empty cover, and having directed them to Mr.  Bellamy, summoned Molly Mill, and told her to convey them to the gentleman, and  positively acquaint him she must receive no more, and that those which were  returned had never been read. She bid her, however, add, that she should always  wish for his happiness, and be grateful for his kind partiality; though she  earnestly conjured him to vanquish a regard which she did not deserve, and must  never return.  Molly Mill would fain have remonstrated; but Eugenia, with that firmness which,  even in the first youth, accompanies a consciousness of preferring duty to  inclination, silenced, and sent her off.  Relieved for herself, now the struggle was over, she secretly rejoiced that it  was not for Melmond she had so hard a part to act: and this idea, while it  rendered Bellamy less an object of regret, diminished also something of her  pity for his conflict, by reminding her of the success which had attended her  own similar exertions.  But when Molly returned, her distress was renewed: she brought her these words,  written with a pencil upon the back of her own cover:  'I do not dare, cruellest of your sex, to write you another letter; but if you  would save me from the abyss of destruction, you will let me hear my final doom  from your own mouth. I ask nothing more! Ah! walk but one moment in the park,  near the pales; deny not your miserable adorer this last single request, and he  will fly this fatal climate which has swallowed up his repose for ever! But,  till then, here he will stay, and never quit the spot whence he sends you these  lines, till you have deigned to pronounce verbally his doom, though he should  famish for want of food!  Alphonso Bellamy.'  Eugenia read this with horrour and compassion. She imagined he perhaps thought  her confined, and would therefore believe no answer that did not issue  immediately from her own lips. She sent Molly to him again with the same  message; but Molly returned with a yet worse account of his desperation, and a  strong assurance, that if she would only utter to him a single word, he would  obey, depart, and live upon it the rest of his life.  This completely softened her. Rather than imperiously suffer such a pattern of  respectful constancy to perish, she consented to speak her own negative. But  fearing she might be moved to some sympathy by his grief, she resolved to be  accompanied by Camilla, and deferred, therefore, the interview till the next  day.  Molly brought back his humble acknowledgments for this concession, and an  account that, at last, slowly and sadly, he had ridden away.  Her feelings were now better satisfied than her understanding. She feared what  she had granted was a favour; yet her heart was too tender to reproach a  compliance made upon such conditions, and to prevent such evils.
