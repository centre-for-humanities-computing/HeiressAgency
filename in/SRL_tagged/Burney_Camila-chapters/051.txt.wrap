 A Recall  After two days passed with tolerable, though not natural cheerfulness at the  Grove, Camilla was surprised by the arrival of the carriage of Sir Hugh with a  short note from Eugenia.  To Miss Camilla Tyrold.  An incident has happened that overpowers me with sadness and horror. I cannot  write. I send the chariot. O! come and pass an hour or two at Cleves with your  distressed.  Eugenia!  Camilla could scarcely stop to leave a message for Mrs. Arlbery, before she  flew to the carriage; nor even inquire for her uncle at Cleves, before she ran  to the apartment of Eugenia, and, with a thousand tender caresses, desired to  know what had thus cruelly afflicted her.  'Alas!' she answered, 'my uncle has written to Clermont to come over,—and  informed him with what view!'  She then related, that Indiana, the preceding day, had prevailed with Sir Hugh  to let her go to the Middleton races; and she found he would be quite unhappy  if she refused to be also of the party. That they had been joined by Bellamy on  the race ground, who only, however, spoke to Miss Margland, as Edgar, watchful  and uneasy, scarce let him even see anyone else. But the horses having taken  fright, while they were in a great crowd, Bellamy had persuaded Miss Margland  to alight, while the coach passed a terrible concourse of carriages; and, in  that interval, he had contrived to whisper a claim upon her tacit promise of  viewing the chaise which was for ever to convey him away from her; and, though  her engagement to Edgar made her refuse, he had drawn her, she knows not  herself how, from her party, and, while she was angrily remonstrating, and he  seemed in the utmost despair at her displeasure, Edgar, who had been at first  eluded by being on horseback, dismounted, forced his way to her, and almost  carried her back to the coach, leaving Bellamy, who she was sure had no  sinister design, nearly dead with grief at being unworthily suspected. Edgar,  she however added, was fixed in believing he meant to convey her away; and  Jacob, asserting he saw him purposely frighten the horses, had told his  surmises to Sir Hugh; which he had corroborated by an account that the same  gentleman had stopt to converse with her in her last return from Etherington.  Sir Hugh, terrified, had declared he would no longer live without Clermont upon  the spot. She had felt too much for his disturbance to oppose him at the  moment, but had not imagined his plan would immediately be put into execution,  till, early this morning, he had sent for her, and produced his letter of  recall, which had taken him, he said, the whole night to compose and finish.  Urged by surprise and dissatisfaction, she was beginning a little remonstrance;  but found it made him so extremely unhappy, that, in the fear of a relapse, she  desisted; and, with a shock she knew not when she should overcome, saw the  fatal letter delivered for the post.  Camilla, with much commiseration, inquired if she had consulted with Edgar.  Yes, she answered; and he had extorted her permission to relate the whole  transaction to her father, though in a manner wide from justice to the  ill-fated Bellamy; whose design might be extraordinary, but whose character,  she was convinced, was honourable.  Camilla, whose education, though private, had not like that of Eugenia, been  secluded and studious, was far less credulous than her sister, though equally  artless. She knew, too, with regard to this affair, the opinion of Edgar, and  to know and be guided by it was imperceptibly one. She declared herself,  therefore, openly against Bellamy, and made her motives consist in a commentary  upon his proceedings.  Eugenia warmly defended him, declaring the judgment of Camilla, and that of all  her friends, to be formed in the dark; for that none of them could have doubted  a moment his goodness or his honour, had they seen the distracted suffering  that was marked in his countenance.  'And what,' cried Camilla, 'says my father to all this?'  'He says just what Edgar says:—he is all that is kind and good, but he has  never beheld Bellamy—how, then, should he know him?'  A message came now from Sir Hugh to Camilla, that he would see her before she  went, but that he was resting at present from the fatigue of writing a letter.  He sent her, however, with his love, the foul copy, to amuse her till she could  come to him.  To Clermont Lynmere Esq.  Dear Nephew,  I have had a very dangerous illness, and the doctors themselves are all  surprised that I recovered; but a greater doctor than them was pleased to save  me, for which I thank God. But as this attack has made me think more than ever  I thought before, I am willing to turn my thoughts to good account.  Now, as I have not the gift of writing, at which, thank God, I have left off  repining, from the reason of its great troublesomeness in acquiring, I can't  pretend to any thing of a fine letter, but shall proceed to business.  My dear Clermont, I write now to desire you would come over out of hand; which  I hope you won't take unkind, foreign parts being no great pleasure to see, in  comparison of old England; besides which, I have another apology to offer,  which is, having a fine prize in view for you; which is the more essential,  owing to some unlucky circumstances, in which I did not behave quite as well as  I wish, though very unwillingly; which I mention to you as a warning. However,  you have no need to be cast down, for this prize will set all right, and make  you as rich as a lord, at the same time that you are as wise as a philosopher.  And as learning, though I have the proper respect for it, won't serve to make  the pot boil, you must needs be glad of more substantial fuel; for there's no  living upon air, however you students may affect to think eating mere gluttony.  Now, this prize is no other than your cousin Eugenia Tyrold, whom I don't tell  you is a beauty; but if you are the sensible lad I take you for, you won't  think the worse of her for wanting such frail perfections. Besides, we should  not be too nice amongst relations, for if we are, what can we expect from the  wide world? So I beg you to come over with all convenient speed, for fear of  her falling a prey to some sharper, many such being to be found; especially at  horse-races, and so forth. I remain,  Dear nephew,                               Your affectionate uncle,           Hugh Tyrold.  Eugenia, from motives of delicacy and of shame, declined reading the copy as  she had declined reading the letter; but looked so extremely unhappy, that  Camilla offered to plead with her uncle, and use her utmost influence that he  would countermand the recall.  'No,' answered she, 'no! 'tis a point of duty and gratitude, and I must bear  its consequences.'  She was now called down to Mr. Tyrold. Camilla accompanied her.  He told her he had gathered, from the kind zeal and inquiries of Edgar, that  Bellamy had certainly laid a premeditated plan for carrying her off, if she  went to the races; which, as the whole neighbourhood was there, might  reasonably be expected.  Eugenia, with fervour, protested such wickedness was impossible.  'I am unwilling, my dear child,' he answered, 'to adulterate the purity of your  thoughts and expectations, by inculcating suspicions; but, though nature has  blessed you with an uncommon understanding, remember, in judgment you are still  but fifteen, and in experience but a child. One thing, however, tell me  candidly, is it from love of justice, or is it for your happiness you combat  thus ardently for the integrity of this young man?'  'For my justice, Sir!' said she firmly.  'And no latent reason mingles with and enforces it?'  'None, believe me! save only what gratitude dictates.'  'If your heart, then, is your own, my dear girl, do not be uneasy at the letter  to Clermont. Your uncle is the last man upon earth to put any constraint upon  your inclinations; and need I add to my dearest Eugenia, I am the last father  to thwart or distress them? Resume, therefore, your courage and composure; be  just to your friends, and happy in yourself.'  Reason was never thrown away upon Eugenia. Her mind was a soil which received  and naturalized all that was sown in it. She promised to look forward with more  cheerfulness, and to dwell no longer upon this agitating transaction.  Edgar now came in. He was going to Beech Park to meet Bellamy. He was charged  with a long message for him from Sir Hugh; and an order to inform him that his  niece was engaged; which, however, he declined undertaking, without first  consulting her.  This was almost too severe a trial of the duty and fortitude of Eugenia. She  coloured, and was quitting the room in silence: but presently turning back, 'My  uncle,' she cried, 'is too ill now for argument, and he is too dear to me for  opposition:—Say, then, just what you think will most conduce to his  tranquillity and recovery.'  Her father embraced her; Camilla shed tears; and Edgar, in earnest admiration,  kissed her hand. She received their applause with sensibility, but looked down  with a secret deduction from its force, as she internally uttered, 'My task is  not so difficult as they believe! touched as I am with the constancy of  Bellamy—It is not Melmond who loves me! it is not Melmond I reject!—'  Edgar was immediately setting off, but, stopping him—'One thing alone I beg,'  she said; 'do not communicate your intelligence abruptly. Soften it by  assurances of my kind wishes.—Yet, to prevent any deception, any future  hope—say to him—if you think it right—that I shall regard myself,  henceforward, as if already in that holy state so sacred to one only object.'  She blushed, and left them, followed by Camilla.  'If born but yesterday,' cried Mr. Tyrold, while his eyes glistened, 'she could  not be more perfectly free from guile.'  'Yet that,' said Edgar, 'is but half her praise; she is perfectly free, also,  from self! she is made up of disinterested qualities and liberal sensations. To  the most genuine simplicity, she joins the most singular philosophy; and to  knowledge and cultivation, the most uncommon, adds all the modesty as well as  innocence of her extreme youth and inexperience.'  Mr. Tyrold subscribed with frankness to this just praise of his highly-valued  daughter; and they then conferred upon the steps to be taken with Bellamy, whom  neither of them scrupled to pronounce a mere fortune-hunter. All the inquiries  of Edgar were ineffectual to learn any particulars of his situation. He said he  was travelling for his amusement; but he had no recommendation to anyone;  though, by being constantly well-dressed, and keeping a shewy footman, he had  contrived to make acquaintance almost universally in the neighbourhood. Mr.  Tyrold determined to accompany Edgar to Beech Park himself, and there, in the  most peremptory terms, to assure him of the serious measures that would ensue,  if he desisted not from his pursuit.  He then went to take leave of Camilla, who had been making a visit to her  uncle, and was returning to the Grove.  He had seen with concern the frigid air with which Edgar had bowed to her upon  his entrance, and with compassion the changed countenance with which she had  received his formal salutation. His hope of the alliance now sunk; and so  favourite a wish could not be relinquished without severe disappointment; yet  his own was immaterial to him when he looked at Camilla, and saw in her  expressive eyes the struggle of her soul to disguise her wounded feelings. He  now regretted that she had not accompanied her mother abroad; and desired  nothing so earnestly as any means to remove her from all intercourse with  Mandlebert. He seconded, therefore, her speed to be gone, happy she would be  placed where exertion would be indispensable; and gently, yet clearly,  intimated his wish that she should remain at the Grove, till she could meet  Edgar without raising pain in her own bosom, or exciting suspicions in his.  Cruelly mortified, she silently acquiesced. He then said whatever was most kind  to give her courage; but, dejected by her conscious failure, and afflicted by  the change in Edgar, she returned to Mrs. Arlbery in a state of mind the most  melancholy.  And here, nothing could be less exhilarating nor less seasonable than the first  news she heard.  The regiment of General Kinsale was ordered into Kent, in the neighbourhood of  Tunbridge: It was the season for drinking the water of that spring; and Mr.  Dennel was going thither with his daughter. Sir Sedley Clarendel conceived it  would be serviceable also to his own health; and had suddenly proposed to Mrs.  Arlbery forming a party to pass a few weeks there. With a vivacity always ready  for any new project, she instantly agreed to it, and the journey was settled to  take place in three days. When Camilla was informed of this intended excursion,  the disappointment with which it overpowered her was too potent for disguise:  and Mrs. Arlbery was so much struck with it, that, during coffee, she took Sir  Sedley apart, and said; 'I feel such concern for the dismal alteration of that  sweet girl, that I could prevail with myself, all love-lorn as she is, to take  her with me to Tunbridge, if you will aid my hardy enterprise of driving that  frozen composition of premature wisdom from her mind. If you are not as  invulnerable as himself, you cannot refuse me this little sleight of gallantry.'  Sir Sedley gave a laughing assent, declaring, at the same time, with the  strongest professed diffidence, his conscious inability. Mrs. Arlbery, in high  spirits, said she scarce knew which would most delight her, to mortify Edgar,  or restore Camilla to gaiety and independance. Yet she would watch, she said,  that matters went no further than just to shake off a whining first love; for  the last thing upon earth she intended was to entangle her in a second.  Camilla received the invitation with pleasure yet anxiety: for though glad to  be spared returning to Cleves in a state of disturbance so suspicious, she was  bitterly agitated in reflecting upon the dislike of Edgar to Mrs. Arlbery, the  pains he had taken to prevent her mingling with this society, and the probably  final period to his esteem and good-will, that would prove the result of her  accompanying such a party to a place of amusement.
