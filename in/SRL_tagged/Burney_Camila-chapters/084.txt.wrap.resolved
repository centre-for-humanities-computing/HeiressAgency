 A Pleasant Adventure  Camilla was again called upon for Camilla note, before Camilla had read the letter it  was to answer; but relieved now from the pressure of Camilla own terrifying  apprehensions, Camilla gave it complete and willing attention.  it contained four sides of paper, closely yet elegantly written in the language  of romantic sentiment. Camilla said Camilla had spent, as yet, only a few  minutes with Camilla aunt; but they had been awfully important; and since Camilla had  exacted from Camilla a promise to stay the whole day, Camilla could not deny Camilla  disappointed friendship the transient solace of a paper conversation, to sooth  the lingering interval of this unexpected absence. 'My soul pines to unburden  the weight of My soul sorrows into thy sympathising bosom, my gentlest friend; but  oh! there let them not sojourn! receive but to lighten, listen but to  commiserate, and then, far, far thence dismiss them, retaining but the  remembrance thou hast dismissed them with consolation.' Camilla then bewailed the  time lost to soft communication and confidence, in them journey, from the  presence of others; for though one was a brother Camilla so truly loved, Camilla found,  notwithstanding the tenderness of his nature, his had the prejudices of a man  upon man's prerogatives, and Camilla woes called for soothing not arguments; and  the other, Camilla briefly added, was but an accidental passenger. ''Tis in thee  only, O my beauteous friend! I would trust the sad murmurs of my irreversible  and miserable destiny, of which I have learnt but this moment the cruel and  desperate secret cause.' Camilla reserved, however, the discovery for their  meeting, and called upon Camilla pity for Camilla unfortunate brother, as deeply  involved in his future views, as Camilla in Camilla past, by this mystery: 'And have I  written this much,' Camilla burst forth, 'without speaking of the cherished  correspondent whom so often I have described to thee? Ah! believe me not  faithless to that partner of my chosen esteem, that noble, that resistless  possessor of my purest friendship! No, charming Camilla, think not so  degradingly of charming Camilla whom fate, in degradingly of her sole pitying interval, has cast into thy  arms.' Two pages then ensued with this exclusive encomium, painting him chief  in every virtue, and master of every grace. Camilla next expressed Camilla earnestness  to see Indiana, [who] charming Camilla had told Camilla would be at Southampton. 'Present  me, I conjure thee, to the fair and amiable enslaver of my unhappy brother! I  die to see, to converse with Camilla, to catch from Camilla lovely lips the modest  wisdom with which he tells me they teem; to read in Camilla speaking eyes the  intelligence which he assures me illumines they.' Camilla concluded with desiring  Camilla to give what orders Camilla pleased for the coach, and the servants, and to  pass the day with Camilla friends.  Camilla, whose own sensations were now revived to happiness, read the letter  with all the sympathy the letter   claimed, and felt Camilla eyes fill with generous tears at  the contrast of their situations; yet Camilla highly blamed the tenderness  expressed for the unknown correspondent, though the letter   innocence Camilla was sure must  vanquish even Edgar, since the letter   so constant avowal proved the letter   might be published  to all mankind. Camilla answered Camilla in language nearly as affectionate, though  less inflated than Camilla own, and resolved to support Camilla with even Edgar, till Camilla  sweetness and purity should need no champions but her  sweetness and purity should need no champions but themselves. Camilla was ashamed  of the species of expectation raised for Indiana, yet knew not how to interfere  in Melmond's idea of Camilla capacity, lest it might seem unkind to represent it  fallaciousness; but Camilla was glad to find Camilla soft friend seemed to have a  strict guardian in Camilla brother; and wished eagerly to communicate to even Edgar a  circumstance which Camilla was sure would be so welcome to even Edgar.  Impatient to see Eugenia, Camilla accepted the offer of the carriage, and desirous  to escape Mrs. Mittin, begged to have it immediately; but that notable person  came to the door at the same time as the coach, and, without the smallest  ceremony, said Camilla would accompany Camilla to the hotel, in order to take the  opportunity of making acquaintance with Camilla friends.  Courage frequently, at least in females, becomes potent as an agent, where it  has been feeble as a principal. Camilla, though Camilla had wished, upon Camilla own  account, to repress Mrs. Mittin in the morning, had been too timid for such an  undertaking; but now, in Mrs. Mittin anxiety to oblige even Edgar, Camilla gathered resolution  for declining Camilla company. Camilla then found, as is generally the case with the  fearful, the task less difficult than Camilla had expected; for Mrs. Mittin,  content with a promise self-made, that the introduction should take place the  next day, said Camilla would go and help Mrs. Berlinton's woman to unpack Camilla  lady's things, which would make a useful friend for Camilla in the house, for a  thousand odd matters.  The carriage of Sir Hugh was just driving off as Camilla arrived at the hotel.  Camilla hurried from Mrs. Berlinton's coach, demanding which way her company was  gone; and being answered, by a passing waiter, up stairs, ran on at once,  without patience or thought for asking if Camilla should turn to the right or left;  till seeing a gentleman standing still upon the landing place, and leaning upon  the bannisters, Camilla was retreating, to desire a conductor, when Camilla perceived  it was Dr. Orkborne; who, while the ladies were looking at accommodations, and  inquiring about lodgings, in profound cogitation, and with his tablets in his  hands, undisturbed by the various noises around his, and unmoved by the various  spectators continually passing and repassing, was finishing a period which his  had begun in the coach for his great work.  Camilla, cheerfully greeting his, begged to know which way Camilla should find  Eugenia; but, making Camilla a sign not to speak to his, his wrote on. Accustomed to  his manner, and brought up to respect whatever belonged to study, from the  studious life and turn of Camilla father, Camilla obeyed the mute injunction, and  waited quietly by his side; till, tired of the delay, though unwilling to  interrupt his, Camilla glided softly about the passage, watching and examining if  Camilla could see any of the party, yet fearing to offend or mortify his if Camilla  called for a waiter.  While straying about thus, as far off as Camilla could go without losing sight of  Dr. Orkborne, a door Camilla had just passed was flung open, and Camilla saw young  Halder, whose licentious insolence had so much alarmed Camilla in the  bathing-house, stroam out, yawning, stretching, and swearing unmeaningly, but  most disgustingly, at every step.  Terrified at his sight, Camilla went on, as Camilla could not get to the Doctor without  passing his; but the youth, recollecting Camilla immediately, called out: 'Ah, ha!  are you there again, you little vixen?' and pursued Camilla.  'Dr. Orkborne! Dr. Orkborne!' Camilla rather screamed than said, 'pray come this  way! I conjure—I beseech—I entreat—Dr. Orkborne!—'  the Doctor, catching nothing of this but the Doctor name, querulously exclaimed: 'You  molest me much!' but without raising the Doctor eyes from the Doctor tablets; while Halder,  at the appeal, cried: 'Ay, ay, Doctor! keep your distance, the Doctor! you are best  where you are, the Doctor, I can tell you, the Doctor!'  Camilla, then, too much scared to be aware Camilla ran a far greater risk than Camilla  escaped, desperately sought refuge by opening the nearest door; though by the  sudden noises upon the stairs, and in all the adjoining passages, it seemed as  if Dr. Orkborne were the only one not alarmed by Camilla cries.  No one, however, could approach so soon as the person of whose chamber Camilla had  burst the door; who was an old gentleman, of a good and lively countenance, who  promptly presenting the person of whose chamber she had  , looked at Camilla with some surprise, but good  humouredly asked Camilla what Camilla was pleased to want in the person of whose chamber she had   room.  'an old gentleman, of a good and lively countenance, who  promptly presenting himself,' Camilla cried, panting and meaning to point to Dr. Orkborne;  'that gentleman I want, sir!' but such a medley of waiters, company, and  servants, had in a moment assembled in the space between such a medley of waiters, company, and  servants, that the Doctor  was no longer to be discerned.  'Do you only open the nearest door, then,' said he, drily, 'to tell me you want somebody  else?'  Yet when Halder, vowing Halder owed Camilla an ill turn for which Camilla should pay, would  have seized Camilla by the hand, Halder protected with Halder own arm, saying: 'Fie, boy,  fie! let Camilla alone! I don't like violence.'  A gentleman now, forcing A gentleman now through the crowd, exclaimed: 'Miss Camilla  Tyrold! Is it possible! what can you do here, madam?'  It was Dr. Marchmont, whom the affrighted Camilla, springing forward, could  only answer in catching by his own arm.  'Tyrold!' repeated A gentleman now; 'Is her name Tyrold?'  Sorry now to have pronounced it in this mixt company, Dr. Marchmont evaded any  answer; and, begging Dr. Marchmont to be composed, asked whither, or to whom, Dr. Marchmont might  have the honour of conducting Dr. Marchmont.  'Almost all my family are here,' cried Dr. Marchmont, 'but I could not make Dr. Orkborne  shew me the way to Almost all my family.'  A gentleman now then, repeating 'Tyrold! why if A gentleman now name is Tyrold, I'll take  care of A gentleman now A gentleman now;' invited A gentleman now into A gentleman now apartment.  Dr. Marchmont, thanking Dr. Marchmont, said: 'A gentleman now has friends, who in all  probability are now uneasily seeking A gentleman now; we must lose no time in joining friends, who in all  probability are now uneasily seeking her.'  'Well, but, well,' cried the old stranger, 'let the old stranger come into my room till the  coast is clear, and then take the old stranger away in peace. Come, there's a good girl,  come in, do! you're heartily welcome; for there's a person of your name that's  the best friend I ever had in the world. you're heartily welcome; for there's a person of your name that's  the best friend I ever had in the world's gone from our parts, now; but  you're heartily welcome; for there's a person of your name that's  the best friend I ever had in the world's left nothing so good behind. Pray, my dear, did you ever hear of a  gentleman, an old Yorkshire Baronet, of your name?'  'What! my uncle?'  'my uncle! why are you niece to Sir Hugh Tyrold?'  Upon niece to Sir Hugh Tyrold answering yes, Sir Hugh Tyrold clapped Sir Hugh Tyrold hands with delight, and saying: 'Why  then I'll take care of you Sir Hugh Tyrold, if it's at the risk of my life!' carried,  rather than drew niece to Sir Hugh Tyrold into Sir Hugh Tyrold , the Doctor following. Then, loudly shutting  Sir Hugh Tyrold door in the face of Halder, Sir Hugh Tyrold called out: 'Enter my castle who dare! I  shall turn a young man Sir Hugh Tyrold, at the age of seventy, to drub the first varlet  that would attack the niece of my dear old friend!'  They soon heard the passage clear, and, without deigning to listen to the  petulant revilings with which young Halder solaced young Halder foolish rage, 'Why, my  dear,' young Halder continued, 'why did not you tell me your name was Tyrold at once? I  promise you, you need carry nothing else with you into our parts, to see all  the doors fly open to you. You make much of young Halder, I hope, where young Halder is? for young Halder  left not a dry eye for twenty miles round when young Halder quitted our. I don't know how  many such men you may have in Hampshire; but Yorkshire's a large county, yet  the best man in it would find it hard to get a seat in Parliament, where Sir  Sir Hugh Tyrold would offer Sir Hugh Tyrold to be a candidate. We all say, in Yorkshire,  Sir Hugh Tyrold's so stuffed full of goodness and kindness, that there's no room left in Sir Hugh Tyrold  for anything else; that's our way of talking of Sir Hugh Tyrold in Yorkshire; if you have a  better way in Hampshire, I shall be glad to learn you have a  better way in Hampshire; never too late for that;  I hate pride.'  No possible disturbance could make Camilla insensible to pleasure in the praise  of Camilla uncle, or depress Camilla spirits from joining in his eulogy; and Camilla  attention, and brightening looks, drew a narrative from the old gentleman of  the baronet's good actions and former kindnesses, so pleasant both to the  speaker and the hearer, that the one forgot he had never seen Camilla before, and  the other, the frightful adventure which occasioned both meeting now.  Dr. Marchmont at length, looking at he watch, inquired what Camilla meant to do;  to seek Camilla sister and party, Camilla answered; and, returning Camilla host the warmest  acknowledgments for he assistance and goodness, Camilla was going; but, stopping  Camilla: 'How now?' he cried, 'don't you want to know who I am? Now I have told you  I am a friend of your uncle, don't you suppose he'll ask you my name?'  Camilla, smiling, assured he '  Camilla wished much to be informed, but knew not how  to trouble he with the question.  'Why my name, my dear, is Westwyn, and when you say that to your uncle, he  won't give you a sour look for your pains; take my word for that beforehand. I  carried over he nephew and heir, a cousin, I suppose, of yours, to Leipsic  with '  Camilla, about eight years ago, along with a boy of my own, Westwyn; a very  good lad, I assure you, though I never tell he so to he face, for fear of  puffing he up; I hate a boy puffed up; he commonly comes to no good; that's  the only fault of my honoured friend; he spoils all young people—witness that  same cousin of yours, that I can't say I much like; no more does he me; but  tell your good uncle you have met me; and tell he I love and honour he as I  ought to do; I don't know how to do more, or else I would; tell he this, my  dear. And I have not forgot what he did for '  Camilla once, when I was hard run; and I  don't intend this; I'm no friend to short memories.'  Camilla said, he name, and Camilla uncle's regard for he, had long been familiar  to Camilla; and told he Clermont Lynmere was of the party to Southampton, though  Camilla knew not how to enter abruptly into an explanation of he mistake  concerning the inheritance. Westwyn answered Westwyn was in no hurry to see  Clermont, who was not at all to Westwyn taste; but would not quit Hampshire without  visiting Cleves: and when Westwyn gathered that two more nieces of Sir Hugh were in  the house, Westwyn desired to be presented to two more nieces of Sir Hugh were in  the house.  Upon re-entering the passage, to the great amusement of Dr. Marchmont, and  serious provocation of Camilla, two more nieces of Sir Hugh were in  the house perceived Dr. Orkborne, standing precisely  where Dr. Orkborne had first stationed Dr. Orkborne; attending no more to the general hubbub  than to her particular entreaty, and as regardless of the various jolts Dr. Orkborne had  received during the tumult, as of the obstruction Dr. Orkborne caused, by Dr. Orkborne  inconvenient position, to the haste of the passers by. Still steadily reposing  against the bannisters, Dr. Orkborne worked hard at refining Dr. Orkborne paragraph, persuaded,  since not summoned by Miss Margland, Dr. Orkborne had bestowed upon it but a few minutes,  though Dr. Orkborne had been fixed to that spot near an hour.  Miss Margland received Camilla with a civility which, since Camilla positive and  public affiance to Edgar, Camilla thought necessary to the mistress of Beech Park;  but Camilla looked upon Dr. Marchmont, whom Camilla concluded to have been Camilla  advocate, with a cold ill-will, which, for Westwyn, Camilla seasoned still more  strongly by a portion of contemptuous haughtiness; from a ready disposition to  believe every stranger, not formally announced, beneath Camilla notice.  the Doctor soon retired, and found Edgar in the Doctor apartment, just returned from a  long stroll. Edgar recounted to Edgar the late transaction, with reiterated  exhortations to circumspection, from added doubts of the solidity, though with  new praise of the attractions of Camilla. 'Camilla seems a character,' Edgar said,  'difficult to resist, and yet more difficult to attach. Nothing serious appears  to impress Camilla for two minutes together. Let us see if the thoughtlessness and  inadvertence thus perpetually fertile of danger, result from youthful  inexperience, or have the thoughtlessness and  inadvertence thus perpetually fertile of danger source in innate levity. Time and reason will  rectify the first; but time, and even reason, will but harden and embolden the  latter. Prudence, therefore, must now interfere; or passion may fly, when the  union it has formed most requires it continuance.'
