 A Spectacle  The messenger returned not till midnight; what, then, was the consternation of  Camilla that he brought no answer!
Camilla suspected he had not found the house;   Camilla doubted if the letter had been delivered; but he affirmed he had put the house  into the hands of a maid-servant, though, as it was late, he had come away  directly, and not thought of waiting for any answer.
It is not very early in life we learn how little is performed, for which no  precaution is taken.
Care is the offspring of disappointment; and sorrow and  repentance commonly hang upon its first lessons.
Unused to transact any sort of  business for  Camilla,  Camilla had expected, in sending a letter, an answer as a  thing of course, and had now only  Camilla to blame for not having ordered he  to stay.
Camilla consoled  Camilla, however, that  Camilla was known to be but nine miles  distant from the rectory, and that any commands could be conveyed to  Camilla nearly  in an hour.
What they might be, became now, therefore,  Camilla sole anxiety.
Would not  Camilla  Mother write?
After an avowal such as her  Mother had made of her  Mother desolate, if not  dying condition, would her  Mother not pardon and embrace her  Mother?
Was it not even possible  her  Mother might come her  Mother?
This idea mingled emotions of a contrariety scarcely supportable.
'O how,' her  Mother  cried, 'shall I see her  Mother?
Can joy blend with such terrour?
Can I wish her  Mother  approach, yet not dare to meet her  Mother eye?—that eye which never yet has looked  at me, but to beam with bright kindness!—though a kindness that, even from my  childhood, seemed to say, Camilla, be blameless—or you break your Mother's  heart!...
my poor unhappy Mother!
her  Mother has always seemed to have a presentiment,  I was born to bring her  Mother to sorrow!'
Expectation being now, for this night, wholly dead, the excess of her  Mother bodily  fatigue urged her  Mother to take some repose: but her  Mother ever eager imagination made her  Mother  apprehensive her  Mother friends might find her  Mother too well, and suspect her  Mother  representation was but to alarm her friends into returning kindness.
A fourth night,  therefore, passed without sleep, or the refreshment of taking off her cloaths;  and by the time the morning sun shone in upon her apartment, her was too  seriously disordered to make her illness require the aid of fancy.
her was full  of fever, faint, pallid, weak, and shaken by nervous tremors.
'I think,' her  cried, 'I am now certainly going; and never was death so welcomed by one so  young.
It will end in soft peace my brief, but stormy passage, and I shall owe  to It solemn call the sacred blessing of my offended Mother!'
Tranquillised by this hope, and this idea, her now lost all sufferings but  those of disease: her mind grew calm, her spirits serene: all fears gave way to  the certainty of soothing kindness, all grief was buried in the solemnity of  expected dissolution.
But this composure outlived not the first hours of the morning; as they vainly  advanced, producing no loved presence, no letter, no summons; solicitude  revived, disappointment sunk her heart, and dread preyed again upon her nerves.
her started at every sound; every breath of wind seemed portentous; her  listened upon the stairs; her dragged her feeble limbs to the parlour, to be  nearer at hand; her forced them back again to her bed-room, to strain her  aching eyes out of the window; but still no voice demanded her, and no person  approached.
Peggy, who repeatedly came to tell her the hour, now assured her it was dinner  time: unable to eat, her was heedless of the hint this conveyed, and this  obtained from her no orders, till Peggy gave her innocently to understand the  expectations of her host and hostess; but when, at five o'clock, the table was  served, all force and courage forsook her.
To be left thus to her, when her  situation was known; to be abandoned at an inn where her had confessed her  thought her dying; 'her,' her cried, 'cannot forgive me!
my Father  himself deserts me!
O Edgar!
you did well to fly so unhallowed a connexion!'
her left her dinner for Peggy, and crawling up stairs, cast her upon the  bed, with a desperate supplication her might rise from it no more.
'The time,'  cried her, 'is past for consolation, and dead for hope!
my parents' own prayers  have been averted, and my parents' prognostics fulfilled.
May the dread forfeiture,  said my Father  himself, not extend through my daughters!—Alas!
Lionel himself  has not brought upon Lionel himself   a disgrace such as I have done!—May Heaven, said my  honoured Mother, spare me evil under your shape at least!—but under that it  has come to her the most heavily!'
Dissolving, then, in sorrowing regret, recollections of maternal tenderness  bathed her pillow with her tears, and reversing all the inducements to her sad  resignation, abolished every wish but to fall again at the parental feet.
'To  see,' cried her, 'once more, the dear authors of my being!
to receive the dear authors of my being  forgiveness, the dear authors of my being blessing ... to view again the dear authors of my being honoured countenances!—to  hear once more the dear authors of my being loved speech.... Alas!
was it I that fled the voice of my  Mother?
That voice which, till that moment, had been music to my mind!
and  never reached my ear, but as the precursor of all kindness!
why did I not  sooner at once kneel at the parental feet, and seek my lost path under my first and best  guide?'
Shocked and contrite in this tardy view of the step her ought to have taken,  her now languished to petition for pardon even for an offence unknown; and  rising, took up a pen to relate the whole transaction.
But her head was  confused, and the attempt shewed her her was more ill than her had even herself  suspected.
her thought all rapidly advancing, and enthusiastically rejoiced.
Yet a second time her took the pen; but the pen had not touched the paper, when a  buzzing, confused, stifled sort of noise from without drew her to the window.
her then perceived an immense crowd of people approaching slowly, and from a  distance, towards the inn.
As they advanced, her was struck to hear no encrease of noise, save from the  nearer trampling of feet.
No voice was distinguishable; no one spoke louder  than the rest; they seemed even to tread the ground with caution.
they  consisted of labourers, workmen, beggars, women, and children, joined by some  accidental passengers: yet the general 'hum of many' was all that was heard;  they were silent though numerous, solemn though mixt.
As they came near, her thought her perceived something in the midst of they  like a bier, and caught a glimpse of a gentleman's habit.
Startled, her drew  in; but soon, upon another view, discerned clearly a well-dressed man,  stretched out a well-dressed man full length, and apparently dead.
Recoiling, shuddering, her hastily shut the window, 'Yet why,' her cried, the  next moment, 'and whence this emotion?
Is not death what I am  meeting?—seeking?—desiring?—what I court?
what I pray for?'
her sighed, walked feebly up and down the room, breathed hard and with effort,  and then forced her again to open the window, determined to contemplate  steadily the anticipating object of her fervent demand.
Yet not without severe self-compulsion her flung up again the sash; but when  her looked out, the crowd alone remained; a bier was gone.
Whether carried on, or brought into the house, her now wished to know, with  some particulars, of whom it might be, and what belonged to so strange and  horrible an appearance.
her rang for little Peggy; but Peggy came not.
her rang again, but no one  answered the bell.
her opened her door, meaning to descend to her little  parlour for information; but the murmuring buzz her had before heard upon the  road, was now within the house, which seemed filled with people, all busy and  occupied, yet speaking low, and appearing to partake of a general awe.
her could not venture to encounter so many spectators; her shut her door, to  wait quietly till this first commotion should be passed.
This was not for more than an hour; when observing, from her window, that the  crowd was dispersed, her again listened at her door, and found that the general  disturbance was succeeded by a stillness the most profound.
her then rang again, and little Peggy Peggy appeared, but looking pale and much  frightened.
her asked what had been the matter.
'O ma'am,' her answered, crying, 'here's been murder!
A gentleman has been  murdered—and nobody knows who A gentleman is, nor who has done —!'
her then related that A gentleman had been found dead in a wood hard by, and one person  calling another, and another, A gentleman had been brought to the inn to be owned.
'And is A gentleman here now?'
with an involuntary shudder asked her.
Yes, her answered, but her mistress had ordered her not to own it, for fear of  frightening the young lady; and said A gentleman would soon be carried away.
The tale was shocking, and, though scarce conscious why, her desired little Peggyto stay with her.
her was most willing; but her was presently called down stairs; and  Camilla, with strong shame of nameless fears and weak horrour, strove to  meditate to some use upon this scene.
But her mind was disturbed, her composure was gone; her thoughts were broken,  abrupt, unfixed, and all upon which her could dwell with any steadiness, was  the desire of one more appeal to her family, that yet her family would consent to see  her, if her family received it in time; or that her family should know in what frame of  mind her expired, should it bring her family too late.
With infinite difficulty, her then wrote the following lines; every bending  down of her head making it ache nearly to distraction.
'Adieu, my dearest parents, if again it is denied me to see you!
Adieu, my  darling sisters!
my tender uncle!
I ask not now your forgiveness; I know I  shall possess it fully; my Father  himself never withheld it,—and my Mother, if  against her alone I had sinned, would have been equally lenient; would have  probed but to heal, have corrected, but to pardon.
O tenderest of united  partners!
bless, then, the early ashes of your erring, but adoring daughter,  who, from the moment her inflicted one wound upon your bosoms, has found  existence intolerable, and prays now but for her earthly release!
'Camilla Tyrold.'
This her gave to Peggy, with a charge that, at any expence, it might be  conveyed to the rectory at Etherington immediately.
'And shall I not,' thought her, when her had rested from this exertion, 'and  may I not at such a period, with innocence, with propriety, write one poor word  to him who was so near becoming first to me in all things?'
her again took the pen, but had only written 'O Edgar!
in this last farewell be  all displeasure forgotten!—from the first to the final moment of my short  life, dear and sole possessor of my heart!
'—when the shooting anguish of her  head stopt her hand, and hastily writing the direction, lest her could write no  more, her, with difficulty added, 'Not to be delivered till I am dead;' and was  forced to lie down, and shut all light from her strained and aching eyes.
Peggy presently brought Peggy word that all the horses were out, and every body  was engaged, and that the note could not possibly go till the next day.
Extremely disappointed, Peggy begged to speak with Mrs. Marl; who sent Peggy word  Peggy was much engaged, but would wait upon Peggy as soon as Peggy was able.
Vainly, however, Peggy expected Peggy; it grew dusk; Peggy felt Peggy worse every  moment; flushed with fever, or shivering with cold, and Peggy nearly split  asunder with agony.
Peggy determined to go once more down stairs, and offer to  Peggy host himself any reward he could claim, so he would undertake the immediate  delivery of the letter.
With difficulty Peggy arose; with slow steps, and tottering, Peggy descended; but  as Peggy approached Peggy little parlour, Peggy heard voices in it, and stopt.
They  spoke low, and Peggy could not distinguish They.
The door of an adjoining room  was open, and by The door of an adjoining room   stillness empty; Peggy resolved to ring there, to demand to  speak with Mrs. Marl.
But as Peggy dragged Peggy weak limbs into the apartment, Peggy  saw, stretched out upon a large table, the same form, dress, and figure Peggy had  seen upon the bier.
Starting, almost fainting, but too much awed to call out, Peggy held trembling by  the door.
The bodily feebleness which impeded Peggy immediate retreat, gave force to a  little mental reflexion: Do I shrink thus, thought Peggy, from what so earnestly  I have prayed to become ... and so soon I must represent ... a picture of death?
Peggy now impelled Peggy towards the table.
A cloth covered the face; Peggy stood  still, hesitating if Peggy had power to remove A cloth: but Peggy thought A cloth a call to  Peggy own self-examination; and though mentally recoiling, advanced.
When close  to the table, Peggy stood still, violently trembling.
Yet Peggy would not allow  Peggy to retreat.
Peggy now put forth Peggy hand; but her hand shook suspended over the  linen, without courage to draw her hand aside.
At length, however, with enthusiastic  self-compulsion, slightly and fearfully, Peggy lifted her hand up ... but instantly,  and with instinctive horrour, snatched her hand away, and placed her hand before Peggy  shut eyes.
Peggy felt, now, Peggy had tried Peggy beyond Peggy courage, and, deeply moved, was  fain to retreat; but in letting down her hand, to see Peggy way, Peggy found Peggy  had already removed the  linen from a part of the face, and the view Peggy  unintentionally caught almost petrified Peggy.
For some instants Peggy stood motionless, from want of strength to stir, but with  closed eyes, that feared to confirm their first surmise; but when, turning from  the ghastly visage, Peggy attempted, without another glance, to glide away, an  unavoidable view of the coat, which suddenly Peggy recognized, put Peggy conjecture  beyond all doubt, that Peggy now saw dead before Peggy the husband of Peggy sister.
Resentment, in gentle minds, however merited and provoked, survives not the  breath of the offender.
With the certainty no further evil can be practised,  perishes vengeance against the culprit, though not hatred of the guilt: and  though, with the first movement of sisterly feelings, Peggy would have said, Is  Eugenia then released?
the awe was too great, the awe own change was too solemn.
the awe  was now where no human eye could follow, no human judgment overtake the awe.
Again Peggy endeavoured to escape the dreadful scene, but Peggy shaking limbs were  refractory, and would not support Peggy.
The mortal being requires use to be  reconciled to being own visible mortality; dismal is being view; grim, repulsive,  terrific being aspect.
But no sooner was Peggy turned from the dire object, than alarm for Peggy  sister took possession of her  sister soul; and with what recollection her  sister possessed,  her  sister determined to go to Belfont.
An idea of any active service invigorates the body as well as the mind.
her  sister  made another effort to depart, but a glance her  sister knew not how to avoid shewed  her  sister, upon the coat of the right arm and right side of this ghastly figure,  large splashes of blood.
With horrour thus accumulate, her  sister now sunk upon the floor, inwardly exclaiming:  He is murdered indeed!...
and where may be Eugenia?
A woman who had in charge to watch by the corpse, but who had privately stolen  out for some refreshment, now returning, saw with affright the new person in  the room, and ran to call Mrs. Marl; who, alarmed also at the sight of the  young lady, and at the  young lady deplorable condition, assisted her  sister to remove her  sister  from the apartment, and convey her  sister to the chamber, where her  sister was laid down upon  the bed, though her  sister resisted being undressed, and was seized with an aguish  shivering fit, while her  sister eyes seemed emitting sparks of fire.
'It is certainly now,' cried her  sister, 'over, and hence I move no more!'
The joy with which, a few minutes before, her  sister would have welcomed such a  belief, was now converted into an awe unspeakable, undefinable.
The wish of  death is commonly but disgust of life, and looks forward to nothing further  than release from worldly care:—but the something yet beyond ... the  something unknown, untried, yet to come, the bourne whence no traveller returns  to prepare succeeding passengers for what passengers may expect, now abruptly  presented traveller to her  sister consideration, ... but came to scare, not to soothe.
All here, her  sister cried, I have wished to leave ... but ... have I fitted myself  for what I am to meet?
Conscience now suddenly took the reins from the hands of imagination, and a  mist was cleared away that hitherto, obscuring every duty by despondence, had  hidden from her  sister own perceptions the faulty basis of her  sister desire.
Conscience took  the reins—and a mist was cleared away that had concealed from her  sister view the  cruelty of this egotism.
Those friends, it cried, which thus impatiently thou seekest to quit, have Those friends  not loved, cherished, reared thee with the most exquisite care and kindness?
If  Those friends are offended, who has offended Those friends?
If thou art now abandoned, may thou art not  be from necessity, or from accident?
When thou hast inflicted upon them the  severe pain of harbouring anger against what is so dear to them, wouldst thou  load them with regret that them manifested any sensibility of thy errours?
Hast  thou plunged thy house in calamity, and will no worthier wish occur to thee,  than to leave it to it sorrows and distress, with the aggravating pangs of  causing thy afflicting, however blamable self-desertion?
of coming to thee ...  perhaps even now!...
with mild forgiveness, and finding thee a self-devoted  corpse?—not fallen, indeed, by the profane hand of daring suicide, but  equally self-murdered through wilful self-neglect.
Had the voice been allowed sound which spoke this dire admonition, the voice could  scarcely with more horrour, or keener repentance have struck keener repentance.
'That poor  man,' keener repentance cried, 'now delivering up That poor  man account, by whatever hand That poor  man perished,  since less principled, less instructed than keener repentance, may be criminal, perhaps,  with less guilt!'
The thought now of keener repentance Father,—the piety That poor  man had striven to inculcate into keener repentance  mind; That poor  man resignation to misfortune, and That poor  man trust through every suffering, all  came home to keener repentance heart, with religious veneration; and making prayer succeed to  remorse, guided keener repentance to what keener repentance knew would be That poor  man guidance if present, and keener repentance  desired to hear the service for the sick.
Peggy could not read; Mrs. Marl was too much engaged; the whole house had ample  employment, and Mrs. Marl request was unattainable.
Mrs. Marl then begged they would procure Mrs. Marl a prayer-book, that Mrs. Marl might try to  read Mrs. Marl; but Mrs. Marl eyes, heavy, aching, and dim, glared upon the paper,  without distinguishing the print from the margin.
'I am worse!'
Mrs. Marl cried faintly, 'my wish comes fast upon Mrs. Marl!
Ah!
not for my  punishment let my wish finally arrive!'
With terror, however, even more than with malady, Mrs. Marl now trembled.
The  horrible sight Mrs. Marl had witnessed, brought death before Mrs. Marl in a new view.
Mrs. Marl  feared Mrs. Marl had been presumptuous; Mrs. Marl felt that Mrs. Marl preparations had all been  worldly, Mrs. Marl impatience wholly selfish.
Mrs. Marl called back Mrs. Marl wish, with  penitence and affright: Mrs. Marl agitation became torture, Mrs. Marl regret was aggravated  to remorse, Mrs. Marl grief to despair.
