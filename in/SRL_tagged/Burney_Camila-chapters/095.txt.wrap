 Touches of Wit and Humour  The suddenness of this blow to Camilla, at the moment when her expectations  from Edgar were wound up to the summit of all she desired, would have stupefied  her into a consternation beyond even affliction, had not the mildness of his  farewell, the kindness of his prayers, and the friendship of his counsels,  joined to the generosity of leaving wholly to herself the account of their  separation, subdued all the pride that sought to stifle her tenderness, and  penetrated her with an admiration which left not one particle of censure to  diminish her regret.  Melmond and his sister, always open to distress, and susceptible to pity, saw  with true concern this melancholy change, and concluded that Mandlebert had  communicated some painful intelligence.  She went straight to her own room, with a sign of supplication that Mrs.  Berlinton would not follow; and turning quick from Mrs. Mittin, who met her at  the street door.  Mrs. Berlinton yielded; but Mrs. Mittin was not easily rebuffed. She was loaded  with lilac plumes, ribbands, and gauzes, and Camilla saw her bed completely  covered with her new ball dress.  This sight was, at first, an aggravation of her agony, by appearing to her as  superfluous as it was expensive: but wherever hope could find an aperture to  creep in at, it was sure of a welcome from Camilla. Edgar was undoubtedly  invited to the ball; why should he not be there? he had taken leave of her,  indeed, and he certainly proposed going abroad; but could a mere meeting once  more, be so repugnant as not to be endured.  The answer to this question was favourable to her wishes, for by her wishes it  was framed: and the next play of her fertile and quick reviving imagination,  described the meeting that would ensue, the accidents that would bring them  into the same set, the circumstances that would draw them again into  conversation, and the sincerity with which she would do justice to her  unalterable esteem, by assuring him how injurious to it were his surmises that  she thought him rigorous, austere, or in any single instance to blame.  These hopes somewhat appeased, though their uncertainty could not banish her  terrors, and she was able to appear at dinner tolerably composed.  Another affair, immediately after, superseded them, for the present, by more  urgent difficulties.  Soon after her arrival at Southampton, a poor woman, who washed for her, made a  petition in behalf of her brother, a petty shop-keeper, who, by various common,  yet pitiable circumstances of unmerited ill success in business, was unable to  give either money or security to the wholesale dealers, for the renewal of his  exhausted stock in trade; though the present full season, made it rational to  suppose, that, if he had his usual commodities, he might retrieve his credit,  save himself from bankruptcy, and his children from beggary. These last, which  were five in number, were all, upon various pretences, brought to Camilla,  whose pity they excited by the innocence with which they seemed ignorant of  requiring it; and who received them with smiles and encouragement, however  frivolous their errands, and frequent their interruptions. But the goods which  their father wanted to lay in, to revive his trade, demanded full thirty  pounds, which, Camilla declared, were as absolutely out of her power to give as  thirty thousand, though she promised to plead to Sir Hugh for the sum, upon her  return to Cleves, and was prevailed with to grant her name to this promise for  the wholesale dealers. These would trust, however, to no verbal security; and  Mrs. Mittin, who from collateral reasons was completely a friend of the poor  man, offered to be bound for him herself, though thirty pounds were nearly her  year's income, provided Camilla would sign a paper, by which she would engage  upon her honour, to indemnify her of any loss she might eventually sustain by  this agreement, as soon as she was of age, or should find it in her power  before that time.  The seriousness of this clause, made Camilla refuse the responsibility,  protesting she should have no added means in consequence of being of age. But  Mrs. Mittin assured Higden, the poor man, as she assured all others, that she  was heiress to immense wealth, for she had had it from one that had it from her  own brother's own mouth; and that though she could not find out why she was so  shy of owning it, she supposed it was only from the fear of being imposed upon.  The steadiness of Camilla, however, could not withstand her compassion, when  the washerwoman brought the poor children to beg for their father; and, certain  of her uncle's bounty, she would have run a far more palpable risk, sooner than  have assumed the force to send them weeping away.  The stores were then delivered; and all the family poured forth their thanks.  But this day, in quitting the dining parlour, she was stopt in the hall by  Higden, who, in unfeigned agonies, related, that some flasks of oil, in a small  hamper, which were amongst the miscellaneous articles of his just collected  stores, had, by some cruel accident, been crushed, and their contents, finding  their way into all the other packages, had stained or destroyed them.  Camilla, to whose foresight misfortune never presented itself, heard this with  nearly equal terror for herself, and sorrow for the poor man: yet her own part,  in a second minute, appeared that of mere inconvenience, compared with his,  which seemed ruin irretrievable; she sought, therefore, to comfort him; but  could afford no further help, since she had painfully to beg from her uncle the  sum already so uselessly incurred. He ventured still to press, that, if again  he could obtain a supply, every evil chance should be guarded against; but  Camilla had now learned that accidents were possible; and the fear which arises  from disappointed trust, made her think of probable mischiefs with too acute a  discernment, to deem it right to run again any hazard, where, if there were a  failure, another, not herself, would be the sufferer. Yet the despair of the  poor man induced her to promise she would write in his favour, though not act  in it again unauthorised.  With feelings of still augmented discomfort, from her denial, she repaired to  her toilette; but attired herself without seeing what she put on, or knowing,  but by Mrs. Mittin's descriptions and boastings, that her dress was new, of the  Pervil uniform, and made precisely like that of Mrs. Berlinton. Her agitated  spirits, suspended, not between hope and fear, but hope and despair, permitted  no examination of its elegance: the recollection of its expence, and the  knowledge that Edgar thought her degenerating into coquetry, left nothing but  regret for its wear.  Mrs. Berlinton, who never before, since her marriage, had been of any party  where her attractions had not been unrivalled, had believed herself superior to  pleasure from personal homage, and knew not, till she missed it, that it made  any part of her amusement in public. But the Beauty, when first she perceives a  competitor for the adulation she has enjoyed exclusively, and the Statesman, at  the first turn of popular applause to an antagonist, are the two beings who,  perhaps, for the moment, require the most severe display of self-command, to  disguise, under the semblance of good humour or indifference, the  disappointment they experience in themselves, or the contempt with which they  are seized for the changing multitude.  Mrs. Berlinton, though she felt no resentment against Camilla for the desertion  she had occasioned her, felt much surprize; not to be first was new to her: and  whoever, in any station of life, any class of society, has had regular and  acknowledged precedency, must own a sudden descent to be rather awkward. Where  resignation is voluntary, to give up the higher place may denote more greatness  of mind than to retain it; but where imposed by others, few things are less  exhilarating to the principal, or impress less respect upon the by-stander.  Mrs. Berlinton had never been vain; but she could not be ignorant of her  beauty; and that the world's admiration should be so wondrously fickle, or so  curiously short-lived, as to make even the bloom of youth fade before the  higher zest of novelty, was an earlier lesson than her mind was prepared to  receive. She thought she had dressed herself that morning with too much  carelessness of what was becoming, and devoted to this evening a greater  portion of labour and study.  While Camilla was impatiently waiting, Mrs. Pollard, the washerwoman, gained  admittance to her, and bringing two interesting little children of from four to  five years old, and an elder girl of eleven, made them join with herself to  implore their benefactress to save them all from destruction.  Higden having had the imprudence, in his grief, to make known his recent  misfortune, it had reached the ears of his landlord, who already was watchful  and suspicious, from a year and half arrears of his rent; and steps were  immediately preparing to seize whatever was upon the premises the next morning;  which, by bringing upon him all his other creditors, would infallibly immure  him in the lingering hopelessness of a prison.  Camilla now wavered; the debt was but eighteen pounds; the noble largesses of  her uncle in charity, till, of late, that he had been somewhat drained by  Lionel, were nearly unlimited.—She paused—looked now at the pleading group,  now at her expensive dress; asked how, for her own hopes, she could risk so  much, yet for their deliverance from ruin so little; and with a blush turning  from the mirrour, and to the children with a tear, finally consented that the  landlord should apply to her the next morning.  Lord Pervil had some time opened the ball before Mrs. Berlinton's arrival; but  he looked every where for Camilla, to succeed to a young lady of quality with  whom he had danced the first two dances. He could not, however, believe he had  found, though he now soon saw and made up to her. The brilliancy of her eyes  was dimmed by weeping, her vivacity was changed into dejection, sighs and looks  of absence took place of smiles and sallies of gaiety, and her whole character  seemed to have lost its spring and elasticity. She gave him her hand, to  preserve her power of giving it if claimed by Edgar, and though he had thought  of her without ceasing since she had charmed him in the yacht, till he had  obtained it, not a lady appeared in the room, by the time these two dances were  over, that he would not more cheerfully have chosen for two more: her gravity  every minute encreased, her eye rolled, with restless anxiety, every where,  except to meet his, and so little were her thoughts, looks, or conversation  bestowed upon her partner, that instead of finding the animated beauty who had  nearly captivated him on board the yacht, he seemed coupled with a fair  lifeless machine, whom the music, perforce, put in motion; and relinquished her  hand with as little reluctance as she withdrew it.  Melmond had again, by his sister, been forced into the party, though with added  unwillingness, from his new idea of Indiana. Now, however, to avoid that fair  bane was impossible: Indiana was the first object to meet every eye, from the  lustre of her beauty, and the fineness of her figure, each more than ever  transcendently conspicuous, from the uniform which had obliged every other  female in the room to appear in exactly the same attire. Yet great and  unrivalled as was the admiration which she met, what came simply and naturally  was insufficient for the thirst with which she now quaffed this intoxicating  beverage; and to render its draughts still more delicious, she made Eugenia  always hold by her arm. The contrast here to the spectators was diverting as  well as striking, and renewed attention to her own charms, when the eye began  to grow nearly sated with gazing. The ingenuous Eugenia, incapable of  suspecting such a design, was always the dupe to the request, from the opinion  it was made in kindness, to save her from fatigue in the eternal sauntering of  a public place; and, lost to all fear, in being lost to all hope, as to her own  appearance, cheerfully accompanied her beautiful kinswoman, without  conjecturing that, in a company whence the illiterate and vulgar were excluded,  personal imperfections could excite pleasantry, or be a subject of satire.  Camilla, who still saw nothing of Edgar, yet still thought it possible he might  come, joined them as soon as she was able. Miss Margland was full of complaints  about Dr. Orkborne, for his affording them no assistance in the yacht, and not  coming home even to dinner, nor to attend them to Lord Pervil's; and Eugenia,  who was sincerely attached to the Doctor, from the many years he had been her  preceptor, was beginning to express her serious uneasiness at his thus  strangely vanishing; when Clermont, with the most obstreperous laughter, made  up to them, and said: 'I'll tell you a monstrous good joke! the best thing you  ever heard in your life! the old Doctor's been upon the very point of being  drowned!—and he has not had a morsel to eat all day!'  He then related that his man, having seen him composedly seated, and musing  upon a pile of planks which were seasoning upon the beach, with his face turned  away from the company to avoid its interruptions, had enquired if he had any  commands at home, whither he was going: 'Not for meaning to do them,' continued  Lynmere; 'No, no! catch Bob at that! but only to break in upon him; for Bob's a  rare hand at a joke. He says he's ready to die with laughing, when he speaks to  the old Doctor while he's studying, because he looks so much as if he wished we  were all hanged. However, he answered tolerably civilly, and only desired that  nobody might go into his room till he came home from the sail, for he'd forgot  to lock it. So Bob, who smoked how the matter was, says: 'The sail, Sir, what  are you going alone, then? for all the company's been gone these two hours.' So  this put him in such a taking, Bob says he never laughed so much in his life.  He jumped up as if he'd been bit: 'Gone?' says he, 'why where's Miss Eugenia, I  promised Sir Hugh not to lose sight of her.' So he said he'd go after her that  very moment. 'Call me a boat,' said he: just as if he'd ordered a hackney  coach; for he knows about as much of winds and tides as my little bay Filly,  that I bought of Halder yesterday for fifty pounds, but that I shall make worth  seventy in less than a month. Well, there was nothing to be had but a small  fishing boat, so Bob winks at the man to take in a friend; for he has all those  fellows in a string. So in went his Latinship, and off they put. Bob fell into  such a fit of laughter, he says I might have heard him a mile off. I don't  think Bob has his fellow upon earth for fun.'  Eugenia now interrupted the narration, with a serious enquiry where Dr.  Orkborne was at present.  Lynmere, shouting at what he thought the ridicule of this concern, answered,  that Bob had told the fisherman to go about his own business, unless the Doctor  offered to pay him handsomely for taking him on board the yacht; but thinking  it would be a good joke to know what was become of him, he had gone himself,  with Halder, and some more choice blades, to the beach, about half an hour ago,  to make Bob see if the fishing boat was come in; and, by good luck, they  arrived at the very nick of time, and saw the Doctor, the fish, and the  fishing-tackle, all hauled out together. 'And a better sight was never seen  before, I promise you!' continued Lynmere; 'I thought I should quite have burst  my sides with looking at him, he was so wet and so cold, and so miserable; and  when I thought of his having had no dinner, I shouted till I was ready to roll  on the beach—and he smelt so of the fish, that I could have hugged Bob, 'twas  such monstrous good sport. He got three half crowns in a minute for his  ingenuity. Halder began;—and two others of us gave two more.'  'Poor Dr. Orkborne! and where is he now?' said Eugenia.  'Why we got about the fisherman, and then we had all the same fun over again:  He says, that, at first, the poor gentleman was in a great taking, fretting and  fuming, and looking out for the yacht, and seeming almost beside himself for  hurry to get to it; but after that, he takes out a little red book and a  pencil, and falls to writing, just as hard as if he'd come into the boat for  nothing else; insomuch, that when they were just coming along-side the yacht,  he never lifted up his head, nor listened to one word, but kept making a motion  with his hand to be let alone: and when the man said the yacht would be passed,  he bid him hold his peace, and not interrupt him so, in such a pettish manner,  that the man resolved to take honest Bob's advice, and go on about his own  business. And so he did, and the Doctor was as content as a lord, till he had  scribbled all he could scratch out of his noddle: but then came the best sport  of all; for when he had nothing more to write, and looked up, and saw the boat  stock still, and the man fishing at his leisure, and heard the yacht had been  bound homeward of a good hour, he was in such a perilous passion, the man says,  that he actually thought he'd have jumped overboard. I'll bet what you will he  won't ask Bob to call him a boat again in a hurry.'  'As to his behaviour,' said Miss Margland, 'it's the last thing in the world to  surprize me, after what I have seen myself; nor any body else, I believe,  neither. Who is Dr. Orkborne? I doubt much if any body ever heard his name  before. I should like to know if any body can tell who was his grandfather!'  She then declared, if she could get any soul to fetch him, he should still  come, if it were only that he might not pass the evening all in his own way,  which would be just the thing to encourage him to hide himself out of sight, on  purpose not to help them another time.  Eugenia was going to beg he might not be disturbed, when Melmond, all alacrity  to seize any means of absenting himself from the two cousins, who produced in  him so severe a conflict, offered his services to carry a message to the  Doctor; which, being readily accepted, he set off.  Indiana and Eugenia, not wholly without similarity of sensation, looked after  him. Indiana had now caught his eye; and though quickness was no part of her  character, the tale it told had convinced her that her power, though no longer  acknowledged was not extinguished; it required neither elemental precepts, nor  sagacious perceptions, to make this discovery, and she exultingly determined to  appease her late mortification, by reducing him to her feet. She stopt not to  enquire what such a step might be to Eugenia, nor what was likely, or even  desirable to be its event. Where narrow minds imagine they have received  injury, they seek revenge rather than redress, from an opinion that such a  conduct asserts their own importance.  Still vainly, and wretchedly, the eyes of Camilla sought Edgar: the evening  advanced, but he came not; yet, catching at every possible chance for hope, she  thought some other room that they had not visited, might be open for company,  where, finally, they might meet.  Dr. Orkborne accompanied Melmond back. Miss Margland was preparing him a  reproachful reception, but was so much offended by the fishy smell which he  brought into the room, that she had immediate recourse to her salts, and  besought him to stand out of her way. He complied without reluctance, though  with high disdain.  The young ladies were all dancing. Indiana had no sooner perceived Melmond,  than she determined to engage his attention: the arts of coquetry require but  slender parts, where the love of admiration is potent; she pretended,  therefore, to feel extremely ill, put her hand to her forehead, and telling her  partner, Mr. Halder, she could not stand another minute, hastened to Miss  Margland, and cast herself, as if fainting, upon her neck.  This had all the success with Melmond that his own lively imagination could  give it. He flew to a side-table to get her a glass of water, which his  trembling hand could scarce hold, but which she received from him with a  languishing sweetness, that dissolved every tie but of love, and he 'hung over  her enamoured[4];' while Miss Margland related that she could hardly keep from  fainting herself, so much she had been shocked and disordered by the horrid  smell of Dr. Orkborne.  Indiana now caught the infection, and protested she was so much worse, that if  she had not a little air she should die. Melmond was flying to open a window,  but a lady who sat close to it, objected; and he had then recourse to two  folding doors, leading to a portico open to a large garden.  Hither Indiana permitted herself to be led, and led by the thrice happy, yet  thrice miserable Melmond. Miss Margland was accompanying them, but Lady Pervil,  advancing to enquire what went wrong, gave her an opportunity irresistible to  inveigh against Dr. Orkborne; and as her well-bred hearer, though little  interested in such a detail, would not interrupt it, Indiana arrived alone in  the portico with Melmond. Halder, who had danced with her, followed, but  supposing Melmond the favoured man, walked singing off, and made the tour of  the garden.  This situation was to Melmond as dangerous, as to Indiana it was exulting. She  now suddenly withdrew her hand, with an air of poignant disdain, which the  illuminated portico and house made amply visible; and when, surprised and much  moved, he tremblingly enquired if she were worse, she answered, 'Why do you  ask? I am sure you do not care.'  Easily deprived of all forbearance, 'Heavens!' he exclaimed, 'do I live, yet  suffer this imputation! O divine Indiana! load me with every other reproach,  rather than this dreadful charge of insensibility to all that is most lovely,  most perfect upon earth!'  'I thought,' said Indiana, again softening her fine eyes, 'you had quite forgot  me, and all the vows you made to me.'  'Wretch that I am,' cried Melmond nearly distracted by this charge, and by the  regret at losing him, which seemed its purpose, 'condemned to every species of  woe! O fair, angelic Indiana! in a cottage with you would I have dwelt, more  delightedly, and more proudly, than any potentate in the most gorgeous palace:  but, alas! from you—formed to enchant all mankind, and add grace to every  dignity—from you could I dare ask such a sacrifice?'  Indiana now listened with an attentive softness no longer factitious; though  all her views wafted her to splendour and high life, her ear could not  withstand the romantic sound of love and a cottage; and though no character was  ever less formed to know and taste the blessings such a spot may bestow and  reciprocate, she imagined she might there be happy, for she considered such a  habitation but as a bower of eglantine and roses, in which she might repose and  be adored all day long.  Melmond saw but too quickly the relenting cast of her countenance; and ecstasy  and despair combated which should bear sway in his breast. 'Ah, madam,' he  cried, 'most adorable and most adored of women! you know my terrible situation,  but you know not the sufferings, nor the constancy of my heart!—the  persecution of friends, the pressure of distress, the hopelessness of my  idolized Indiana—'  A deep sigh interrupted him—it came not from Indiana—startled, he looked  round—and beheld Eugenia, leaning against the door by which she seemed to  have intended entering, pale, petrified, aghast.  Shame now tied his tongue, and tingled, with quick reproach, through his whole  frame. He looked at Indiana with despair, at Eugenia with remorse; injured  rectitude and blushing honour urged him to the swiftest termination of so every  way terrible a scene, and bowing low to Eugenia, 'I durst not, madam,' he  cried, 'ever hope for your pardon! yet I rather deluded myself than deceived  you when I ventured to solicit your acceptance. Alas! I am a bankrupt both in  fortune and in heart, and can only pray you will hasten to forget—that you  may forbear to execrate me!'  He then disappeared, finding a way out by the garden, to avoid re-entering the  ball-room.  Eugenia, who, in this speech, comprehended an eternal adieu, sunk upon the seat  of the portico, cold, shivering, almost lifeless. Little prepared for such an  event, she had followed Indiana the moment she was disengaged from the dance,  not suspicious of any tête-à-tête, from believing Halder of the party. The  energy of Melmond made her approach unheard; and the words she unavoidably  caught, nearly turned her to marble.  Indiana was sorry for her distress, yet felt a triumph in its cause; and  wondered how so plain a little creature could take it into her head to think of  marrying.  Camilla now joined them, affrighted at the evident anguish of Eugenia, who,  leaning upon her affectionate bosom, had the relief excited by pity, of  bursting into tears, while despondingly she uttered: 'All is over, my sister,  and over for life with Eugenia! Melmond flies and detests me! I am odious in  his sight! I am horror to this thoughts!'  Camilla wept over her in silent, but heart-breaking sympathy. Indiana returned  to the dance: but the two suffering sisters remained in the portico till  summoned to depart. They were insensible to the night air, from the fever of  their minds. They spoke no more; they felt the insufficiency of words to  express their griefs, and their mutual compassion was all that softened their  mutual sorrows.
