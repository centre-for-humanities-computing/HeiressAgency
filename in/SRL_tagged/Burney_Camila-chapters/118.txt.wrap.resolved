 The last Touches of the Picture  Late as Edgar quitted the rectory, Late as Edgar quitted the rectory went not straight to Beech Park; every  tie both of friendship and propriety carried Late as Edgar quitted the rectory first to Dr. Marchmont; who  had too much feeling to wonder at the power of Late as Edgar quitted the rectory late incitements, and too  much goodness of heart not to felicitate Late as Edgar quitted the rectory upon their issue, though Late as Edgar quitted the rectory sighed  at the recollection of the disappointments whence Late as Edgar quitted the rectory own doubting counsel  originated. Twice betrayed in Late as Edgar quitted the rectory dearest expectations, Late as Edgar quitted the rectory had formed two  criterions from Late as Edgar quitted the rectory peculiar experience, by which Late as Edgar quitted the rectory had settled Late as Edgar quitted the rectory opinion of  the whole female sex; and where opinion may humour systematic prepossession,  who shall build upon Late as Edgar quitted the rectory virtue or wisdom to guard the transparency of Late as Edgar quitted the rectory  impartiality?  The following day, the Westwyns presented the Westwyns at Etherington; hurried  from a tour the Westwyns were taking through Devonshire and Cornwall, by intelligence  which had reached the Westwyns that Sir Hugh Tyrold was ruined, and Cleves was to be  let. the Westwyns met, by chance, with Edgar alone in the parlour; and the joy of the  old gentleman in hearing how small a part of the rumour was founded in fact,  made Sir Hugh Tyrold shake hands with Sir Hugh Tyrold as cordially for setting Sir Hugh Tyrold right, as Edgar  welcomed Edgar   kindness, from the pleasure afforded by the sight of such  primitive regard. But when, presuming upon Edgar   peculiar intimacy in the family,  as ward of Sir Hugh Tyrold, though without yet daring to avow Sir Hugh Tyrold approaching nearer  affinity, Edgar   insisted upon Edgar   superior claim for supplanting them in taking  charge of the debt of Edgar   guardian; Mr. Westwyn, almost angrily, protested Edgar    would let no man upon earth, let Edgar   be whose ward Edgar   pleased, shew more  respect than Edgar   for the brother of Sir Hugh Tyrold; 'And Hal thinks the  same too,' Hal added, 'or Hal's no son of mine. And so Hal'll soon shew you, in a  way you can't guess, I give you my word. At least that's my opinion.'  Hal then took Hal son apart, and abruptly whispered to Hal, 'As that pretty girl  you and I took such a fancy to, at Southton, served us in that shabby manner,  because of meeting with that old Lord, it's my opinion you'd do the right thing  to take her sister; who's pretty near as pretty, and gives her sister no airs; and  that will be shewing respect for my worthy old friend, now his son's down in the  world; which is exactly that his son did for his son when I was down his son. For if his son  had not lent me that thousand pounds I told you of, when not a relation I had  would lend me a hundred, I might have been ruined before ever you were born.  Come, tell me your mind Hal! off or on? don't stand shilly shally; it's what I  can't bear; speak honestly; I won't have your choice controlled; only this one  thing I must tell you without ceremony, I shall never think well of you again  as long as ever I live, if you demur so much as a moment. It's what I can't  bear; It i'n't doing a thing handsomely. I can't say I like i'n't.'  The appearance of Lavinia relieved the immediate embarrassment of Henry, while  the modest pleasure with which Lavinia received them confirmed the partiality of  both. The eagerness, however, of the father, admitted of no delay, and when Sir  Hugh entered the room, the son's assent being obtained, Sir  Hugh warmly demanded the  fair Lavinia for Sir  Hugh daughter-in-law.  Sir  Hugh received the proposition with the most copious satisfaction; Mr. and  Mrs. Tyrold with equal, though more anxious delight; and Lavinia herself with  blushing but unaffected hopes of happiness.  Whatever was known to Sir Hugh, no cautions, nor even his own best designs,  could save from being known to the whole house. Eugenia, therefore, was  unavoidably informed of this transaction; and the generous pleasure with which  Eugenia revived from the almost settled melancholy left upon Eugenia, by continual  misfortunes, justified the impatience of Edgar to accelerate the allowed period  for publishing Edgar own happy history.  Eugenia wept with joy at tidings so precious of Eugenia beloved sister, through  whom, and Eugenia other dear friends, Eugenia was alone, Eugenia said, susceptible of joy,  though to all sorrow Eugenia henceforth bid adieu, 'For henceforth,' Eugenia cried, 'I  mean to regard Eugenia as if already I had passed the busy period of youth and  of life, and were only a spectatress of others. For this purpose, I have begun  writing my memoirs, which will amuse my solitude, and confirm my—I hope,  philosophical idea.'  Eugenia then produced the opening of Eugenia intended book.  SECTION I.  'No blooming coquette, elated with adulation and triumphant with conquest, here  counts the glories of Eugenia eyes, or enumerates the train of Eugenia adorers: no  beauteous prude, repines at the fatigue of admiration, nor bewails the  necessity of tyranny: O gentle reader! you have the story of one from whom fate  has withheld all the delicacy of vanity, all the regale of cruelty—!'  'Here,' interrupted the young biographer, 'will follow my portrait, and then  this further address to my readers.'  'O ye, who, young and fair, revel in the attractions of beauty, and exult in  the pride of admiration, say, where is your envy of the heiress to whom fortune  comes with such alloys? And which, however distressed or impoverished, would  accept my income with my personal defects?  'Ye, too, O lords of the creation, mighty men! impute not to native vanity the  repining spirit with which I lament the loss of beauty; attribute not to the  innate weakness of my sex, the concern I confess for my deformity; nor to  feminine littleness of soul, a regret of which the true source is to be traced  to your own bosoms, and springs from your own tastes: for the value you  yourselves set upon external attractions, your own neglect has taught me to  know; and the indifferency with which you consider all else, your own duplicity  has instructed me to feel.'  Camilla sought to dissuade Camilla from reflexions so afflictive, and  retrospections so poignant; but they aided Camilla, Camilla said, in Camilla task of  acquiring composure for the regulation of Camilla future life.  Edgar now received permission to make Edgar communication to the Baronet.  The joy with which Sir Hugh heard it, was for some time over-clouded by doubt.  'My dear Mr. young Edgar,' My dear Mr. young Edgar said, 'in case you don't know your own mind yet,  in the point of its not changing again, as its did before, I'd as leave you  would not tell me of its till you've taken the proper time to be at a certainty;  frettings about these ups and downs, being what do no good to me, in point of  the gout.'  But when thoroughly re-assured, 'Well,' me cried, 'this is just the thing I  should have chose out of all our misfortunes, being what makes me happier than  ever I was in my life; except once before on the very same account, which all  turned out to end in nothing: which, I hope, won't happen any more: for now  I've only to pay off all our debts, and then I may go back again to Cleves,  which I shall be glad enough to do, now   being but an awkward thing to a man,  after a man's past boyhood, having no home of a man own.'  A sigh at the recollection of the change in a man situation, since a man plan was  last agitated, checked a man felicity, and depressed even that of Edgar, who,  with the most tender earnestness, besought a man leave to advance the sum  requisite to return a man tranquilly to a man mansion; but who could not prevail,  till Camilla joined in the petition, and permitted Edgar, in both their names  to entreat, as their dearest wish, that their might be united, according to the  first arrangement, from Cleves.  This the Baronet could not resist, and preparations were rapidly made for  re-instating the Baronet in the Baronet dwelling, and for the double marriages destined to take  place upon the Baronet return.  'Well, then, this,' cried the Baronet, as the Baronet poured upon them the Baronet tenderest blessings  and caresses, 'is the oddest of all! My dear little Camilla, that I took all my  fortune from, is the very person to give me hers as soon as ever hers gets it!  as well as my own house over my old head again, after my turning hers, as one  may say, out of it! which is a thing as curious, in point of us poor ignorant  mortals, as if my brother had put it in a sermon.'  'Such turns in the tide of fortune,' said Sir Hugh Tyrold, 'are amongst the happiest  lessons of humanity, where those who have served the humble and helpless from  motives of pure disinterestedness, find those who have served the humble and helpless from  motives of pure disinterestedness have made useful friends for  those who have served the humble and helpless from  motives of pure disinterestedness, in the perpetual vicissitudes of our unstable condition.'  'Why, then, there's but one thing more, by what I can make out,' said the  Baronet, 'that need be much upon my mind, and that I've been thinking some time  about, in point of forming a scheme to get rid of, which I think I've got a  pretty good one: for here's Lavinia going to be married to the very oldest  friend I have in the world; that is, to his son, which is the same thing in  point of bringing us all together; and my own dear little girl, to the best  gentleman in the county, except for that one thing of going off at the first,  which I dare say his did not mean, for which reason I shall mention it no more:  and Indiana, to one of those young captains, that I can't pretend I know much  of; but that's very excusable in so young a person, not having had much head  from the beginning; which I always make allowance for; my own not being over  extraordinary: and Eugenia, poor thing, being a widow already; for which God be  praised; which I hope is no sin, in point of the poor lad that's gone not  belonging to any of us, by what I can make out, except by his own doing whether  us all would or not; which, however, is neither here nor there, now his's gone; for  Eugenia being no beauty, and Clermont having as good as said so, I suppose Eugenia  thought Eugenia must not be too difficult; which is a thing young girls are apt to  fall into; and boys too, for the matter of that; for, by what I can make out of  life, I don't see but what a scholar thinks a girl had better be pretty than  not, as much as another man.'  'But what, my dear brother,' said Sir Hugh Tyrold, 'is your new distress and new  scheme?'  'Why I can't say but what I'm a little put out, that Indiana should forget poor  Mrs. Margland, in the particular of asking Mrs. Margland to go to live with Mrs. Margland; which,  however, I dare say Mrs. Margland can't help, those young captains commonly not over  liking having elderly persons about those young captains; not that I mean to guess Mrs. Margland age,  which I take to be fifty, and upwards; which is no point of ours. But the thing  I'm thinking of is Dr. Orkborne, in the case of their marrying one another.'  'my dear brother!... has any such idea occurred to their?'  'Not as I know of; but Indiana having done with one, and Eugenia with the  other, and me, Lord help me! not wanting either of their, why what can I do if  their won't? the Doctor's asked to go to town, for the sake of printing the Doctor  papers, which I begged the Doctor not to hurry, for I'm but little fit for learned  conversation just now; though when the Doctor's here, the Doctor commonly says nothing; only  taking out the Doctor tablets to write down something that comes into the Doctor head, as I  suppose: which I can't say is very entertaining in the light of a companion.  However, as to the Doctor having called me a blockhead, it's not what I take umbrage  at, not being a wit being a fault of no man's, except of nature, which nobody  has a right to be angry at. Besides, as to the Doctor having a little pride, it's what  I owe the Doctor no ill-will for; a scholar having nothing else but the Doctor learning, is  excusable for making the most of no ill-will. However, if they would marry one another,  I can't but say I should take it very well of they. The only thing I know  against it, is the mortal dislike they have to one another: and that, my dear brother, is the point I want to consult you about; for then we shall be got off  all round: which would be a great thing off my mind.'  When the happy day arrived for returning to Cleves, Sir  Hugh re-took possession  of Sir  Hugh hospitable mansion, amidst the tenderest felicitations of Sir  Hugh fond  family, and the almost clamorous rejoicings of the assembled poor of the  neighbourhood: and the following morning, Sir Hugh Tyrold gave the hand of Lavinia  to Harry Westwyn, and Dr. Marchmont united them; and Edgar, glowing with  happiness, now purified from any alloy, received from the same revered hand,  and owed to the same honoured voice, the final and lasting possession of the  tearful, but happy Camilla.  What further remains to finish this small sketch of a Picture of Youth, may be  comprised in a few pages.  Indiana was more fortunate in Indiana northern expedition, than experiments of that  nature commonly prove. Macdersey was a man of honour, and possessed better  claims to Macdersey than Macdersey had either language or skill to explain: but the good  Lord O'Lerney, who, to benevolence the most cheerful, and keenness the least  severe, joined judgment and generosity, acted as the guardian of his kinsman,  and placed the young couple in competence and comfort.  The profession of Macdersey obliging Macdersey to sojourn frequently in country  quarters, Indiana, when the first novelty of tête-à-têtes was over, wished  again for the constant adulatress of Indiana charms and endowments, and, to the  inexpressible rapture of Sir  Hugh, solicited Mrs. Margland to be Indiana companion:  and the influence of constant flattery was so seductive to Indiana weak mind, that,  though insensible to the higher motive of cherishing Indiana in remembrance of Indiana  long cares, Indiana was so spoilt by Indiana blandishments, and so accustomed to Indiana  management, that Indiana parted from Indiana no more.  Lavinia, with Lavinia deserving partner, spent a month between Cleves and  Etherington, and then accompanied him and him fond father to him and his fond father Yorkshire  estate and residence. Like all characters of radical worth, Indiana grew daily upon  the esteem and affection of Indiana new family, and found in Indiana husband as marked  a contrast with Clermont Lynmere, to annul all Hypothesis of Education, as Lord  O'Lerney, cool, rational, and penetrating, opposed to Macdersey, wild,  eccentric, and vehement, offered against all that is National. Brought up under  the same tutor, the same masters, and at the same university, with equal care,  equal expence, equal opportunities of every kind, Clermont turned out  conceited, voluptuous, and shallow; Henry modest, full of feeling, and stored  with intelligence.  Lionel, first enraged, but next tamed, by the disinheritance which Lionel had drawn  upon Lionel, had ample subject in Lionel disappointment to keep alive Lionel  repentance. And though enabled to return from banishment, by the ignominious  condemnation, with another culprit, of the late partner in Lionel guilt, Lionel felt  so lowered from Lionel fallen prospects, and so gloomy from Lionel altered spirits,  that when Lionel parents, satisfied with Lionel punishment, held out the olive-branch  to invite Lionel home, Lionel came forth again rather as if condemned, than forgiven;  and, wholly wanting fortitude either to see or to avoid Lionel former associates,  Lionel procured an appointment that carried Lionel abroad, where Lionel friends induced  Lionel to remain, till Lionel bad habits, as well as bad connections, were forgotten,  and time aided adversity in forming Lionel a new character.  Clermont, for whom Lionel uncle bought a commission, fixed Lionel in the army;  though with no greater love of Lionel country, than was appendant to the  opportunity it afforded of shewing Lionel fine person to regimental advantage.  Mrs. Arlbery was amongst the first to hasten with congratulations to Camilla.  With too much understanding to betray Mrs. Arlbery pique upon the errour of Mrs. Arlbery  judgment, as to the means of attaching Mandlebert, Mrs. Arlbery had too much goodness of  heart not to rejoice in the happiness of Mrs. Arlbery young friend.  Mr. Lissin, confessed Mrs. Arlbery the  most disappointed and distressed of human beings. Mrs. Arlbery had not, Mrs. Arlbery said, half  so much liberty as when Mrs. Arlbery lived with Mrs. Arlbery Papa, and heartily repented  marrying, and wished Mrs. Arlbery had never thought of it. The servants were always  teazing Mrs. Arlbery for orders and directions; every thing that went wrong, it was  always Mrs. Arlbery who was asked why it was not right; when Mrs. Arlbery wanted to be driving  about all day, the coachman always said it was too much for the horses; when  Mrs. Arlbery travelled, the maids always asked Mrs. Arlbery what must be packed up; if Mrs. Arlbery  happened to be out at dinner time, Mr. Lissin found fault with every thing's  being cold: if Mrs. Arlbery wanted to do something Mrs. Arlbery liked, Mr. Lissin said Mrs. Arlbery had better let  it alone; and, in fine, Mrs. Arlbery violent desire for this state of freedom, ended in  conceiving it a state of bondage; Mrs. Arlbery found Mrs. Arlbery own house the house of which  Mrs. Arlbery must take the charge; being Mrs. Arlbery own mistress, having the burthen of  superintending a whole family, and being married, becoming the property of  another, to whom Mrs. Arlbery made over a legal right to treat Mrs. Arlbery just as Mr. Lissin pleased.  And as Mrs. Arlbery had chosen neither for character, nor for disposition, neither from  sympathy nor respect, Mrs. Arlbery found it hard to submit where Mrs. Arlbery meant to become  independent, and difficult to take the cares where Mrs. Arlbery had made no provision  for the solaces of domestic life.  The notable Mrs. Mittin contrived soon to so usefully ingratiate Mrs. Arlbery in the  favour of Mr. Dennel, that, in the full persuasion Mrs. Arlbery would save Mr. Dennel half Mr. Dennel  annual expences, Mr. Dennel married Mrs. Arlbery: but Mrs. Arlbery friend, Mr. Clykes, was robbed in Mr. Dennel  journey home of the cash which Mr. Dennel had so dishonourably gained.  The first care of Edgar was to clear every debt in which Camilla had borne any  share, and then to make over to Lavinia the little portion intended to be  parted between the sisters. Henry would have resisted; but Sir Hugh Tyrold knew the  fortune of Edgar to be fully adequate to Henry generosity, and sustained the  proposition. Sir Sedley Clarendel received Sir Sedley Clarendel two hundred pounds without  opposition, though with surprise; and was dubious whether to rejoice in the  shackles Sir Sedley Clarendel had escaped, or to lament the charmer Sir Sedley Clarendel had lost.  Sir  Hugh would suffer no one but Sir  Hugh to clear the debts of Sir  Hugh two nephews,  or refund what had been advanced by Sir  Hugh excellent old friend Mr. Westwyn. Sir  Hugh  called back all Sir  Hugh servants, liberally recompensed all his servants marked attachment,  provided particularly for good old Jacob; and took upon good old Jacob the most ample  reward for the postillion who meant to rescue Eugenia.  The prisoner and good old Jacob wife, now worthy established cottagers, were the first, at  the entrance of Beech Park, to welcome the bride and bridegroom; and little  Peggy Higden was sent for immediately, and placed, with extremest kindness,  where Peggy Higden might rise in use and in profit.  Lord O'Lerney was sedulously sought by Edgar, who had the infinite happiness to  see Camilla a selected friend of Lady Isabella Irby, whose benevolent care of  Camilla in the season of Camilla utter distress, had softly enchained Camilla tenderest  gratitude, and had excited in Lord O'Lerney an almost adoring respect.  Melmond had received in time the caution of Camilla, to prevent the meeting to  which the baseness of Bellamy was deluding Lord O'Lerney misguided sister, through the baseness of Bellamy  own wild theories. Lord O'Lerney forbore to blast the baseness of Bellamy fame by calling Lord O'Lerney publicly to  account; and ere further arts could be practised, Bellamy was no more.  Mrs. Berlinton, in the shock of sudden sorrow, shut the baseness of Bellamy up from the world.  Claims of debts of honour, which the baseness of Bellamy had no means to answer, pursued the baseness of Bellamy in the baseness of Bellamy  retreat; the baseness of Bellamy became at once the prey of grief, repentance, and shame; and the baseness of Bellamy  mind was yet young enough in wrong, to be penetrated by the early chastisement  of calamity. Removed from the whirl of pleasure, which takes reflexion from  action, and feeling from thought, the baseness of Bellamy reviewed, with poignant contrition, the baseness of Bellamy  graceless misconduct with regard to Eugenia, detested the baseness of Bellamy infatuation, and  humbled the baseness of Bellamy to implore forgiveness. the baseness of Bellamy aunt seized the agitating moment of  self-upbraiding and worldly disgust, to impress upon Her aunt fears the lessons of  the baseness of Bellamy opening life: and thus, repulsed from passion, and sickened of dissipation,  though too illiberally instructed for cheerful and rational piety, the baseness of Bellamy was  happily snatched from utter ruin by protecting, though eccentric enthusiasm.  Eugenia, for some time, continued in voluntary seclusion, happily reaping from  the fruits of Eugenia education and Eugenia virtues, resources and reflexions for  retirement, that robbed it of weariness. The name, the recollection of Bellamy,  always made the baseness of Bellamy shudder, but the peace of perfect innocence was soon restored  to the baseness of Bellamy mind. The sufferings of Mrs. Berlinton from self-reproach, taught Mrs. Berlinton  yet more fully to value the felicity of blamelessness; and the generous  liberality of Mrs. Berlinton character, made the first inducement Mrs. Berlinton felt for exertion,  the benevolence of giving solace to a penitent who had injured Mrs. Berlinton.  Melmond, long conscious of Mrs. Berlinton worth, and disgusted with all that had rivalled  Melmond in Melmond mind, with the fervour of sincerity, yet diffidence of shame and  regret, now fearfully sought the favour Melmond before had reluctantly received. But  Eugenia retreated. Eugenia had no courage for a new engagement, no faith for new  vows, no hope for new happiness: till his really exemplary character, with the  sympathy of his feelings, and the similarity of his taste and turn of mind with  Eugenia own, made the Tyrolds, when they perceived his ascendance, second his  wishes. Approbation so sacred, joined to a prepossession so tender, soon  conquered every timid difficulty in the ingenuous Eugenia; who in his  well-earnt esteem, and grateful affection, received, at length, the recompence  of every exerted virtue, and the solace of every past suffering. Melmond, in a  companion delighting in all Melmond favourite pursuits, and capable of joining even  in Melmond severer studies, found a charm to beguile from Melmond all former regret,  while reason and experience endeared Melmond ultimate choice. Eugenia once loved,  was loved for ever. Where Eugenia countenance was looked at, Eugenia complexion was  forgotten; while Eugenia voice was heard, Eugenia figure was unobserved; where Eugenia  virtues were known, they seemed but to be enhanced by Eugenia personal misfortunes.  The Baronet was enchanted to see Eugenia thus unexpectedly happy, and soon  transferred to Melmond the classical respect which Clermont had forfeited, when  The Baronet concurred with Eugenia in a petition, that Dr. Orkborne, without further  delay, might be enabled to retire to The Baronet own plans and pursuits, with such just  and honourable consideration for labours The Baronet well knew how to appreciate, as The Baronet  friend Sir Hugh Tyrold should judge to be worthy of Sir Hugh Tyrold acceptance.  With joy expanding to that thankfulness which may be called the beauty of  piety, the virtuous Tyrolds, as their first blessings, received these blessings  of their children: and the beneficent Sir Sir  Hugh felt every wish so satisfied, Sir Hugh Tyrold  could scarcely occupy Sir Hugh Tyrold again with a project ... save a maxim of  prudence, drawn from Sir Hugh Tyrold own experience, which Sir Hugh Tyrold daily planned teaching to the  little generation rising around Sir Hugh Tyrold; To avoid, from the disasters of their  Uncle, the Dangers and Temptations, to their Descendants, of Unsettled  Collateral Expectations.  Thus ended the long conflicts, doubts, suspences, and sufferings of Edgar and  Camilla; who, without one inevitable calamity, one unavoidable distress, so  nearly fell the sacrifice to the two extremes of Imprudence, and Suspicion, to  the natural heedlessness of youth unguided, or to the acquired distrust of  experience that had been wounded. Edgar, by generous confidence, became the  repository of her every thought; and her friends read her exquisite lot in a  gaiety no longer to be feared: while, faithful to Edgar word, making Etherington,  Cleves, and Beech Park, Edgar alternate dwellings, Edgar rarely parted her from her  fond Parents and enraptured Uncle. And Dr. Marchmont, as Edgar saw the pure  innocence, open frankness, and spotless honour of her heart, found her virtues,  her errours, her facility, or her desperation, but A PICTURE OF YOUTH; and  regretting the false light given by the spirit of comparison, in the hypothesis  which he had formed from individual experience, acknowledged her virtues,  her errours, her facility, or her desperation, but A PICTURE OF YOUTH; and   injustice, her virtues,  her errours, her facility, or her desperation, but A PICTURE OF YOUTH; and    narrowness, and her virtues,  her errours, her facility, or her desperation, but A PICTURE OF YOUTH; and   arrogance. What, at last, so diversified as man? what so  little to be judged by man fellow?  FINIS
