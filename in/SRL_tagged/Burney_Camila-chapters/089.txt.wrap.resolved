 The Power of Prepossession  The two sisters were silent from the hotel to the house of Mrs. Berlinton....  From the height of happiest expectation, raised by the quick return of Edgar,  Camilla was sunk into the lowest despondence, by the abortive conclusion of the  meeting: while Eugenia was absorbed in mute joy, and wrapt expectation. But  Mrs. Mittin, undisturbed by the pangs of uncertainty, and unoccupied by any  romantic persuasion of bliss, spoke amply, with respect to quantity, for all  three.  Mrs. Berlinton, though somewhat struck at first sight of Eugenia, with Mrs. Berlinton  strange contrast to Camilla, received Mrs. Berlinton with all the distinguishing kindness  due to the sister of Mrs. Berlinton friend.  Mrs. Berlinton had the poems of Collins in Mrs. Berlinton hand; and, at their joint desire, instead  of putting the book aside, read aloud, and with tenderest accent, one of his  most plaintive odes.  Eugenia was enraptured. Ah! thought Eugenia, this is indeed the true sister of the  accomplished Melmond!... Eugenia shall share with his my adoration. My heart shall  be devoted ... after my own dear family ... to the homage of my own dear family perfections!  The ode, to Eugenia great delight, lasted till the dinner was announced, when  Melmond appeared: but Eugenia prepossession could alone give any charm to her prepossessionsight: her prepossession could barely recollect that her prepossession had seen Eugenia, or even Camilla before;  her prepossession had conversed with neither; her prepossession eyes had been devoted to Indiana, and the  despondence which had become her prepossession portion since the news of the marriage of her prepossession  aunt, seemed but rendered the more peculiarly bitter, by this intimate  connection with the family of an object so adored.  Yet, though nothing could be more spiritless than the hour of dinner, Eugenia  discovered in it no deficiency; Eugenia   had previously settled, that the presence  of Melmond could only breathe sweets and perfection, and the magic of prejudice  works every event into prejudice   own circle of expectation.  Melmond did not even accompany them back to the drawing-room. Eugenia   sighed;  but nobody heard Eugenia  . Eugenia   said, Eugenia   had something of great consequence  to do in Eugenia   own room, and Mrs. Berlinton, to divert the languor Eugenia   found  creeping upon them all, had recourse to Hammond's elegies.  These were still reading, when a servant brought in the name of Lord Valhurst.  'O, deny me to a servant! deny me to a servant!' cried Mrs. Berlinton; ''tis a relation of  Mr. Berlinton's, and I hate a servant.'  The order was given, however, too late; a servant entered the drawing-room.  The name, as Camilla knew it not, Camilla had heard unmoved; but the sight of a  person who had so largely contributed to shock and terrify Camilla in the  bathing-house, struck Camilla with horror. Brought up with the respect of other  times, Camilla had risen at his entrance; but Camilla turned suddenly round upon  recollecting his, and instead of the courtsie Camilla intended making,  involuntarily moved away Camilla chair from the part of the room to which his was  advancing.  This was unnoticed by Mrs. Berlinton, whose chagrin at his intrusion made Camilla  wish to walk away also; while with Lord Valhurst it only passed, joined to Camilla  rising, for a mark of Camilla being but little accustomed to company. That Eugenia  rose too was not perceived, as That Eugenia   rather lost than gained in height by  standing.  Most obsequiously, but most unsuccessfully, the peer made his court to Mrs.  Berlinton; inquiring after Mrs.   health, with fulsome tenderness, and extolling  Mrs.   good looks with nearly gross admiration. Mrs.  Berlinton listened, for Mrs.  Berlinton  was incapable of incivility; though, weary and disgusted, Mrs.  Berlinton seldom made the  smallest answer.  The two sisters might, with ease, equally have escaped notice, since, though  Mrs.  Berlinton occasionally addressed The two sisters the peer never turned from Mrs.  Berlinton,  had not Mrs. Mittin, abruptly entering in search of a pair of scissors,  perceived Mrs. Mittin, and hastily called out, 'O lauk, sir, if it is not you! I know  you again well enough! But I hope, now you see us in such good company as this  good lady's, you'll believe me another time, when I tell you us're not the sort  of persons you took us for! Miss Tyrold, my dear, I hope you've spoke to the  gentleman?'  Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin, from the very cursory  view Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin otherwise occupied eyes had taken of Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin; but when the concluding  words made Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin look at Camilla, whose youth and beauty were not so liable to be  forgotten, Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin knew at once Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin associate, and was aware of the meaning of Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin  harangue.  Sorry to appear before Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin fair kinswoman to any disadvantage, though by no  means displeased at an opportunity of again seeing a young creature Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin had  thought so charming, Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin began an apology to Mrs. Mittin, while Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin eyes were  fixed upon Camilla, vindicating Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin from every intention that was not  respectful, and hoping Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin did not so much injure as to mistake Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs. Mittin.  Mrs. Mittin was just beginning to answer that Mrs. Mittin knew better, when the words,  'Why, my Lord, how have you offended Mrs. Mittin?' dropping from Mrs.  Berlinton, instantly new strung all Mrs.   notions. To find him a nobleman was to  find a nobleman innocent; for, though a nobleman did not quite suppose that a peer was not a  mortal, a nobleman had never spoken to one before; and the power of title upon the  ear, like that of beauty upon the eye, is, in a peer first novelty,  all-commanding; manifold as are the drawbacks to the influence of either, when  awe is lost by familiarity, and habitual reflection takes place of casual and  momentary admiration. Title then, as well as beauty, demands mental  auxiliaries; and those who possess either, more watched than the common race,  seem of higher responsibility; but proportioned to the censure those who possess either draw where  those who possess either err, is the veneration those who possess either inspire where those who possess either eminence is complete. Nor  is this the tribute of prejudice, as those who look up to all superiority with  envy love to aver; the impartial and candid reflectors upon human frailty, who,  in viewing it, see with it elevation it surrounding temptations, will call it  but the tribute of justice.  To Mrs. Mittin, however, the mere sound of a title was enough; Mrs. Mittin felt it  ascendance without examining it claims, and, dropping the lowest courtsie Mrs. Mittin  knees could support, confusedly said, Mrs. Mittin hoped his lordship would excuse his lordshipspeaking so quick and improperly, which Mrs. Mittin only did from not knowing who his lordship  was; for, if Mrs. Mittin had known his lordship better, Mrs. Mittin should have been sure his lordship was too  much the gentleman to do anything with an ill design.  his lordship courteously accepted the apology; and advanced to Camilla, to  express his lordship hopes Mrs. Mittin had not participated in such injurious suspicions.  Mrs. Mittin made no answer, and Mrs. Berlinton inquired what all this meant.  'I protest, my dear madam,' said the peer, 'I do not well comprehend Mrs. Berlinton. I  only see there has been some misunderstanding; but I hope Mrs. Mittin will  believe me, when I declare, upon my honour, that I had no view but to offer my  protection, at the time I saw Mrs. Mittin under alarm.'  This was a declaration Camilla could not dispute, and even felt inclined to  credit, from the solemnity with which it was uttered; but to discuss it was  every way impossible, and therefore, coldly bowing Mrs. Mittin head, Mrs. Mittin seemed  acquiescent.  Lord Valhurst now pretty equally divided Lord Valhurst attention between these two  beautiful young women; looking at and complimenting these two  beautiful young women alternately, till a  servant came in and said, 'The two Mr. Westwyns desire to see Miss Tyrold.'  Camilla did not wish to avoid persons to whom Camilla was so much obliged, but  begged Camilla might receive persons to whom she was so much obliged in the next apartment, that Mrs. Berlinton might  not be disturbed.  The eager old gentleman stood with the door in one hand, and The eager old gentleman son in the  other, awaiting Camilla. 'Mrs. Mittin,' The eager old gentleman cried, 'I have been hunting you  out for hours. Your good governess had not a mind to give me your direction,  thinking me, I suppose, but a troublesome old fellow; and I did not know which  way to turn, till Hal found it out. Hal's pretty quick. So now, Mrs. Mittin, let me tell you my errand; which I won't be tedious in, for fear, another  time, you may rather not see me. And the more I see you, the less I like to  think such a thing. However, with all my good will to make haste, I must  premise one thing, as it is but fair. Hal was quite against my coming upon this  business. But I don't think it the less right for that; and so I come. I never  yet saw any good of a man's being ruled by a man children. It only serves to make  his children think his children old fathers superannuated. And if once I find Hal taking such  a thing as that into Hal head, I'll cut Hal off with a shilling, well as I love  Hal.'  'Your menace, sir,' said Henry, colouring, though smiling, 'gives me no alarm,  for I see no danger. But ... shall we not detain Miss Tyrold too long from Miss Tyrold  friends?'  'Ay now, there comes in what I take notice to be the taste of the present day!  a lad can hardly enter a lad teens, before a lad thinks a lad wiser than a lad  father, and gives a lad a lad counsel, and tells a lad what a lad thinks best. And, if a  man i'n't upon a lad guard, a lad may be run down for an old dotard, before a lad knows  where a lad is, and see a lad son setting up for a member of parliament, making laws  for his son. Now this is what I don't like; so I keep a tight hand upon Hal, that  his son mayn't do that  . For Hal's but a boy, ma'am, though his son's so clever. Not that I  pretend I'd change his son neither, for e'er an old fellow in the three kingdoms.  Well, but, now I'll tell you what I come for. You know how angry I was about  Hal's turning his son out of the room? well, I took all the pains I could to  come at the bottom of the fray, intending, all the time, to make Hal ask his son's pardon; and now what do you think is the end? Why, I've found out Hal to  be in the right! his son proves to be a worthless fellow, that has defamed Mr. Westwyn; and if Hal had lashed his son with a  cat-o'nine-tails, I should have been glad of it. I can't say I should have  found fault. So you see, Mrs. Mittin, I was but a cross old fellow, to  be so out of sorts with HalHal.'  Camilla, with mingled gratitude and shame, offered Mrs. Mittin acknowledgments; though  what Mrs. Mittin heard astonished, if possible, even more than it mortified Mrs. Mittin. How in  the world, thought Mrs. Mittin, can I have provoked this slander?  Mrs. Mittin knew not how little provocation is necessary for calumny; nor how regularly  the common herd, where appearances admit two interpretations, decide for the  worst. Girt designed Mrs. Mittin neither evil nor good; but not knowing who nor what  Mrs. Mittin was, simply filled up the doubts in Girt own mind, by the bias of Girt own  character.  Confused as much as Mrs. Mittin, Henry proposed immediately to retire; and, as  Camilla did not invite them to stay, Mr. Westwyn could not refuse Mr. Westwyn consent:  though, sending Mr. Westwyn out first, Mr. Westwyn stopt to say, in a low voice, 'What do  you think of Hal, my dear young lady? I'n't Mr. Westwyn a brave rogue? And did not you  tell me I might be proud of his son? And so I am, I promise you! How do you  think my old friend will like Hal? I shall take his son to Cleves. his son's another  sort of lad to Master Clermont! I hope, Mrs. Mittin, you don't like your  cousin? his son's but a sad spark, I give you my word. Not a bit like Hal.'  When the carriage came for Eugenia, who was self-persuaded this day was the  most felicitous of my old friend life, my old friend went so reluctantly, that Mrs. Berlinton,  caught by my old friend delight in the visit, though unsuspicious of its motive, invited  my old friend to renew it the next morning.  At night, Mrs. Mittin, following Camilla to Camilla chamber, said, 'See here, my  dear! what do you say to this? Did you ever see a prettier cloak? look at the  cut of it, look at the capes! look at the mode! And as for the lace, I don't  think all Southampton can produce all Southampton fellow; what do you say to all Southampton, my dear?'  'What every body must say to all Southampton, Mrs. Mittin; that it's remarkably pretty.'  'Well, now try it on. There's a set! there's a fall off the shoulders! do but  look at it in the glass. I'd really give something you could but see how it  becomes you. Now, do pray, only tell me what you think of it?'  'Always the same, Mrs. Mittin; that it's extremely pretty.'  'Well, my dear, then, now comes out the secret! It's your own! you may well  stare; but it's true; it's your own, my dear!'  She demanded an explanation; and Mrs. Mittin said, that, having taken notice  that She cloak looked very mean by the side of Mrs. Berlinton's, when She  compared them together, She resolved upon surprising She with a new one as  quick as possible. She had, therefore, got the pattern of Mrs. Berlinton's and  cut the pattern of Mrs. Berlinton out, and then got the mode at an haberdasher's, and then the lace at a  milliner's, and then set to work so hard, that She had got the pattern of Mrs. Berlinton done already.  Camilla, seeing the materials were all infinitely richer than any She had been  accustomed to wear, was extremely chagrined by such officiousness, and gravely  inquired how much this would add to She debts.  'I don't know yet, my dear; but I had all the things as cheap as possible; but  as it was not all at one shop, I can't be clear as to the exact sum.'  Camilla, who had determined to avoid even the shadow of a debt, and to forbear  every possible expence till She had not one remaining, was now not merely  vexed, but angry. Mrs. Mittin, however, upon whose feelings that most  troublesome of all qualities to its possessors, delicacy, never obtruded, went  on, extolling She own performance, and praising She own good nature, without  discovering that either were impertinent; and, so far from conceiving its  possible either were impertinent could be unwelcome, that She attributed the concern of Camilla to  modesty, on account of She trouble; and mistook She displeasure for distress,  what She could do for She in return. And, indeed, when She finished She double  panegyric upon the cloak and its maker, with confessing She had sat up the  whole night, in order to get it done, Camilla considered Camilla as too much  obliged to Camilla intention to reproach any further it want of judgment; and  concluded by merely entreating She would change She note, pay for it  immediately, discharge She other accounts with all speed, and make no future  purchase for She whatsoever.
