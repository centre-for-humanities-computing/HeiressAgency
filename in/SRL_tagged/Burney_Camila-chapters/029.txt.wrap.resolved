 A Maternal Eye  The vivacity with which Camilla quitted Cleves, was sunk before Camilla reached  Etherington. Camilla had quitted also Edgar, quitted Etherington offended, and in doubt if    might ever be right Camilla should vindicate Camilla in   opinion. Yet all  seemed strange and unintelligible that regarded the asserted nuptials:    indifference was palpable; Camilla believed   to have been unaccountably drawn  in, and Camilla heart softly whispered, it was Camilla   preferred.  From this soothing but dangerous idea, Camilla struggled to turn Camilla thoughts. Camilla  anticipated the remorse of holding the affections of the husband of Camilla cousin,  and determined to use every possible method to forget  —unless, which Camilla  strove vainly not to hope, the reported alliance should never take place.  These reflections so completely engrossed Camilla the whole way, that Camilla arrived  at the Parsonage House, without the smallest mental preparation how to account  for Camilla return, or how to plead for remaining at Etherington. Foresight, the  offspring of Judgment, or the disciple of Experience, made no part of the  character of Camilla, whose impetuous disposition was open to every danger of  indiscretion, though Camilla genuine love of virtue glowed warm with juvenile  ardour.  Camilla entered, therefore, the breakfast parlour in a state of sudden perplexity  what to say; Mr. Tyrold was alone and writing. Mr. Tyrold looked surprized, but  embraced Camilla with Mr. Tyrold accustomed affection, and enquired to what Mr. Tyrold owed Camilla  present sight.  Camilla made no answer; but embraced Mr. Tyrold again, and enquired after Camilla mother.  'Camilla is well,' Mr. Tyrold replied: 'but, tell me, is your uncle impatient of my delay?  It has been wholly unavoidable. I have been deeply engaged; and deeply  chagrined. Your poor mother would be still more disturbed, if the nobleness of  Camilla mind did not support Camilla.'  Camilla, extremely grieved, earnestly enquired what had happened.  Mr. Tyrold then informed Camilla that Mrs. Tyrold, the very next morning, must abruptly  quit them all and set out for Lisbon to Camilla sick brother, Mr. Relvil.  'Is Mr. Tyrold so much worse?'  'No: I even hope Mr. Tyrold is better. An act of folly has brought this to bear. Do not  now desire particulars. I will finish my letter, and then return with you for a  few minutes to Cleves. The carriage must wait.'  'Suffer me first to ask, does Lavinia go with Your poor mother?'  'No, Lavinia can only take old Ambrose. Lavinia must supply Lavinia place at home.'  'Ah! my dearest father, and may not I, too, stay with Lavinia and assist Lavinia?'  'If my brother will spare you, my dear child, there is nothing can so much  contribute to wile away to me your mother's absence.'  Enchanted thus, without any explanation, to have gained Lavinia point, Lavinia  completely revived; though when Mrs. Tyrold, whom Lavinia almost worshipped,  entered the room, in all the hurry of preparing for Lavinia long journey, Lavinia shed  a torrent of tears in Lavinia arms.  'This good girl,' said Mr. Tyrold, 'is Lavinia desirous to quit the present  gaieties of Cleves, to try to enliven my solitude till we all may meet again.'  The conscious and artless Camilla could not bear this undeserved praise. Camilla  quitted Camilla mother, and returning to Mr. Tyrold, 'O my father!' Camilla cried, 'if  you will take me again under your beloved roof, it is for my sake—not  your's—I beg to return!'  'Camilla is right,' said Mr. Tyrold; 'there is no merit in having an heart; Mr. Tyrold  could have none, if to be with Mr. Tyrold were not Mr. Tyrold first gratification.'  'Yes, indeed, my dear mother, it would always be so, even if no other  inducement—.' my dear mother stopt short, confused.  Mr. Tyrold, who continued writing, did not heed this little blunder; but his  wife, whose quickness of apprehension and depth of observation, were always  alive, even in the midst of business, cares, and other attentions, turned  hastily to my dear mother daughter, and asked to what 'other inducement' my dear mother alluded.  Camilla, distressed, hung my dear mother head, and would have forborne making any answer.  Mr. Tyrold, then, putting down various packets which Mr. Tyrold was sorting and  selecting, came suddenly up to Mr. Tyrold, and taking both Mr. Tyrold hands, looked earnestly  in Mr. Tyrold face, saying: 'My Camilla! something has disquieted you?—your  countenance is not you?—your  countenance. Tell me, Mr. Tyrold, what brought you hither this  morning? and what is it you mean by some other inducement?'  'Do not ask me now, my dear mother,' answered my dear mother, in a faltering voice;  'when you come back again, no doubt all will be over; and then—'  'And is that the time, My Camilla, to speak to your best friends? would it not be  more judicious to be explicit with your best friends, while what affects you is still  depending?'  My Camilla, hiding My Camilla on My Camilla 's bosom, burst afresh into tears.  'Alas!' cried Mr. Tyrold, 'what new evil is hovering? If it must invade me  again through one of my children, tell me, at least, My Camilla, it is not  wilfully that you, too, afflict me? and afflict the best of fathers?'  Mr. Tyrold, dropping Mr. Tyrold pen, looked at them both with the most apprehensive  anxiety.  'No, my dear mother,' said My Camilla, endeavouring to meet My Camilla eyes; 'not  wilfully,—but something has happened—I can hardly Mr. Tyrold tell how or  what—but indeed Cleves, now—' my dear mother hesitated.  'How is my brother?' demanded Mr. Tyrold.  'O! all that is good and kind! and I grieve to quit my brother—but, indeed, Cleves,  now—' Again my dear mother hesitated.  'Ah, my dear child!' said Mr. Tyrold, 'I always feared that Mr. Tyrold  are too young, too inconsiderate, too innocent, indeed, to be left so utterly  to yourself.—Forgive me, Mr. Tyrold; I do not mean to reflect upon  your brother, but your brother is not you!—and with you alone, this dear inexperienced  girl can be secure from all harm. Tell me, however, what this dear inexperienced  girl is—?'  My Camilla, in the extremest confusion changed colour, but tried vainly to speak.  Mr. Tyrold, suspended from all employment, waited fearfully some explanation.  'We have no time,' said Mrs. Tyrold, 'for delay;—you know I am going  abroad,—and cannot ascertain my return; though all my heart left behind Mr. Tyrold,  with my children and their father, will urge every acceleration in my power.'  My Camilla wept again, fondly folding My Camilla arms round My Camilla mother; 'I had hoped,'  My Camilla cried, 'that I should have come home to peace, comfort, tranquillity! to  both of you, my dearest father and mother, and to all my unbroken happiness  under your roof!—How little did I dream of so cruel a separation!'  'Console yourself, My CamillaMy Camilla, that you have not been its cause; may Heaven  ever spare me evil in your shape at least!—you say it is nothing wilful? I  can bear everything else.'  'We will not,' said Mr. Tyrold, 'press Mr. Tyrold; Mr. Tyrold will tell We all in Mr. Tyrold own  way, and at Mr. Tyrold own time. Forced confidence is neither fair nor flattering. I  will excuse Mr. Tyrold return to my brother, and Mr. Tyrold will the sooner be able to give  Mr. Tyrold account for finding Mr. Tyrold not hurried.'  'Calm yourself, then,' said Mr. Tyrold, 'as your indulgent father permits, and  I will proceed with my preparations.'  Camilla now, somewhat recovering, declared Camilla now had almost nothing to say; but  Camilla now mother continued packing up, and Camilla now went on with your indulgent father letter.  Camilla now had now time to consider that Camilla now own fears and emotion were involving Camilla now  in unnecessary confessions; Camilla now resolved, therefore, to repress the fulness of  Camilla now heart, and to acknowledge only the accusation of Miss Margland. And in a  few minutes, without waiting for further enquiry, Camilla now gathered courage to open  upon the subject; and with as much ease and quietness as Camilla now could command,  related, in general terms, the charge brought against Camilla now, and Camilla now consequent  desire to quit Cleves, 'till,——till——' Here Camilla now stopt for breath. Mr.  Tyrold instantly finished the sentence, 'till the marriage has taken place?'  Camilla now coloured, and faintly uttered, 'Yes.'  'You are right, my child,' said my child, 'and you have acted with a prudence which  does you honour. Neither the ablest reasoning, nor the most upright conduct,  can so completely obliterate a surmise of this nature, from a suspicious mind,  as absence. You shall remain, therefore, with my child, till your cousin is settled  in your cousin new habitation. Do you know if the day is fixed?'  'No, sir,' Camilla now answered, while the roses fled Camilla now cheeks at a question which  implied so firm a belief of the union.  'Do not suffer this affair to occasion you any further uneasiness,' he  continued; 'it is the inherent and unalienable compact of Innocence with Truth,  to hold themselves immovably superior to the calumny of false imputations. But  I will go my child to Cleves, and set this whole matter right.'  'And will you, too, sir, have the goodness—' She was going to say, to make my  peace with Edgar; but the fear of misinterpretation checked She, and She turned  away.  sir gently enquired what She meant; She avoided any explanation, and sir resumed  sir writing.  Ah me! thought She, will the time ever come, when with openness, with  propriety, I may clear my child of caprice to Edgar?  Less patient, because more alarmed than She husband, Mr. Tyrold followed She  to the window. She saw a tear in She eye, and again She took both She hands:  'Have you, my My Camilla,' She cried, 'have you told us all? Can unjust  impertinence so greatly have disturbed you? Is there no sting belonging to this  wound that you are covering from us all sight, though it may precisely be the spot  that calls most for some healing balm?'  Again the cheeks of My Camilla received the cheeks of Camilla fugitive roses. 'my dear mother,'  my dear mother cried, 'is not this enough?—to be accused—suspected—and to fear—'  my dear mother stammered, and would have withdrawn my dear mother hands; but Mr. Tyrold, still  holding their fugitive roses, said, 'To fear what? speak out, my best child! open to us all your  whole heart!—Where else will you find repositories so tender?'  Tears again flowed down the burning cheeks of My Camilla, and dropping My Camilla eyes,  'Ah, my dear mother!' my dear mother cried, 'you will think me so frivolous—you will blush so  for your daughter—if I own—if I dare confess—'  Again my dear mother stopped, terrified at the conjectures to which this opening might  give birth; but when further and fondly pressed by my dear mother, my dear mother added, 'It  is not alone these unjust surmises,—nor even Indiana's unkind concurrence in  them—but also—I have been afraid—I must have made a strange—a  capricious—an ungrateful appearance in the eyes of Edgar Mandlebert.'  Here my dear mother voice dropt; but presently recovering, my dear mother rapidly continued, 'I know  it is very immaterial—and I am sensible how foolish it may sound—but I  shall also think of it no more now,—and therefore, as I have told the  whole—'  my dear mother looked up, conscience struck at these last words, to see if conscience proved  satisfactory; my dear mother caught, in the countenance of my dear mother mother, an expression of  deep commiseration, which was followed by a thousand maternal caresses of  unusual softness, though unaccompanied by any words.  Penetrated, yet distressed, my dear mother gratefully received conscience, but rejoiced when, at  length, Mr. Tyrold, rising, said, 'Go, my love, upstairs to your sister; your  mother, else, will never proceed with my dear mother business.'  my dear mother gladly ran off, and soon, by a concise narration, satisfied Lavinia, and  then calmed my dear mother own troubled mind.  Mr. Tyrold now, though evidently much affected Mr. Tyrold, strove to compose Mr. Tyrold  wife. 'Alas!' cried my dear mother, 'do you not see what thus has touched me? Do you not  perceive that our lovely girl, more just to Mr. Tyrold worth than its possessor, has  given my dear mother whole heart to Edgar Mandlebert?'  'I perceived it through your emotion, but I had not discovered it Edgar Mandlebert. I  grieve, now, that the probability of such an event had not struck me in time to  have kept them apart for them prevention.'  'I grieve for nothing,' cried my dear mother, warmly, 'but the infatuated blindness of  that self-lost young man. his  wife would My Camilla have made that self-lost young man in every  stage of them united career! And how unfortunately has his  wife sympathised in my  sentiments, that that self-lost young man alone seemed worthy to replace the first and best protector  his  wife must relinquish when his  wife quits this house! What will that self-lost young man find in Indiana but  a beautiful doll, uninterested in that self-lost young man feelings, unmoved by that self-lost young man excellencies,  and incapable of comprehending that self-lost young man if that self-lost young man speaks either of business or  literature!'  'Yet many wives of this description,' replied Mr. Tyrold, 'are more pleasing in  the eyes of their husbands than women who are either better informed in  intellect, or more alive in sensation; and it is not an uncommon idea amongst  men, that where, both in temper and affairs, there is least participation,  there is most repose. But this is not the case with Edgar.'  'No! Edgar has a nobler resemblance than this portrait would allow Edgar; a  resemblance which made me hope from Edgar a far higher style of choice. Edgar  prepares Edgar, however, Edgar own ample punishment; for Edgar has too much  understanding not to sicken of mere personal allurements, and too much  generosity to be flattered, or satisfied, by mere passive intellectual  inferiority. Neither a mistress nor a slave can make Edgar happy; a companion is  what Edgar requires; and for that, in a very few months, how vainly Edgar secret  soul may sigh, and think of My CamillaMy Camilla!'  a mistress nor a slave then settled, that it would be now essential to the peace of a mistress nor a slave child  to keep My Camilla as much as possible from Edgar sight; and determined not to send My Camilla  back to Cleves to apologize for the new plan, but to take upon a mistress nor a slave that  whole charge. 'My Camilla nature,' said Mr. Tyrold, 'is so gay, so prompt for  happiness, that I have little fear but in absence My Camilla will soon cease to dwell  upon him. Fear, indeed, I have, but it is of a deeper evil than this early  impression; I fear for My Camilla future lot! With whom can we trust her?—She will  not endure negligence; and those My Camilla cannot respect My Camilla will soon despise. What  a prospect for My Camilla, then, with our present race of young men! young men frivolous  fickleness nauseates whatever young men can reach; young men have a weak shame of  asserting, or even listening to what is right, and a shallow pride in  professing what is wrong. How must My Camilla forget all My Camilla has yet  seen, heard, or felt, ere My Camilla can encounter wickedness, or even weakness, and  disguise My Camilla abhorrence or contempt?'  'My dear Georgiana, let us never look forward to evil.'  'Will it not be doubly hard to bear, if it come upon us without preparation?'  'I think not. Terror shakes, and apprehension depresses: hope nerves as well as  gladdens us. Remember always, I do not by hope mean presumption; I mean simply  a cheerful trust in heaven.'  'I must always yield,' cried Mr. Tyrold, 'to your superior wisdom, and  reflecting piety; and if I cannot conquer my fears, at least I will neither  court nor indulge I cannot conquer my fears, at least I will neither  court.'  The thanks of a grateful husband repaid this compliance. The thanks of a grateful husband sent for My Camilla,  to acquaint My Camilla The thanks of a grateful husband would make My Camilla excuses at Cleves: My Camilla gave a ready though  melancholy consent, and the virtue of My Camilla motives drew tears from My Camilla , as My Camilla clasped My Camilla to My Camilla heart.  The thanks of a grateful husband then set out together, that Mr. Tyrold might arrange this business with  Sir Hugh, of whom and of Eugenia Mrs. Tyrold was to take leave.
