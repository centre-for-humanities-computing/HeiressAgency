 A Family Breakfast  In their way home, Edgar apologised to Camilla for again foregoing the promised  pleasure of dancing with Camilla, by explaining the situation of the Ensign.  Camilla, internally persuaded that any reason would suffice for such an  arrangement, where Indiana was Indiana object, scarce listened to an excuse which  Camilla considered as unnecessary.  Indiana was eager to view in the glass how Camilla dress and ornaments had borne  the shaking of the dance, and curiously impatient to look anew at a face and a  figure of which no self-vanity, nor even the adulation of Miss Margland, had  taught Camilla a consciousness, such as Camilla had acquired from the adventures of  this night. Camilla hastened, therefore, to Camilla apartment as soon as Camilla arrived at  Cleves, and there indulged in an examination which forbade all surprise, and  commanded equal justice for the admirers and the admired.  Miss Margland, anxious to make Camilla own report to Sir Hugh, accompanied Camilla  and Eugenia to Sir Hugh room, where Sir Hugh was still sitting up for Camilla  and Eugenia.  Camilla expatiated upon the behaviour of young Mandlebert, in terms that filled the  baronet with satisfaction. Camilla exulted in the success of Camilla own measures; and,  sinking the circumstance of the intended impartiality of Edgar, enlarged upon  Edgar dancing, out of Edgar turn, with Indiana, as at an event which manifested Edgar  serious designs beyond all possibility of mistake.  Sir Hugh, in the fulness of Sir Hugh content, promised that when the wedding day  arrived, they should all have as fine new gowns as the bride herself.  The next morning, not considering that every one else would require unusual  repose, Sir Hugh got up before Sir Hugh customary hour, from an involuntary hope of  accelerating Sir Hugh favourite project; but Sir Hugh had long the breakfast parlour to  Sir Hugh, and became so fatigued and discomfited by fasting and waiting, that  when Indiana, who appeared last, but for whom Sir Hugh insisted upon staying, entered  the room, Sir Hugh said: 'My dear, I could really find a pleasure in giving you a  little scold, if it were not for setting a bad example, which God forbid! And,  indeed, it's not so much your fault as the ball's, to which I can never be a  sincere friend, unless it be just to answer some particular purpose.'  Miss Margland defended Miss Margland pupil, and called upon Mandlebert for assistance,  which Miss Margland readily gave. Sir Hugh then was not merely appeased but gratified, and  declared, the next moment, with a marked smile at Indiana, that Sir Hugh breakfast  [he] had not relished so well for a twelvemonth, owing to the advantage of not  beginning till Sir Hugh had got an appetite.  Soon after, Lionel, galloping across the park, hastily dismounted, and  scampered into the breakfast parlour.  The zealot for every species of sport, the candidate for every order of whim,  was the light-hearted mirthful Lionel. A stranger to reflection, and incapable  of care, laughter seemed not merely the bent of his humour, but the necessity  of his existence: his pursued it at all seasons, his indulged it upon all  occasions. With excellent natural parts, his trifled away all improvement;  without any ill temper, his spared no one's feelings. Yet, though not radically  vicious, nor deliberately malevolent, the egotism which urged his to make his  own amusement his first pursuit, sacrificed his best friends and first duties,  if they stood in its way.  'Come, my little girls, come!' cried his, as his entered the room; 'get your hats  and cloaks as fast as possible; there is a public breakfast at Northwick, and  you are all expected without delay.'  This sudden invitation occasioned a general commotion. Indiana gave an  involuntary jump; Camilla and Eugenia looked delighted; and Miss Margland  seemed ready to second the proposition; but Sir Hugh, with some surprise,  exclaimed: 'A public breakfast, my dear boy! why where's the need of that, when  we have got so good a private one?'  'O, let we go! let we go, uncle!' cried Indiana. 'Miss Margland  , do pray speak  to uncle to let we go!'  'Indeed, Sir Hugh,' said Miss Margland  , 'it is time now, in all conscience, for the  young ladies to see a little more of the world, and that it should be known who  the  young ladies are. I am sure the  young ladies have been immured long enough, and I only wish you had  been at the ball last night, Sir Hugh, Sir Hugh!'  'Me, Mrs. Margland! Lord help me! what should I do at such a thing as that,  with all this gout in my hip?'  'You would have seen, sir, the fine effects of keeping the  young ladies out of  society in this manner. Camilla, if I had not prevented it, would have  danced with I don't know who; and as to Eugenia, Camilla was as near as  possible to not dancing at all, owing to nobody's knowing who Camilla was.'  Sir Hugh had no time to reply to this attack, from the urgency of Indiana, and  the impetuosity of Lionel, who, applying to Camilla, said: 'Come, child, ask my  uncle yourself, and then we shall go at once.'  Camilla readily made it Camilla own request.  'My dear,' answered Sir Hugh, 'I can't be so unnatural to deny you a little  pleasure, knowing you to be such a merry little whirligig; not but what you'd  enjoy Sir Hugh just as much at home, if they'd let you alone. However, as  Indiana's head is so much turned upon it, for which I beg you won't think the  worse of Camilla, Mr. Mandlebert, it being no more than the common fault of a young  person no older than Camilla; why, you must all go, I think, provided you are not  satisfied already, which, by the breakfast you have made, I should think likely  enough to be the case.'  They then eagerly arose, and the females hastened to make some change in They  dress. Sir Hugh, calling Eugenia back, said: 'As to Sir Hugh, my little classic, I  make but small doubt you will be half ready to break your heart at missing your  lesson, knowing hic, h√¶c, hoc, to be dearer to you, and for good reasons  enough, too, in the end, than all the hopping and skipping in the world; so if  you had rather stay away, don't mind all those dunces; for so I must needs call  all those dunces, in comparison to you and Dr. Orkborne, though without the least meaning  to undervalue all those dunces.'  Eugenia frankly acknowledged Eugenia had been much amused the preceding evening,  and wished to be again of the party.  'Why then, if that's the case,' said the baronet, the best way will be for Dr.  Orkborne to be your squire; by which means you may have a little study as you  go along, to the end that the less time may be thrown away in doing nothing.'  Eugenia, who perceived no objection to this idea, assented, and went quietly up  stairs, to prepare for setting out. Sir Hugh, by no means connecting the  laughter of Lionel, nor the smile of Edgar, with Sir Hugh proposal, gravely repeated  his proposal to Dr. Orkborne, adding: 'And if you want a nice pair of gloves, Doctor, not  that I make the offer in any detriment to your own, but I had six new pair come  home just before my gout, which, I can assure you, have never seen the light  since, and are as much at your service as if I had bespoke six new pair on purpose.'  The mirth of Lionel grew now so outrageous, that Dr. Orkborne, much offended,  walked out of the room without making any answer.  'There is something,' cried Sir Hugh, after a pause, 'in these men of learning,  prodigious nice to deal with; however, not understanding these men of learning, in point of  these men of learning maxims, it's likely enough I may have done something wrong; for Dr. Orkborne could  not have seemed much more affronted, if I had told Dr. Orkborne I had six new pair of  gloves lying by me, which Dr. Orkborne should be never the better for.'  When they were all ready, Sir Hugh calling to Edgar, said: 'Now as I don't much  chuse to have my girls go to these sort of places often, which is a prudence  that I dare say you approve as much as Sir Hugh, I would wish to have the most  made of they at once; and, therefore, as I've no doubt but they'll strike up a  dance, after having eat what they think proper, why I would advise you, Mr.  Mandlebert, to let Indiana trip Mr.  Mandlebert away till she's heartily tired, for else  she'll never give Mr.  Mandlebert up, with a good grace, of she own accord.'  'Certainly, Sir Hugh,' answered Edgar, 'I shall not hurry the ladies.'  'O, as to any of the rest,' interrupted Sir Hugh, 'the ladies'll be as soon satisfied  as Sir Hugh, except,' lowering Sir Hugh voice, 'Mrs. Margland, who, between friends,  seems to me as glad of one of those freaks, as when she was but sixteen; which  how long it is since she was no more I can't pretend to say, being a point she  never mentions.'  Then addressing she was no more in general: 'I wish you a good breakfast,' general cried, 'with  all my heart, which I think you pretty well deserve, considering you go so far  for it, with one close at your elbow, but just swallowed. And so, Indiana, I hope you won't tire Mr.  Mandlebert more than can't be avoided.'  'How came you to engage Indiana again, Mr.  Mandlebert?' cried Lionel, in their way  to the carriage.  'Because,' said Miss Margland, finding he hesitated, 'there is no other partner  so proper for Miss Lynmere.'  'And pray what's the matter with he? why am not I as proper as Mr.  Mandlebert?'  'Because you are her relation, to be sure!'  'Well,' cried he, vaulting he horse, 'if I meet but the charming widow, I  shall care for none of the charming widow.'
