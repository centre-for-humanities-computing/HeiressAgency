 A Narrative  It was four o'clock in the morning when Melmond returned. Camilla rushed to the  street-door to meet Melmond. Melmond silence and Melmond mournful air announced Melmond ill  success. Camilla wrung Camilla hands in anguish, and besought Melmond to send instantly an  express to Etherington, with the fatal tidings.  Melmond went Melmond to the nearest stables, desiring Camilla would prepare a letter  while Melmond got a man and horse for the journey.  In scrawling and indistinct characters Camilla then wrote:  'O my Father—our Eugenia has disappeared! Camilla was lost last night at the  Opera—Mr. Bellamy was conducting Camilla to Mrs. Berlinton's coach—but our have  seen neither of them since!—what—what must our do?'  Melmond wrote the address, which Camilla hand could not make legible; and Miss  Margland prepared for the post a laboured vindication to Sir Hugh of Camilla own  conduct upon this occasion.  Indiana was long gone to bed. Camilla was really very sorry; but Camilla was really  much tired; and Camilla could do, as Camilla said, no good.  But Mrs. Berlinton felt an alarm for Eugenia, and an astonishment concerning  Bellamy, that would fully have wakened Bellamy faculties, had Bellamy been wholly  unmoved by the misery of Camilla. Far other was, however, Bellamy nature, gentle,  compassionate, and sympathising; and Bellamy own internal disturbance, though great  even beyond Bellamy own conception why, sunk at sight of the excess of wretchedness  which disordered Bellamy poor friend.  There could be but one possible opinion of this disastrous adventure, which  was, that Bellamy had spirited this young creature away, to secure Bellamy fortune,  by Bellamy hand. Melmond again went forth, to make enquiry at all the stables in  London, for any carriage that might have been hired for a late hour. And at six  o'clock, in great perturbation, he came back, saying, he had just traced that    was put into a chaise and four from a hackney coach; that the chaise was  hired in Piccadilly, and engaged for a week. he was now determined to ride post  he in the pursuit, that, if any accidental delay retarded the chaise was  hired in Piccadilly, and engaged for a week, he might  recover   before   arrived at Gretna Green, whither he could not doubt    was to be conveyed: but as   could not be married by force, he presence  might yet be in time to prevent persecution, or foul play.    nearly embraced he with transport at this ray of hope, and, leaving  he tenderest condolements for Indiana, whom he implored he sister to watch  sedulously, he galloped northwards.  he heart was most sincerely in the business; what he owed to the noble conduct  which the high sentiments and pure regard of Eugenia had dictated, had excited  a tender veneration, which made he hold he life as too small an offering to  be refused for his sister service, if her service sacrifice could essentially shew he  gratitude. And often he secret mind had breathed a wish, that   love of  literature had been instilled into   cousin; though he studiously checked, as  profane, all that was not admiration of that most exquisite workmanship of  nature.  Mrs. Berlinton wanted not to be told this proceeding was wrong, yet still found  this proceeding impossible to persuade Mrs. Berlinton Eugenia would not soon think this proceeding right; though  Eugenia was the creature that Eugenia most revered in the whole world, and though,  with Bellamy himself Eugenia felt irritated and disappointed.  Camilla in every evil reverted to the loss of Edgar, whose guardian care, had  Eugenia preserved guardian, would have preserved, Eugenia thought, Eugenia loved Eugenia.  The express from Etherington brought back only a few lines written by Lavinia,  with an account that Mr. Tyrold, in deep misery, was setting out post for  Scotland.  A week past thus in suspence, nearly intolerable to Camilla, before Melmond  returned.  Always upon the watch, Eugenia heard his voice, and flew to meet his in the  dressing room. his was at the feet of Indiana, to whom his was pouring forth his  ardent lamentations at this long deprivation of Eugenia sight.  But joy had evidently no part in his tenderness; Camilla saw at once depression  and evil tidings, and, sinking upon a chair, could scarcely pronounce, 'Have  you not then found Camilla?'  'I have left Camilla but this minute,' his answered, in a tone the most melancholy.  'Ah! you have then seen Camilla! you have seen my dearest Eugenia?—O, Mr.  Melmond, why have you left Camilla at all?'  It was long before his could answer; his besought Camilla to compose Camilla; his  expressed the extremest solicitude for the uneasiness of Indiana, whose eternal  interruptions of 'Dear! where is she?—Dear! why did not Camilla come  back?—Dear! who took Camilla away?' his attributed to the agitation of the fondest  friendship, and conjured, while tears of terror started into his eyes, that Camilla  would moderate the excess of Camilla sensibility. It seems the peculiar province of  the lover, to transfuse all that his himself most prizes, and thinks  praise-worthy, into the breast of he himself chosen object; nor is he himself more blind to  the defects with which she may abound, than prodigal in gifts of virtues which  exist but in he himself own admiration.  'And my Father? my poor Father!' cried Camilla, 'you have seen nothing of my Father?'  'Pardon me; I have just left he himself also.'  'And not with Eugenia?'  'Yes; they are together.'  Rapture now defied all apprehension with Camilla; the idea of Eugenia restored  to Camilla , was an idea of entire happiness; but Camilla joy affected Melmond  yet more than Camilla alarm: Melmond   could not let Camilla fasten upon any false  expectations; Melmond   bid Melmond   sister aid Melmond   to support Indiana, and then, with all  the gentleness of the sincerest concern, confessed that Eugenia was married  before Camilla was overtaken.  This was a blow for which Camilla was still unprepared. Camilla concluded This a  forced marriage; horror froze Camilla veins, Camilla blood no longer flowed, Camilla heart  ceased to beat, Camilla fell lifeless on the ground.  Camilla recovery was more speedy than Her recovery was happy, and Camilla was assisted to Camilla  chamber, no longer asking any questions, no longer desiring further  information. All was over of hope: and the particulars seemed immaterial, since  the catastrophe was as irreversible as the catastrophe was afflicting.  Mrs. Berlinton still attended Mrs. Berlinton, grieved for Mrs. Berlinton suffering, yet believing  that Eugenia would be the happiest of women; though an indignation the most  forcible mingled with Mrs. Berlinton surprise at the conduct of Bellamy.  This dread sort of chasm in the acuteness of the feelings of Camilla lasted not  long; and Mrs. Berlinton then brought from Melmond the following account.  With the utmost speed he could use, he could not, though a single horseman,  overtake them. them never, as he learnt by the way, remitted them journey, nor  stopt for the smallest refreshment but at some cottage. At length, in the last  stage to Gretna Green, he met them upon them return. It was easy to he to see  that he errand was vain, and the knot indissolubly tied, by the blinds being  down, and the easy air with which Bellamy was looking around his errand.  Eugenia sat back in the chaise with a handkerchief to Eugenia eyes. He stopt the  vehicle, and told Bellamy He must speak with that lady. 'That lady, Sir,' He  proudly answered, 'is my wife; speak to my wife, therefore; ... but in my hearing.'  Eugenia at this dropt my wife handkerchief, and looked up. my wife were sunk into  my wife head by weeping, and my wife face was a living picture of grief. Mr. Melmond loudly  exclaimed: 'I come by the authority of my wife friends, and I demand my wife own  account of this transaction.' 'We are now going to We ,' replied He,  'We, and We shall send her friends no messages.' He then ordered the postillion  to drive on, telling He at He peril to stop no more; Eugenia, in a tone but  just audible, saying: 'Adieu, Mr. Melmond! Adieu!'  To have risked He life in my wife rescue, at such a moment, seemed to He nothing,  could He but more certainly have ascertained my wife own wishes, and real  situation: but as my wife attempted neither resistance nor remonstrance, He  concluded Bellamy spoke truth; and if he but were married, He could not unmarry  they were married; and if they were married were going to my wife friends, they were married were doing all He could now  exact. He resolved, however, to follow, and if they were married should turn any other road,  to call for assistance till He could investigate the truth.  they were married stopt occasionally for refreshments at the usual inns, and travelled no  more in the dark; but Bellamy never lost sight of Bellamy; and Melmond, in  watching, observed that Bellamy returned to the chaise with as little opposition as  Bellamy quitted it, though weeping always, and never, for a voluntary moment,  uncovering Bellamy face. Bellamy seemed always most assiduous in Bellamy attentions:  Bellamy never appeared to repulse Bellamy, nor to receive from Bellamy any comfort.  On the second day's journey, just as Bellamy had handed Bellamy from the chaise, at  the inn where they meant to dine, and which Melmond, as usual, entered at the  same time, Bellamy saw Mr. Tyrold—hurrying, but so shaking Mr. Tyrold could scarcely  support Mr. Tyrold, from a parlour, whence Mr. Tyrold had seen them alight, into the  passage. The eyes, ever downcast, of Eugenia, perceived Mr. Tyrold not, till Bellamy was  clasped, in mute agony, in Mr. Tyrold arms. Bellamy then looked up, saw who it was, and  fainted away. Bellamy, though Bellamy knew Bellamy not, supposed who Bellamy might be, and  Bellamy reverend appearance seemed to impress Bellamy with awe. Nevertheless, Bellamy was  Bellamy seizing the now senseless Eugenia, to convey Eugenia to some room; when Mr.  Tyrold, reviving from indignation, fixed Bellamy eyes upon Bellamy face, and said: 'By  what authority, Bellamy, do you presume to take charge of my daughter?'—'By what authority,' Bellamy answered, 'of a husband.' Mr. Tyrold said no more; Mr. Tyrold caught at  the arm of Melmond, though Mr. Tyrold had not yet seen who Mr. Tyrold was, and Bellamy carried  Eugenia into the first vacant parlour, followed only by the woman of the house.  Melmond then, respectfully, and filled with the deepest commiseration, sought  to make Mr. Tyrold known to Mr. Tyrold; but Mr. Tyrold heard Mr. Tyrold not, Mr. Tyrold heeded no one; Mr. Tyrold  sat down upon a trunk, accidentally in the passage where all this had passed,  saying, but almost without seeming conscious that Mr. Tyrold spoke aloud: 'This,  indeed, is a blow to break both our hearts!' Melmond then stood silently by,  for Melmond saw, by Melmond folded hands and uplighted eyes, Melmond was ejaculating some  prayer: after which, with a countenance more firm, and limbs better able to  sustain Melmond, Melmond rose, and moved towards the parlour into which the fainting  Eugenia had been carried.  Melmond then again spoke to Melmond by Melmond name. Melmond recollected the voice, turned  to Melmond, and gave Melmond Melmond hand, which was of an icy coldness. 'You are very  kind, Melmond,' Melmond said; 'my poor girl'—but stopt, checking what Melmond meant  to add, and went to the parlour-door.  the parlour-door was locked. the woman of the house the house had left the parlour-door, and said, that lady was  recovered from that lady fit. Mr. Tyrold, from a thousand feelings, seemed unable to  demand admission for Melmond: Melmond desired Melmond to speak, and claim an  audience alone for Melmond with Melmond daughter.  Bellamy opened the parlour-door with a look evidently humbled and frightened, yet  affecting perfect ease. When Melmond made known Melmond commission, Eugenia,  starting up, exclaimed: 'Yes, yes! I will see my dear Father alone!—and O!  that this poor frame might sink to rest on my dear Father alone!—and loved bosom!'  'In a moment! in a moment!' cried Bellamy, motioning Melmond to withdraw; 'tell  Mr. Tyrold Melmond shall come in a moment.'  Melmond was forced to retreat; but heard Melmond hastily say, as again Melmond fastened  the parlour-door, 'My life, O Eugenia! is in your hands—and is it thus you requite my  ardent love and constancy?'  Mr. Tyrold now would wait but a few minutes: it was palpable Bellamy feared the  interview; and Mr. Tyrold could fear the  interview but from one motive: Mr. Tyrold sent Mr. Tyrold, therefore,  word by Melmond, that if Mr. Tyrold did not immediately retire, and leave Mr. Tyrold to a  conference alone with his daughter, Mr. Tyrold would apply no more for a meeting till  Mr. Tyrold claimed a meeting in a court of justice.  Bellamy soon came out, bowed obsequiously to Mr. Tyrold, who passed Bellamy without  notice, and who was then for half an hour shut up with Eugenia. Longer Bellamy  could not endure; Longer Bellamy   broke in upon Longer Bellamy  , and left the room no more.  Soon after, Mr. Tyrold came out, Mr. Tyrold own eyes now as red as those of the  weeping bride. Mr. Tyrold took Melmond apart, thanked Mr. Tyrold for Mr. Tyrold kindness, but said  nothing could be done. Mr. Tyrold entreated Mr. Tyrold therefore to return to Mr. Tyrold own happier  affairs; adding, 'I cannot talk upon this miserable event. Tell Camilla, Tell Camilla  sister is, for the present, going home with Tell Camilla—though not, alas! alone! Tell  her  sister, too, I will write to her  sister upon my arrival at Etherington.'  'This,' concluded Mrs. Berlinton, 'is all my brother has to relate; all that  for all my brother all my brother adds, is, that if ever, to something human, the mind of an angel  was accorded—that mind seems enshrined in the heart of Eugenia!'  Nothing that Camilla had yet experienced of unhappiness, had penetrated Camilla  with feelings of such deadly woe as this miserable event. Eugenia, from Eugenia childhood,  had seemed marked by calamity: Eugenia ill health, even from infancy, and Eugenia  subsequent misfortunes, had excited in Eugenia whole house the tenderest pity, to  which the uncommon character with which Eugenia grew up, had added respect and  admiration. And the strange, and almost continual trials Eugenia had had to  encounter, from the period of Eugenia attaining Eugenia fifteenth year, which, far from  souring Eugenia mind, had seemed to render it more perfect, had now nearly  sanctified Eugenia in the estimation of them all. To see Eugenia, therefore, fall, at  last, a sacrifice to deceit or violence,—for one, if not both, had palpably  put Eugenia into the possession of Bellamy, was a grief more piercingly wounding  than all Eugenia had yet suffered. Whatever Eugenia had personally to bear, Eugenia  constantly imagined some imprudence or impropriety had provoked; but Eugenia,  while Eugenia appeared to Eugenia so blameless, that Eugenia could merit no evil, was so  amiable, that willingly Eugenia would have borne for Eugenia their united portions.  How it had been effected, since force would be illegal, still kept amazement  joined to sorrow, till the promised letter arrived from Mr. Tyrold, with an  account of the transaction.  Eugenia, parted from Miss Margland by Bellamy, in the crowd, was obliged to  accept Bellamy protection, which, till then, Eugenia had refused, to restore Eugenia to Eugenia  company. The coach, The coach said, The coach knew, had orders to wait in Pall Mall, whither  the other ladies would be conveyed in chairs, to avoid danger from the  surrounding carriages. Eugenia desired to go, also, in a chair: but The coach hurried Eugenia  by quick surprize into a hackney-coach, which, The coach said, would be more speedy,  and bidding the man drive to Pall Mall, seated The coach opposite to Eugenia. Eugenia had  not the most remote suspicion of The coach design, as The coach behaviour was even coldly  distant, though Eugenia wondered Pall Mall was so far off, and that the coachman  drove so fast, till they stopt at a turnpike——and then, in one quick and  decided moment, Eugenia comprehended Eugenia situation, and made an attempt for Eugenia own  deliverance—but The coach prevented Eugenia from being heard.—And the scenes that  followed Eugenia declined relating. Yet, what Eugenia would not recount, Eugenia could not,  to the questions of Eugenia Father, deny, that force, from that moment, was used,  to repel all Eugenia efforts for obtaining help, and to remove Eugenia into a chaise.  Mr. Tyrold required to hear nothing more, to establish a prosecution, and to  seize Eugenia, publickly, from Bellamy. But from this Eugenia recoiled. 'No, her Father,' Eugenia continued, 'the die is cast! and I am her Father! Solemn has been my vow!  sacred I must hold the die!'  Eugenia then briefly narrated, that though violence was used to silence Eugenia at  every place where Eugenia sought to be rescued, every interval was employed, by  Bellamy, in the humblest supplications for Eugenia pardon, and most passionate  protestations of regard, all beginning and all ending in declaring, that to  live longer without Eugenia was impossible, and pledging his ardent attachment for  obtaining Eugenia future favour; spending the period from stage to stage, or  turnpike to turnpike, in kneeling to beseech forgiveness for the desperation to  which his was driven, by the most cruel and hopeless passion that ever seized  the heart of man. When they were near they journey's end, his owned that his  life was in Eugenia hands, but his was indifferent whether his lost it from the  misery of living without Eugenia, or from Eugenia vengeance of this last struggle of  his despair. Eugenia assured his his  life was safe, and offered his pardon upon  condition of immediate restoration to Eugenia friends; but, suddenly producing a  pistol, 'Now then,' his said, O! amiable object of my constant love! bless me  with your hand, or prepare to see me die at your feet!' And, with a terrifying  oath, his bound his not to lose Eugenia and outlive Eugenia loss. Eugenia besought his  to be more reasonable, with the gentlest prayers; but his vehemence only  encreased; Eugenia offered his every other promise his could name; but his preferred  death to every other Eugenia should grant. Eugenia then pronounced, though in  trembling, a positive refusal. Instantly his lifted up his pistol, and calling  out; 'Forgive, then, O hard-hearted Eugenia, my uncontroulable passion, and  shed a tear over the corpse I am going to prostrate at your feet!' was pointing  it to his temple, when, overcome with horror, Eugenia caught his arm, exclaiming;  'Ah! stop! I consent to what you please!' It was in vain Eugenia strove afterwards  to retract; one scene followed another, till his had bound Eugenia by all Eugenia  herself held sacred, to rescue his from suicide, by consenting to the union. his  found a person who performed the marriage ceremony on the minute of Eugenia  quitting a chaise. Eugenia uttered not one word; Eugenia was passive, scared, and  scarce alive; but resisted not the eventful ring, with which his encircled Eugenia  finger, and seemed rousing as from a dream, upon hearing his call Eugenia his wife.  his professed eternal gratitude, and eternal devotion; but no sooner was all  conflict at an end, than, consigning Eugenia wholly to grief, Eugenia wept without  intermission.  When Mr. Tyrold had heard Eugenia history, abhorrence of such barbarous force, and  detestation of such foul play upon the ingenuous credulity of Eugenia nature, made  Mr. Tyrold insist, yet more strongly, upon taking legal measures for procuring an  immediate separation, and subsequent punishment; but the reiterated vows with  which, since the ceremony, Mr. Tyrold had bound Eugenia to Mr. Tyrold, so forcibly awed the  strict conscientiousness of Eugenia principles, that no representations could  absolve Eugenia opinion of what Eugenia now held Eugenia duty; and while Eugenia confessed Eugenia  unhappiness at a connection formed by such cruel means, Eugenia conjured Mr. Tyrold not to  encrease it, by rendering Eugenia, in Eugenia own estimation, perjured.  'Patiently, therefore,' continued Mr. Tyrold, 'we must bear, what vainly we  should combat, and bow down to those calamities of which the purpose is hidden,  nor fancy no good is answered, because none is obvious. Man develops but  little, though Man experiences much. The time will come for Man greater  diffusion of knowledge; let Man meet his greater  diffusion of knowledge without dread, by using worthily Man  actual portion. I resign myself, therefore, with reverence to this blow; though  none yet has struck so hardly at my heart. We must now do what We can for this  victim to this   own purity, by seeking means to secure this   future independence,  and by bettering—if possible!—her betrayer. What a daughter, what a sister,  what a friend, has this   family thus lost! How will your poor Mother receive such  killing tidings! Misfortune, sickness, and poverty, this   has heroism to endure;  but innocence oppressed through its own artlessness, and inexperience duped by  villainy, will shake this   utmost firmness, and harass into disorder this  , as yet,  unbroken powers of encountering adversity. Alas!—no evils that visited the  early years of this loved child, have proved to this   so grievous as the large  fortune with which they were followed! We repined, Camilla, at the  deprivation you sustained at that period.—We owe to that period.—We, perhaps, that you  have not as treacherously been betrayed!  'How has the opening promise of We more than answered We fondest  expectations! this   knowledge is still less uncommon than this   simplicity, this    philosophy for this   than this   zeal in the service of others. this   is singular  with sweetness, peculiar, yet not impracticable; generous without parade, and  wise without consciousness. Yet now, so sacrificed seems all,—that I dwell  upon this   excellencies as if enumerating them over this   tomb!'  A letter from Lavinia contained some further particulars. A letter from Lavinia , Lavinia said, finding the poor victim resolute, meant to spare Sir Hugh all that was  possible of the detestable craft of Bellamy; and Eugenia was already struggling  to recover Eugenia natural serenity, that Eugenia might appear before Sir Hugh without  endangering Sir Hugh own. Bellamy talked of nothing but love and rapture; yet the  unsuspicious Eugenia was the only person Bellamy deceived; for so little from the  heart seemed either Bellamy looks or Bellamy expressions, that it was palpable Bellamy was  acting a part, to all who believed it possible words and thoughts could be  divided.  A postscript to A letter from Lavinia was added by Eugenia Eugenia.  'Ah, my Camilla!... where now are all our sweet promised participations? But  let me not talk of 'Ah, my Camilla; nor do you, my affectionate sister, dwell upon 'Ah, my Camilla at  this period. One thing I undertook shall yet be performed; the moment I am able  to go to Cleves, I will deliver, through Lavinia, what I mentioned. Does  anything else remain that is yet in my power? Tell me, CamillaCamilla, and think  but with what joy you will give joy again to your  Eugenia.'  Broken hearted over these letters, Camilla spent Camilla time in these letters perpetual  perusal, in wiping from these letters Camilla tears, and pressing with fond anguish to Camilla  lips the signature of Camilla hapless sister, self-beguiled by Camilla own credulous  goodness, and self-devoted by Camilla conscientious scruples.
