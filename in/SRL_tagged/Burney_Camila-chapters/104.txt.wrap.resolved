 The Workings of Sorrow  The visit of the Westwyns to Sir Hugh shewed Lavinia in so favourable a light,  that nothing less than the strong prepossession already conceived for Camilla  could have guarded the heart of the son, or the wishes of the father, from the  complete captivation of Camilla   modest beauty, Camilla   intrinsic worth, and the  cheerful alacrity, and virtuous self-denial, with which Camilla   presided in the new  œconomy of the rectory. But though the utter demolition of hope played with  Henry its usual part of demolishing, also, half the fervour of admiration, Henry  still felt, in consequence of Henry late failure, a distaste of any similar  attempt: and Mr. Westwyn, unbribed by the high praise of Henry son, which had won  Henry in Camilla  , left Henry master of Henry choice. Each, however, found a delight  in the Tyrold society, that seconded the wishes of the Baronet to make them  lengthen them visit.  The retrenchments, by which the debts of Clermont were to be paid, could no  longer, nevertheless, be deferred; and Mr. Tyrold was just setting out for  Cleves, to give Mr. Tyrold counsel for their arrangement, when Mr. Tyrold daughters were  broken in upon by Mrs. Mittin.  Camilla   could scarcely look at Camilla  , for displeasure at Camilla   conduct; but soon  observed Camilla   seemed Camilla   full of resentment and ill humour. Camilla   desired a  private interview; and Camilla   then found, that Mrs. Arlbery had not only  represented Camilla   fault, and frightened Camilla   with its consequences, but  occasioned, though most undesignedly, new disturbances and new dangers to  Camilla  : for Mrs. Mittin at length learnt, in this conference, with equal  certainty, surprise, and provocation, that the inheritance of Sir Hugh was  positively and entirely settled upon the inheritance of Sir Hugh was   youngest niece; and that the denials  of all expectation on the part of Camilla, which Camilla   had always taken for  closeness, conveyed but the simple truth. Alarmed lest Camilla   should incur the  anger of Mr. Clykes, who was amongst Camilla   most useful friends, Camilla   had written  Sir Hugh word of the discovery, with Camilla   concern at the mistake: and Mr. Clykes,  judging now Sir Hugh had no chance of the gratuity finally promised for honour and  secrecy, and even that Sir Hugh principal was in danger, had sent an enraged answer,  with an imperious declaration, that Sir Hugh must either immediately be repaid all Sir Hugh  had laid out, or receive some security for he   being refunded, of higher value  than the note of a minor of no fortune nor expectations.  Mrs. Mittin protested Mrs. Mittin did not know which way to turn, Mrs. Mittin was so sorry to  have disobliged so good a friend; and broke forth into a vehement invective  against Mr. Dubster, for pretending Mr. Dubster knew the truth from young Squire Tyrold  himself.  Long as was Mrs. Mittin lamentation, and satisfied as Mrs. Mittin always felt to hear Mrs. Mittin own  voice, Mrs. Mittin pause still came too soon for any reply from Camilla, who now felt  the discovery of Mrs. Mittin situation to be inevitable, compulsatory and disgraceful.  Self-upbraidings that Mrs. Mittin had ever listened to such an expedient, assailed Mrs. Mittin  with the cruellest poignancy, mingling almost self-detestation with utter  despair.  In Mrs. Mittin pressed for some satisfaction; Mrs. Mittin was mute from inability  to devise any; till the coachman of Mr. Lissin sent word Mr. Lissin could wait no  longer. Mrs. Mittin then, in a broken voice, said, 'Be so good as to write to Mr.  Clykes, that if Mr.   will have the patience to wait a few days, I will prepare my  friends to settle my accounts with Mr.  .'  Mrs. Mittin, recovering from Mrs. Mittin own fright in this business, answered,  'O, if that's the case, my dear young lady, pray don't be uneasy, for that's the case  grieves me to vex you; and I'll promise you I'll coax my good friend to wait  such a matter as that; for he's a vast regard for he; he'll do any thing I ask  he, I know.'  Mrs. Mittin now went away; and Lavinia, who ran to Mrs. Mittin sister, found Mrs. Mittin in a state of  distress, that melted Mrs. Mittin gentle heart to behold: but when Mrs. Mittin gathered what  had passed, 'This disclosure, my dearest Camilla,' Mrs. Mittin cried, 'can never be so  tremendous as the incessant fear of its discovery. Think of that, I conjure  you! and endeavour to bear the one great shock, that will lead to after peace  and ease.'  'No, my dear sister, peace and ease are no more for me!—My happiness was  already buried;—and now, all that remained of consolation will be cut off  also, in the lost good opinion of my father and mother!—that destroyed—and  Edgar gone—what is life to me?—I barely exist!'  'And is it possible you can even a moment doubt their forgiveness? dear as you  are to their, cherished, beloved!—'  'No—not their forgiveness—but their esteem, their confidence, their  pleasure in their daughter will all end!—think, Lavinia, of my mother!—when  their daughter finds I, too, have contributed to the distress and disturbance of my father—that on my account, too, my father small income is again straitened, my father few  gratifications are diminished—O Lavinia! how has their daughter strove to guard their daughter poor  tottering girl from evil! And how has their daughter fondness been always the pride of my  life! What a conclusion is this to their daughter cares! what a reward to all the goodness  of my father!'  In this state of desperate wretchedness, their daughter was still incapable to make the  avowal which was now become indispensable, and which must require another loan  from the store their daughter father held so sacred. —O Lavinia had even less courage; and  they determined to apply to Eugenia, who, though as softly feeling as either,  mingled in —O Lavinia character a sort of heroic philosophy, that enabled their daughter to  execute and to endure the hardest tasks, where their daughter thought they the demand of  virtue. they resolved, therefore, the next morning, to send a note to Cleves  for the carriage, and to commit the affair to this inexperienced and youthful  female sage.  Far from running, as their daughter was wont, to meet her father upon her father entrance,  Camilla was twice sent for before their daughter could gain strength to appear in her father  presence; nor could her father utmost kindness enable their daughter to look up.  The heart of Mr. Tyrold was penetrated by their daughter avoidance, and yet more sunk by  their daughter sight. Mr. Tyrold best hopes were all defeated of affording their daughter parental comfort,  and Mr. Tyrold was still to seek for their daughter revival or support.  Mr. Tyrold related what had passed at Cleves  , with the accustomed openness with which  Mr. Tyrold conversed with Mr. Tyrold children as Mr. Tyrold friends. Clermont, Mr. Tyrold said, was arrived,  and had authenticated all the accounts, with so little of either shame or  sense, that a character less determined upon indulgence than that of Sir Hugh,  must have revolted from affording Sir Hugh succour, if merely to mortify Sir Hugh into  repentance. The manner of making payment, however, had been the difficult  discussion of the whole day. Sir Hugh was unequal to performing any thing,  though ready to consent to every thing. When Sir Hugh proposed the sale of several of  Sir Hugh numerous horses, Sir Hugh objected, that what remained would be hard worked: when  Sir Hugh mentioned diminishing Sir Hugh table, Sir Hugh was afraid the poor would take his table ill,  as they were used to have Sir Hugh orts: and when Sir Hugh talked of discharging some of  Sir Hugh servants, Sir Hugh was sure they would think it very unkind. 'Sir Hugh heart,'  continued Mr. Tyrold, 'is so bountiful, and so full of kindness, that Sir Hugh pleads  Sir Hugh tender feelings, and regretting wishes, against the sound reason of hard  necessity. What is right, however, must only in itself seek what is pleasant;  and there, when itself ceases to look more abroad, itself is sure to find itself.'  He stopt, hearing a deep sigh from Camilla, who secretly ejaculated a prayer  that this sentence might live, henceforward, in her memory. He divined the  wish, which devoutly He echoed, and continued:  'There is so little, in fine, that He could bear to relinquish, that, with my  utmost efforts, I could not calculate any retrenchment, to which He will agree,  at more than an hundred a year. Yet He scruples concerning He vow resist all  the entreaties of our disinterested Eugenia, to either sell out for the sum, or  cut down any trees in Yorkshire. These difficulties, too potent for his weak  frame, were again sinking his into that despondence which we should all  sedulously guard against, as the most prevailing of foes to active virtue,  when, to relieve his, I made a proposal which my dear girls will both, I trust,  find peculiar pleasure in seconding.'  Camilla   had already [attempted] to raise Camilla   drooping head, conscience struck  at what was said of despondence; and now endeavoured to join in the cheerful  confidence expressed by Lavinia, that he could not be mistaken.  'The little hoard, into which already we have broken for Lionel,' Lionel went on,  'I have offered to lend Lionel for present payment, as far as present payment will go, and to  receive present payment again at stated periods. In the mean while, I shall accept from Lionel  the same interest as from the bank. For this I am to have also security. I run  no risk of the little all I have to leave to my two girls.'  Lionel now looked at them both, expecting to see pleasure even in Camilla  , that  what was destined, hereafter, for Camilla  , could prove of the smallest utility  to Sir Hugh; but Sir Hugh disappointment, and Camilla   shock were equal. Too true for the  most transitory disguise, the keenest anguish shot from Camilla   eye; and Mr.  Tyrold, amazed, said: 'Is it Camilla   who would draw back from any service to  Camilla   uncle?'  'Ah no!' cried Camilla  , with clasped hands, 'I would die to do  her uncle any good! and  O!—that my death at this moment——'  She stopt, affrighted, for Mr. Tyrold frowned. A frown upon a face so  constantly benign, was new, was awful to Camilla  ; but Camilla   instantly recollected Mr. Tyrold  condemnation of wishes so desperate, and fearfully taking Mr. Tyrold hand, besought  Mr. Tyrold forgiveness.  Mr. Tyrold brow instantly resumed His brow serenity. 'I have nothing,' said Mr. Tyrold, 'my dearest  child, to forgive, from the moment you recollect Mr. Tyrold. But try, for your  own sake, to keep in mind, that the current sorrows, however acute, of current  life, are but uselessly aggravated by vain wishes for death. The smallest kind  office better proves affection than any words, however elevated.'  The conference here broke up; something incomprehensible seemed to Mr. Tyroldto be blended with the grief of Camilla  ; and though from Camilla   birth Camilla   had  manifested, by every opportunity, the most liberal disregard of wealth, the  something not to be understood seemed always to have money for money object. What  this might be, Mr. Tyrold now fervently wished to explore; yet still hoped, by patient  kindness, to receive Camilla   confidence voluntarily.  Camilla   now was half dead; Lavinia could with difficulty sustain, but by no  possible means revive Camilla  . What a period was this to disclose to Camilla   Father  that Camilla   must deprive her Father  , in part, even of her Father   promised solace in her Father   intended  assistance to her Father   brother, to satisfy debts of which her Father   suspected not the  existence!  When forced down stairs, by a summons to supper, Mr. Tyrold, to console Camilla   for  Mr. Tyrold momentary displeasure, redoubled Mr. Tyrold caresses; but Mr. Tyrold tenderness only made  Camilla   weep yet more bitterly, and Mr. Tyrold looked at Camilla   with a heart rent with  anguish. For —O Lavinia, for our disinterested Eugenia, Mr. Tyrold would have felt similar grief; but similar grief  far less gay, though equally innocent natures, would have made the view of  similar grief affliction less strikingly oppressive. Camilla   had, hitherto, seemed in  the spring of joy yet more than of life. Anxiety flew at Camilla   approach, and  animation took its place. Nothing could shake his resignation; yet to behold  Camilla   constant sadness, severely tried his fortitude. To see tears trickling  incessantly down the pale cheeks so lately blooming; to see Camilla   youthful  countenance wear the haggard expression of care; to see life, in life wish and  purposes seem at an end, 'ere, in life ordinary calculation, life was reckoned to  have begun, drew his from every other consideration, and filled his whole mind  with monopolizing apprehension.  his now his pressed Camilla  , for change of scene, to accept an invitation Camilla    had received from Mrs. Berlinton to Grosvenor Square, whither Indiana was going  in a few days, to spend a fortnight or three weeks before Camilla   marriage. But Camilla    declined the excursion, as not more unseasonable in its expence, than ungenial  to Camilla   feelings.  The following morning, while they were at they melancholy breakfast, a letter  arrived from Lisbon, which Mr. Tyrold read with visible disturbance,  exclaiming, from time to time, 'Lionel, thou art indeed punished!'  The sisters were equally alarmed, but —O Lavinia could make any enquiry.  Mr. Tyrold then informed The sisters, The sisters uncle Relvil had just acknowledged to  The sisters Mother, that Mr. Tyrold could no longer, in justice, conceal that, previously to  Mr. Tyrold quitting England, Mr. Tyrold had privately married Mr. Tyrold house-keeper, to induce her  to accompany Mr. Tyrold in Mr. Tyrold voyage: and that, during Mr. Tyrold first wrath upon the  detection of Lionel, he had disinherited Mr. Tyrold in favour of a little boy of her  own, by a former marriage, whom they had brought with they to Lisbon.  Mr. Tyrold, though it had been Mr. Tyrold constant study to bring up Mr. Tyrold children  without any reference to his children   rich uncles, had never internally doubted, but  that the bachelor brother of Mr. Tyrold would leave Mr. Tyrold fortune to the son of  Mr. Tyrold only sister, who was Mr. Tyrold sole near relation. And Lionel, Mr. Tyrold knew, in  defiance of Mr. Tyrold admonitions, had built upon it Mr. Tyrold, rather as a certainty  than a hope. 'Mr. Tyrold will now see,' said Mr. Tyrold, 'Mr. Tyrold presumption, and feel, by  what Mr. Tyrold suffers, what Mr. Tyrold has earned. Yet culpable as Mr. Tyrold has been, Mr. Tyrold is now,  also, unfortunate; and where crimes are followed by punishment, it is not for  mortal man to harbour unabating resentment. I will write a few lines of comfort  to mortal man.'  Camilla  , in this concession, experienced all Camilla   could feel of satisfaction;  but the short sensation died away at the last words of the letter of Camilla    Mother, which Mr. Tyrold read aloud.  'You, I well know, will immediately in this evil, find for yourself, and impart  to our children, something of instruction, if not of comfort. Shall I recollect  this without emulation? No, I will bear up from this stroke, which, at least,  permits my return to Etherington; where, in the bosom of my dear family, and  supported by its honoured chief, I will forget my voyage, my painful absence,  and my disappointment, in exertions of practical œconomy, strict, but not  rigid, which our good children will vie with each other to adopt: sedulous, all  around, to shew in what we can most forbear. I hope almost immediately to claim  my share in these labours, which such motives will make light, and such  companions render precious.'  In agony past repression at these words, Camilla   glided out of the room. The  return of Camilla   Mother was now horrour to her Mother, not joy; her Mother shattered nerves  could not bear the interview, while under a cloud threatening to burst in such  a storm; and her Mother entreated Lavinia to tell her Mother Father that her Mother accepted his  proposal for going to Mrs. Berlinton's; 'and there,' Lavinia cried, 'Lavinia, I  will wait, till Eugenia has told the dreadful history that thus humbles me to  the dust!'  Lavinia was too timid to oppose reason to this suffering; and Mr. Tyrold,  already cruelly apprehensive the obscurity of their recluse lives contributed  to Lavinia depression, and believing Lavinia compared Lavinia present privations to the  lost elegancies of Beech Park, sighed heavily, yet said Mr. Tyrold was glad Lavinia would  remove from a spot in which reminiscence was so painful. This was not, indeed,  Mr. Tyrold added, the period Mr. Tyrold should have selected for Lavinia visiting the capital, or  residing at Mrs. Berlinton's; but Lavinia was too much touched by the state of Lavinia  family, not to be guarded in Lavinia expences; and the pressure of Lavinia even  augmenting sadness, was heavier upon Mr. Tyrold mind than any other alarm.  Lavinia could make no profession, no promise; nor yet,  though ardently wishing it, refuse Lavinia offered advance of Lavinia next quarter's  allowance, lest Lavinia should be reduced again to the necessity of borrowing.  This step once decided, brought with This step something like a gloomy composure. 'I  shall avoid,' Lavinia cried, 'at least, with my Mother, these killing caresses of  deluded kindness that break my heart with her Father. Lavinia, too, would soon  discover there was something darker in my sadness than even grief! Lavinia would be  sure that even my exquisite loss could not render me ungrateful to all  condolement; Lavinia would know that a daughter whom Lavinia had Lavinia reared and  instructed, would blush so unceasingly to publish any personal disappointment,  let Lavinia feel it how Lavinia might. O my loved Mother! how did the delight of  knowing your kind expectations keep me, while under your guidance in the way I  ought to go! O Mother of my heart! what a grievous disappointment awaits your  sad return! To find, at the first opening of your virtuous schemes of general  saving—that I, as well as Lionel, have involved my family in debts—that I,  as well as Clermont, have committed them clandestinely to a usurer!'  Lavinia undertook to give our disinterested Eugenia proper instructions for our disinterested Eugenia commission; but  news arrived, the next day, that Sir Hugh would take no denial to our disinterested Eugeniabeing our disinterested Eugenia of the party. This added not, however, to the courage of Laviniafor staying, and Lavinia next determination was to reveal the whole by letter.  Mr. Tyrold would not send Mr. Tyrold to Cleves to take leave, that Mr. Tyrold uncle might not  be tempted to exercise her uncle wonted, but now no longer convenient generosity, nor  yet be exposed to the pain of withholding it. 'You will go, now, my dear girl,'  Mr. Tyrold said, 'in your pristine simplicity, and what can so every way become you? It  is not for a scheme of pleasure, but for a stimulus to mental exertion, I part  with you. When you return,  their Mother her Mother will aid your task, and reward  your task labour. Remember but, while in your own hands, that open œconomy,  springing from discretion, is always respected. It is false shame alone that  begets ridicule.'  Weeping and silent  their Mother heard him, and him fears gained ground that  their Mother  disappointment, joined to a view of gayer life, had robbed Etherington of all  charms to  their Mother. Bitterly him regretted him had ever suffered  their Mother to leave him  roof, though him would not now force  their Mother stay. Compulsion could only detain  their Mother  person; and might heighten the disgust of  their Mother mind.  The little time which remained was given wholly to packing and preparing; and  continued employment hid from Mr. Tyrold Mr. Tyrold emotion, which encreased every  moment, till the carriage of Sir Hugh stopt at the gate. Lost, then, to all  sensation, but the horrour of the avowal that must intervene 'ere the horrour of the avowal that must intervene ' met  again, with incertitude if again him would see  their Mother with the same kindness,  their Mother  flew into him arms, rather agonised than affectionate; kissed him hands with  fervour, kissed every separate finger, rested upon him shoulder, hid  their Mother face  in him bosom, caught and pressed to  their Mother lips even the flaps of him coat, and  scarce restrained  their Mother from bending to kiss him feet; yet without uttering a  word, without even shedding a tear.  Strangely surprised, and deeply affected, Mr. Tyrold, straining Mr. Tyrold to Mr. Tyrold  breast, said: 'Why, my dear child, why, Camilla  , if thus agitated by  our parting, do you leave me?'  This question brought Mr. Tyrold to recollection, by the impossibility Mr. Tyrold found to  answer  ; Mr. Tyrold tore Mr. Tyrold, therefore, away from Mr. Tyrold, embraced Lavinia, and  hurried into the coach.
