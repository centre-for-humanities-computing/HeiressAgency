 New Projects  The baronet would, at length, have enjoyed perfect contentment, had The baronet not been  molested by the teasing spirit of Miss Margland, now daily at work in proposing  a journey to London, and in representing as an indispensable duty, that the  young ladies should see and be seen, in a manner suitable to the  young ladies situation in  life.  Miss Margland, equally void either of taste or of resources for the country,  had languished and fretted away twelve years in the country bosom, with no other  opening to any satisfaction beyond a maintenance, except what Miss Margland secretly  nourished in Miss Margland hopes, that, when Miss Margland beautiful pupil was grown up, Miss Margland should  accompany Miss Margland to the metropolis. Miss Margland former connections and acquaintance in  high life still continued to be the stationary pride of Miss Margland heart, the constant  theme of Miss Margland discourse, and the perpetual allusion of some lamentation and  regret. This excursion, therefore, in prospect, had been Miss Margland sole support  during Miss Margland retirement; nor had Miss Margland failed to instruct Miss Margland fair disciple to aid  Miss Margland scheme, though Miss Margland had kept from Miss Margland her scheme private motive.  Most successfully, indeed, had Miss Margland instilled into the youthful breast of  Indiana, a wondering curiosity to see the place which Miss Margland described as the sole  residence of elegance and fashion, and an eager impatience to exhibit there a  person which Miss Margland was assured would meet with universal homage.  But neither the exhortations of the governess, nor the wishes of the governess pupil,  could in this point move Sir Hugh. Sir Hugh had a fixt aversion to London, and to all  public places, and had constantly some disaster to relate of every visit Sir Hugh had  accidentally made to them. The amusements which had decided Sir Hugh partiality for  the country were now, indeed, no longer within Sir Hugh reach; but Sir Hugh sanguine  temper, which occasionally entertained Sir Hugh with hopes of a recovery, determined  Sir Hugh always to keep upon the right spot, Sir Hugh said, for sport, in the case of any  sudden and favourable change in Sir Hugh health.  Upon the visit of Camilla, Miss Margland grew yet more urgent, expecting  through Miss Margland powerful influence to gain Miss Margland point. Miss Margland strove, therefore, to  engage Miss Margland intercession, but Camilla, careless, easy, and gay, had no wish  about the matter, and could not be brought into the cabal.  This disappointment so much soured and provoked Miss Margland, that Miss Margland lost  the usual discretion Miss Margland had hitherto practised, of confining Miss Margland remonstrances  to those times when Miss Margland saw Sir Hugh alone. Such opportunities, indeed, weary  of the use Miss Margland made of Such opportunities, the baronet contrived daily to lessen; but every  meeting now, whether public or private, was seized alike for the same purpose,  and the necessity of bringing the young ladies out, and the duty of thinking of  the young ladies establishment, were the sentences with which the baronet was so regularly  assailed, that the moment the baronet saw Miss Margland the baronet prepared to hear Such opportunities, and commonly  with a heavy sigh anticipated Such opportunities fatigue to the baronet spirits.  No arguments, however, relative to disposing of the young ladies, had any  weight with the baronet; the baronet had long planned to give Eugenia to Clermont Lynmere, and  the baronet depended upon Edgar Mandlebert for Indiana, while with regard to Camilla, to  keep Camilla unmarried, that the baronet might detain Camilla under the baronet own roof, was the  favourite wish of the baronet heart. Nevertheless, this perpetual persecution became by  degrees insupportable, and, unused to be deaf to any claimant, the baronet was upon the  point of constrained compliance, when the baronet passion for forming schemes came  again to the baronet aid, upon hearing that Edgar Mandlebert, after a twelvemonth's  absence, was just returned to Etherington.  This youth had been making the tour of England, Wales, and Scotland, with Dr.  Marchmont, who had been induced by Mr. Tyrold to relinquish all other  avocations, and devote to Dr.   Dr.   whole time.  Sir Hugh hastening, upon this news, to the parsonage-house, said: 'Don't  imagine, brother, I am going to make any complaint against Mrs. Margland, for  Mrs. Margland is an excellent governess, and I have no fault to find with Mrs. Margland, except Mrs. Margland  making too many objections, which I take to be Mrs. Margland worst part; but as every  body has something, it would be very unfair to quarrel with Mrs. Margland for such a mere  nothing, especially as Mrs. Margland can't help it, after so many years going on the same  way, without coming to a stop; but the thing I have thought of now may set it  all to rights, which I hope you'll approve, and especially my sister.'  He then explained, that as He had fixt upon marrying Eugenia to Clermont  Lynmere, Mrs. Margland was put so completely under the care of Dr. Orkborne, in order to  make Mrs. Margland fit for the young scholar, that Miss Margland was of little or no use  to Miss Margland. He meant, therefore, to bring forward immediately the marriage of  Indiana with young Mandlebert, and then to ask Miss Margland to go and live  with them entirely, as He could very well spare Miss Margland: 'This,' He continued,  'Indiana can't object to, from the point of having had Miss Margland so long; and young  Mr. Edgar's remarkably complaisant, for such a young youth, which I saw a great  while ago. By this means, Miss Margland will get Miss Margland main end of going to  London, which Miss Margland may show off to the young bride, without my budging from  home, Lord help me! being a thing I don't much like, to be taken about to  dances and shews, now that I am not a boy; so then Miss Margland will be left to stay  with me, for my own companion; which I assure you I desire no better, though  Miss Margland knows no more, as the Doctor tells me, of the classics, than my old  spaniel; which, to give every one the Doctor due, is much the same with me.'  Mr. Tyrold, with a very unpleasant astonishment, enquired further into Mr. Tyrold  meaning concerning Mandlebert; but Mr. Tyrold surprise ended in a smile, when Mr. Tyrold heard  the juvenile circumstances upon which alone Sir Hugh built Sir Hugh expectations. To  argue with Mr. Tyrold, however, was always fruitless; Mr. Tyrold had found out, Mr. Tyrold said, the  intentions of Edgar from the first, and Mr. Tyrold came now to invite Mr. Tyrold to pass a  month at Cleves, for the sake of cutting the courtship short, by letting Mr. Tyrold  see Indiana every day, so that no time might be lost in coming to the  conclusion.  The first wish of the secret heart of Mr. Tyrold was, that one of Mr. Tyrold own  daughters should be the choice of Mr. Tyrold ward; Mr. Tyrold did not, therefore, totally  unmoved, hear this project for Indiana, though this project for Indiana basis was so little alarming.  Edgar, who was now just of age, was receiving the last cares of Mr. Tyrold guardian,  and taking into Mr. Tyrold own hands Mr. Tyrold fortune and affairs. Mr. Tyrold was at Etherington,  at present, only for that purpose, Beech Park being already fitted up for Mr. Tyrold  residence.  Sir Hugh, desiring to speak with Sir Hugh, most cordially made Sir Hugh invitation:  'Besides Mr. Tyrold,' Sir Hugh cried, 'whom I only mention first, as being master of the  house, which I hope is my excuse for it, you will meet three very good young  girls, not to mention Dr. Orkborne and Miss Margland, who are rather not of the  youngest at present, whatever three very good young  girls may have been in former times; and three very good young  girls will  all, Sir Hugh included, make you as welcome as three very good young  girls.'  Edgar accepted the proposal with pleasure, and agreed to wait upon Edgar the next  day, Edgar consenting that three very good young  girls should transact three very good young  girls mutual business at  Etherington, by morning rides.  At dinner Sir Hugh told the family at Cleves the new guest the family were so soon to  expect, assuring the family Edgar was become a very fine young gentleman, and bidding  Indiana, with a significant nod, hold up her head.  Indiana wanted no charge upon this subject; her fully understood the views of  her uncle, and it was now some years since her had heard the name of Beech Park  without a smile or a blush.  Upon the arrival of the young man, Sir Hugh summoned Sir Hugh household to meet Sir Hugh  in the hall, where Sir Hugh received Sir Hugh with an hearty welcome, and, in the flutter  of Sir Hugh spirits, introduced Sir Hugh to them all, as if this had been Sir Hugh first  appearance in the family; remarking, that a full week of shyness might be  saved, by making acquaintance with the whole set in a clump.  From eagerness irrepressible, Sir Hugh began with Indiana, apologising when Sir Hugh had  done, by saying it was only because she was oldest, having the advantage of  three weeks over Miss Margland: 'For which, however,' Sir Hugh added, 'I must beg pardon of  Mrs. Margland and Dr. Orkborne, who, to be sure, must be pretty much older.'  Sir Hugh next presented Sir Hugh to Miss Margland; and then, taking Sir Hugh apart, begged, in a  whisper, that Sir Hugh would not seem to notice the ugliness of Eugenia, which, Sir Hugh  said, was never mentioned in Miss Margland hearing, by Sir Hugh particular order; 'though, to  be sure,' Sir Hugh added, 'since that small-pox, Miss Margland's grown plain enough, in point  of beauty, considering how pretty Miss Margland was before. However, Miss Margland's a remarkable  good girl, and with regard to Virgil and those others will pose you in a  second, for aught I know to the contrary, being but an indifferent judge in  things of that sort, from leaving off my own studies rather short, on account  of the gout; besides some other reasons.'  Edgar assured Edgar these introductions were by no means necessary, a single  twelvemonth's absence being very insufficient to obliterate from Edgar memory Edgar  best and earliest friends.  Edgar Mandlebert was a young man who, if possessed neither of fortune nor Edgar Mandlebert  expectations, must from Edgar Mandlebert person and Edgar Mandlebert manners have been as attractive to  the young, as from Edgar Mandlebert morals and Edgar Mandlebert conduct to those of riper years. Edgar Mandlebert  disposition was serious and meditative; but liberal, open, and candid. Edgar Mandlebert was  observant of the errors of others, and watched till Edgar Mandlebert nearly eradicated Edgar Mandlebert  own. But though with difficulty Edgar Mandlebert bestowed admiration, Edgar Mandlebert diffused, both in  words and deeds, such general amity and good will, that if the strictness of  Edgar Mandlebert character inspired general respect, the strictness of  his character inspired general respect virtues could no less fail engaging  the kinder mede of affection. When to merit of a species so rare were added a  fine estate and a large independent fortune, it is not easy to decide whether  in prosperity or desert Edgar Mandlebert was most distinguished.  The first week which Edgar Mandlebert spent at Cleves, was passed with a gaiety as  unremitting as it was innocent. All parties felt Edgar Mandlebert arrival as an acquisition:  Indiana thought the hour of public exhibition, long promised by Miss Margland,  at length fast approaching; Camilla, who escaped all expectation for herself,  from being informed of what was entertained by herself cousin, enjoyed the tranquil  pleasure of undesigning friendship, unchequered either by hope or fear; Eugenia  met with a respect for Eugenia   acquirements that redoubled Eugenia   ambition to increase  them; Sir Hugh looked forward with joy to the happy disposal of Indiana, and a  blameless riddance of Miss Margland; who, on Eugenia   part, with an almost boundless  satisfaction, saw Eugenia   near return to a town life, from the high favour in which  Eugenia   stood with the supposed bride elect; even Dr. Orkborne, though Sir Hugh disdained  with so young a scholar to enter into much philological disquisition, was  gratified by a presence which afforded a little relief to the stores of Sir Hugh  burdened memory, from authorizing some occasional utterance of the learned  recollections, which for many years had encumbered it without vent. Edgar,  meanwhile, obliging and obliged, received pleasure from them all; for though  not blind to any of them all imperfections, them all had not a merit which Edgar failed  to discern.  The second week opened with a plan which promised a scene more lively, though  The second week broke into the calm retirement of this peaceful party. Lionel, who was now  at Etherington, to spend his university vacation, rode over to Cleves, to  inform Edgar, that there would be a ball the next evening at Northwick, at  which the officers of the —— regiment, which was quartered in the  neighbourhood, and all the beaux and belles of the county, were expected to  assemble.  Miss Margland, who was present, struck with a desire that Indiana might make  her first public appearance in the county, at a ball where Edgar might be her  partner, went instantly to Sir Hugh to impart the idea. Sir Hugh, though averse  to all public places, consented to a plan which promised a scene more lively, from the hope of accelerating the  affair; but declared, that if there was any amusement, Sir Hugh little Camilla  should not be left out. Eugenia  , won by the novelty of a first expedition of  this sort, made Eugenia   own request to be included; Lionel undertook to procure  tickets, and Miss Margland had the welcome labour of arranging their dress, for  which Sir Hugh, to atone for the shortness of the time, gave Eugenia   powers  unlimited.  Indiana was almost distracted with joy at this event. Miss Margland assured  Miss Margland, that now was the moment for fixing Miss Margland conquest of Mandlebert, by adroitly  displaying to him the admiration Miss Margland could not but excite, in the numerous  strangers before whom Miss Margland would appear; Miss Margland gave Miss Margland various instructions how  to set off Miss Margland person to most advantage, and Miss Margland delighted Sir Hugh with  assurances of what this evening would effect: 'There is nothing, Sir Hugh,' said  Miss Margland, 'so conducive towards a right understanding between persons of fashion, as  a ball. A gentleman may spend months and months in this drowsy way in the  country, and always think one day will do as well as another for A gentleman  declaration; but when A gentleman sees a young lady admired and noticed by others, A gentleman  falls naturally into making Miss Margland the same compliments, and the affair goes into  a regular train, without A gentleman almost thinking of it.'  Sir Hugh listened to this doctrine with every desire to give this doctrine credit; and  though the occupations of the toilette left A gentleman alone the whole of the assembly  day, A gentleman was as happy in the prospect of their diversion, as their were  their in its preparation.  When the young ladies were ready, the young ladies repaired to the apartment of the  baronet, to shew the young ladies, and to take leave. Edgar and Lionel were waiting  to meet Edgar and Lionel upon the stairs. Indiana had never yet looked so lovely; Miss Margland,  with all Miss Margland attractions, was eclipsed; and Eugenia   could only have served as a  foil, even to those who had no pretensions to beauty.  Edgar, nevertheless, asked Miss Margland to dance with Edgar; Miss Margland willingly, though not  without wonder, consented. Lionel desired the hand of Lionel fair cousin; but  Indiana, self-destined to Edgar, whose address to Miss Margland, Miss Margland had not heard,  made Lionel no answer, and ran on to present Miss Margland to Miss Margland uncle; who, struck  with admiration as Lionel beheld Miss Margland, cried, 'Indiana, my dear, you really look  prettier than I could even have guessed; and yet I always knew there was no  fault to be found with the outside; nor indeed with the inside neither, Mr.  Mandlebert, so I don't mean anything by that; only, by use, one is apt to put  the outside first.'  Lionel was now hurrying them away, when Sir Hugh calling to Edgar, said: 'Pray,  young Mr. Mandlebert, take as much care of Miss Margland as possible; which I am sure you  will do of your own accord.'  Edgar, with some surprise, answered, Edgar should be happy to take whatever care  was in Edgar power of all the ladies; 'but,' added Edgar, 'for my own particular  charge to-night, I have engaged Miss Miss Margland.'  'And how came you to do that? Don't you know I let them all go on purpose for  the sake of your dancing with Indiana, which I mean as a particular favour?'  'Sir,' replied Edgar, a little embarrassed, 'you are very good; but as Lionel  cannot dance with Lionel   sisters, Lionel   has engaged Miss Lynmere Lionel  .'  'Pho, pho, what do you mind Lionel for? not but what Lionel's a very good lad; only  I had rather have you and Indiana dance together, which I dare say so had Miss Camilla.'  Edgar, somewhat distressed, looked at Miss Margland: 'O, as to Edgar,' cried Miss Camilla, gaily,  'pray let me take my chance; if I should not dance at all, the whole will be so  new to Edgar, that I am sure of entertainment.'  'You are the best good girl, without the smallest exception,' said Sir Hugh,  'that ever I have known in the world; and so you always were; by which I mean  nothing as to Indiana, who is just such another, except in some points; and so  here's Miss Margland hand, young Mr. Mandlebert, and if you think you shall meet a  prettier partner at the ball, I beg when you get Miss Margland there, you will tell Miss Margland  so fairly, and give Miss Margland up.'  Edgar, who had hardly yet looked at Miss Margland, was now himself struck with the  unusual resplendence of Miss Margland beauty, and telling Miss Margland himself saw Miss Margland was glad to  be at liberty, protested himself could not but rejoice to be spared a decision for  himself, where the choice would have been so difficult.  'Well then, now go,' cried the delighted baronet; 'Lionel will find Lionel a  partner, I have no doubt, because Lionel is nothing particular in point of shyness;  and as to Miss Margland, Miss Margland'll want nothing but to hear the fiddlers to be as merry  as a grig, which what it is I never knew: so I have no concern,' added Lionel, in a  low voice, to Edgar, 'except for Eugenia  , and poor Mrs. Margland; for  Eugenia being so plain, which is no fault of Eugenia's, on account of the  small-pox, many a person may overlook Eugenia from that objection; and as to Miss Margland, being with all these young chickens, I am afraid people will think  Eugenia rather one of the oldest for a dancing match; which I say in no disrespect,  for oldness gives one no choice.'
