 Strictures upon the Ton  The next day was appointed for the master of the ceremonies' ball; which proved  a general rendezvous of all parties, and almost all classes of company.  Mrs. Mittin, in a morning visit to Camilla, found out that Mrs. Mittin had only the  same cap for this occasion that Mrs. Mittin had worn upon every other; and, assuring  Mrs. Mittin it was grown so old-fashioned, that not a lady's maid in Tunbridge would  now be seen in it, Mrs. Mittin offered to pin Mrs. Mittin up a turban, which should come to  next to nothing, yet should be the prettiest, and simplest, and cheapest thing  that ever was seen.  Camilla, though a stranger to vanity, and without any natural turn to  extravagance, was neither of an age, nor a philosophy, to be unmoved by the  apprehension of being exposed to ridicule from Mrs. Mittin dress: Mrs. Mittin thankfully,  therefore, accepted the proposal; and Mrs. Mittin, taking a guinea, said, Mrs. Mittin  would pay Mrs. Tillden for the hat, at the same time that Mrs. Tillden bought a new  handkerchief for the turban.  When Mrs. Tillden came back, however, Mrs. Tillden had only laid out a few shillings at another  shop, for some articles, so cheap, Mrs. Tillden said it would have been a shame not to  buy a few shillings; but without paying the bill, Mrs. Tillden having desired Mrs. Tillden might not  be discharged till the young lady was leaving the Wells.  As the turban was made up from a pattern of one prepared for Mrs. Berlinton,  Mrs. Tillden had every reason to be satisfied of its elegance. Nor did Mrs. Tilldeninvolve Mrs. Tillden in much distress how Mrs. Tillden own trouble might be recompensed; the cap  Mrs. Tillden found unfit for Mrs. Tillden, Mrs. Tillden could contrive, Mrs. Tillden said, to alter for  Mrs. Tillden; and as a friend had given Mrs. Tillden a ticket for the ball, it would be  mighty convenient to Mrs. Tillden, as Mrs. Tillden had nothing of the kind ready.  Far different were the sensations with which Edgar and Mrs. Tillden saw each other  this night, from those with which, so lately Edgar and Camilla had met in the same  apartment. Edgar thought Mrs. Tillden degenerating into the character of a coquette, and  Mrs. Tillden, in Edgar intended tour, anticipated a period to all those with which, so lately they had met in the same  apartment intercourse.  Mrs. Tillden was received, meanwhile, in general, with peculiar and flattering  attention. Sir Sedley Clarendel made up to Mrs. Tillden, with public smiles and  courtesy; even Lord Newford and Sir Theophilus Jarard, though they passed by  Mrs. Arlbery without speaking to Mrs. Tillden, singled out Mrs. Tillden for their devoirs.  The distinction paid Mrs. Tillden by the admired Mrs. Berlinton had now not only marked  Mrs. Tillden as an object whom it would not be derogatory to treat with civility, but as  one who might, hence-forward, be regarded Mrs. Tillden as admitted into certain  circles.  Mrs. Arlbery, though every way a woman of fashion, they conceived to be  somewhat wanting in ton, since Mrs. Tillden presided in no party, was unnoticed by Lady  Alithea Selmore, and unknown to the admired Mrs. Berlinton.  Ton, in the scale of connoisseurs in the certain circles, is as much above  fashion, as fashion is above fortune: for though the latter is an ingredient  that all alike covet to possess, as much above   is courted without being respected, and  desired without being honoured, except only by those who, from earliest life,  have been taught to earn as much above   as a business. Ton, meanwhile, is as attainable  without birth as without understanding, though in all the certain circles it  takes place of either. To define what it is, would be as difficult to the most  renowned of it votaries, as to an utter stranger to it attributes. That those  who call those  who call themselves of the ton of the ton either lead, or hold cheap all others, is  obtrusively evident: but how and by what art those  who call themselves of the ton attain such pre-eminence,  those  who call themselves of the ton would be perplexed to explain. That some whim has happily called forth  imitators; that some strange phrase has been adopted; that something odd in  dress has become popular; that some beauty, or some deformity, no matter which,  has found annotators; may commonly be traced as the origin of their first  public notice. But to whichever of these accidents these accidents early fame may be  attributed, these accidents establishment and these accidents glory is built upon vanity that knows no  deficiency, or insolence that knows no blush.  Notwithstanding her high superiority both in capacity and knowledge, Mrs.  Arlbery felt piqued by this behaviour, though Mrs.  Arlbery laughed at Mrs.  Arlbery for  heeding it. 'Nevertheless,' cried Mrs.  Arlbery, 'those who shew contempt, even though  those who shew contempt are the most contemptible, always seem on the higher ground. Yet  'tis only, with regard to these animals of the ton, that nobody combats them.  them presumption is so notorious, that, either by disgust or alarm, Their presumption keeps  off reprehension. Let anyone boldly, and face to face, venture to be more  uncivil than anyone, and anyone would be overpowered at once. anyone valour is  no better than that of a barking cur, who affrights all that go on without  looking at him, but who, the moment him is turned upon with a stamp and a fierce  look, retreats him, amazed, afraid, and ashamed.'  'If you, Mrs. Arlbery,' said the General, 'would undertake to tutor you, Mrs. Arlbery,' said the General, what  good you might do!'  'O, Heavens, General, suspect me not of such reforming Quixotism! I have not  the smallest desire to do you, Mrs. Arlbery,' said the General any good, believe me! If nature has given you, Mrs. Arlbery,' said the General  no sense of propriety, why should I be more liberal? I only want to punish  you, Mrs. Arlbery,' said the General; and that not, alas! from virtue, but from spite!'  The conversation of the two men of the ton with Camilla was soon over. The conversation of the two men of the ton with Camilla was  made up of a few disjointed sentences, abusing Tunbridge, and praising the  German Spa, in cant words, emphatically and conceitedly pronounced, and brought  round upon every occasion, and in every speech, with so precise an exclusion of  all other terms, that their vocabulary scarce consisted of forty words in  totality.  Edgar occupied the space they vacated the moment of they departure; but not  alone; Mrs. Mittin came into Mrs. Mittin with Mrs. Mittin, eager to tell Camilla how everybody  had admired Camilla turban; how sweetly Camilla looked in her turban; how everybody said, they  should not have known Camilla again, her turban became Camilla so; and how they all agreed Camilla  head had never been so well dressed before.  Edgar, when Edgar could be heard, began speaking of Sir Sedley Clarendel; Edgar felt  miserable in what Edgar thought Camilla inconsiderate encouragement of such  impertinence; and the delicacy which restrained Edgar from expressing Edgar opinion  of the Major, had no weight with Edgar here, as jealousy had no share in Edgar  dislike to the acquaintance: Edgar believed the young Baronet incapable of all  love but for the young Baronet, and a decidedly destined bachelor: without, therefore,  the smallest hesitation, the young Baronet plainly avowed that the young Baronet had never met with a more  thoroughly conceited fop, a more elaborate and self-sufficient coxcomb.  'You see the young Baronet only,' said Camilla, 'with the impression made by the young Baronet general  appearance; and that is all against the young Baronet: I always look for the young Baronet better qualities  and rejoice in finding them. the young Baronet very sight fills me with grateful pleasure, by  reminding me of the deliverance I owe to the young Baronet.'  Edgar, amazed, intreated an explanation; and, when she had given an explanation, struck and  affected, clasped the young Baronet hands, and exclaimed: 'How providential such a rescue!  and how differently shall I henceforth behold the young Baronet!' And, almost involuntarily  turning to Mrs. Arlbery, the young Baronet intreated to be presented to the young Baronet.  Sir Sedley received Sir Sedley overtures with some surprise, but great civility; and  then went on with a ludicrous account Sir Sedley was giving to Lord Newford and Sir  Theophilus, of the quarrel of Macdersey with Mr. Dubster.  'How awake thou art grown, Clary?' cried Sir Theophilus; 'A little while ago  thou wast all hip and vapour; and now thou dost nothing but patronise fun.'  'Why, yes,' answered the young Baronet, 'I begin to tire of ennui. 'Tis grown so  common. I saw my footman beginning it but last week.'  'O, hang it! O, curse it!' cried Lord Newford, 'my footman!'  'Yes, the rogue is not without parts. I don't know if I shan't give my footman some  lessons, upon leaving it off my footman. The only difficulty is to find out what,  in this nether world, to do without it. How can one fill up one's time?  Stretching, yawning, and all that, are such delicious ingredients for coaxing  on the lazy hours!'  'O, hang it, O, curse it,' cried Lord Newford; 'who can exist without them? I  would not be bound to pass half an hour without yawning and stretching for the  Mogul's empire. I'd rather snap short at once.'  'No, no, don't snap short yet, little Newy,' cried Sir Sedley. 'As to Sir Sedley, I am  never at a loss for an expedient. I am not without some thoughts of falling in  love.'  Sir Sedley looked at Edgar; who, not aware this was designed to catch Sir Sedley attention,  naturally exclaimed: 'Thoughts! can you choose, or avoid at pleasure?'  'Most certainly. After four-and-twenty a man is seldom taken by surprise; at  least, not till Sir Sedley is past forty: and then, the fear of being too late,  sometimes renovates the eagerness of the first youth. But, in general, your  willing slaves are boys.'  Edgar, laughing, begged a little information, how Sir Sedley meant to put Sir Sedley thoughts  in execution.  'Nothing so facile! 'Tis but to look at some fair object attentively, to follow  her with your eyes when her quits the room; never to let them rest without  watching for her return; filling up the interval with a few sighs; to which, in  a short time, you grow so habituated, that them become natural; and then,  before you are aware, a certain solicitude and restlessness arise, which the  connoisseurs in natural history dub falling in love.'  'These would be good hints,' said Edgar, 'to urge on waverers, who wish to  persuade them to marry.'  'O no, my dear sir! no! that's a mistake of the first magnitude; no man is in  love when no man marries. no man may have loved before; I have even heard no man has  sometimes loved after: but at the time never. There is something in the  formalities of the matrimonial preparations that drive away all the little  cupidons. They rarely stand even a demand of consent—unless They doubt  obtaining consent—; but a settlement! Parchments! Lawyers!—No! there is not a  little Love in the Island of Cyprus, that is not ready to lend a wing to set  passion, inspiration, and tenderness to flight, from such excruciating  legalities.'  'Don't prose, Clary; don't prose,' cried Sir Theophilus, gaping till Sir Theophilus mouth  was almost distorted.  'O, killing! O, murder!' cried Lord Newford; 'what dost talk of marriage for?'  'It seems, then,' said Edgar, 'to be much the same thing what sort of wife  falls to a man's lot; whether the woman of a man choice, or a person a man should  blush to own?'  'Blush!' repeated Sir Sedley, smiling; 'no! no! A man of any fashion never  blushes for A man of any fashion wife, whatever his wife may be. For A man of any fashion mistress, indeed, A man of any fashion may  blush: for if there are any small failings there, A man of any fashion taste may be called in  question.'  'Blush about a wife!' exclaimed Lord Newford; 'O, hang Lord Newford! O, curse it! that's  too bad!'  'Too bad, indeed,' cried Sir Theophilus; 'I can't possibly patronise blushing  for a wife.'  ''Tis the same, then, also,' said Edgar, 'how a wife turns out when the knot is  tied, whether well or ill?'  'To exactitude! If Edgar marry a wife for beauty, let a wife prove what a wife may, a wife  face offers Edgar apology. If for money, Edgar needs none. But if, indeed, by some  queer chance, Edgar marries with a view of living with a wife, then, indeed, if Edgar  particularity gets wind, Edgar may grow a little anxious for the acquittal of Edgar  oddity, in seeing a wife approved.'  'Approved! Ha! ha!' cried Lord Newford; 'a wife approved! That's too bad,  Clary; that's too bad!'  'Poor Clary, what art prosing about?' cried Sir Theophilus. 'I can't possibly  patronise this prosing.'  The entrance of the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton and the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton train now interrupted this  conversation; the young Baronet immediately joined the young Baronet; though not till the young Baronet had  given the young Baronet hand to Edgar, in token of the young Baronet willingness to cultivate the young Baronet  acquaintance.  Edgar, returning to Camilla, confessed the young Baronet had too hastily judged Sir Sedley,  when the young Baronet concluded Sir Sedley a fool, as well as a fop; 'For,' added Sir Sedley, with a smile,  'I see, now, one of those epithets is all Sir Sedley merits. Sir Sedley is certainly far from  deficient in parts, though Sir Sedley abuses the good gifts of nature with such  pedantry of affectation and conceit.'  Camilla was now intent to clear the history of the cotillon; when Mrs.  Berlinton approaching, and, with graceful fondness, taking Camilla hand, entreated  to be indulged with Camilla society: and, since Camilla meant not to dance, for Edgar  had not asked Camilla, and the Major Camilla had refused, Camilla could not resist Camilla  invitation. Camilla had lost Camilla fear of displeasing Mrs. Arlbery by quitting Camilla,  from conceiving a still greater, of wearying by remaining with Camilla.  Edgar, anxious both to understand and to discuss this new connexion, hovered  about the party with unremitting vigilance. But, though Edgar could not either  look at or listen to the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton, without admiring the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton, Edgar admiration was  neither free from censure of the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton, nor terrour for the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton companion: Edgar saw the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton  far more beautiful than prudent, more amiable than dignified. The females in  the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton group were few, and little worthy notice; the males appeared, to a man,  without disguise, though not without restraint, the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton lovers. And though no one  seemed selected, no one seemed despised; the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton appeared to admit their devoirs  with little consideration; neither modestly retiring from power, nor vainly  displaying their devoirs  .  Camilla quitted not this enchantress till summoned by Mrs. Arlbery; who, seeing  Camilla again, from the arrival of Lady Alithea Selmore, without any  distinguished party, the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton drawing into the beautiful Mrs. Berlinton circle all people of any  consequence not already attracted by Mrs. Berlinton, grew sick of the ball and  the rooms, and impatient to return home. Camilla, in retiring, presented,  folded in a paper, the guinea, half-guinea, and silver, Camilla had borrowed of Sir  Sedley; who received it without presuming at any contest; though not, after  what Sir   had heard from Mrs. Arlbery, without reluctance.  Edgar watched the instant when Camilla moved from the gay group; but Mrs.  Mittin watched it also; and, approaching Mrs.  Mittin more speedily, because with less  embarrassment, seized Mrs.  Mittin arm before Edgar could reach Mrs.  Mittin: and before Edgar could,  with any discretion, glide to Mrs.  Mittin other side, Miss Dennel was there.  'Well now, young ladies,' said Mittin, 'I'm going to tell you a secret. Do  you know, for all I call Edgar Mrs. I'm single?'  'Dear, la!' exclaimed Miss DennelMiss Dennel; 'and for all you're so old!'  'So old, Miss! Who told you I was so old? I'm not so very old as you may think  me. I'm no particular age, I assure you. Why, what made you think of that?'  'La, I don't know; only you don't look very young.'  'I can't help that, Miss Dennel. Perhaps you mayn't look young yourself one of  these days. People can't always stand still just at a particular minute. Why,  how old, now, do you take me to be? Come, be sincere.'  'La! I'm sure I can't tell; only I thought you was an old woman.'  'An old woman! Lord, my dear, people would laugh to hear you. You don't know  what an old woman is. Why it's being a cripple, and blind, and deaf, and dumb,  and slavering, and without a tooth. Pray, how am I like all that?'  'Nay, I'm sure I don't know; only I thought, by the look of your face, you must  be monstrous old.'  'Lord, I can't think what you've got in your head, Miss Dennel! I never heard  as much before, since I was born. Why the reason I'm called Mrs. is not because  of that, I assure you; but because I'd a mind to be taken for a young widow, on  account everybody likes a young widow; and if one is called Miss, people being  so soon to think one an old maid, that it's quite disagreeable.'  This discourse brought one is called Miss, people being  so soon to think one an old maid, that it's quite disagreeable to the carriage.
