 Ways to the Heart  All pleasure to Camilla was completely over from the moment that Edgar  disappeared.  When she returned to Mount Pleasant, Mrs. Arlbery, whom she found alone, said,  'Did I not understand that you were going to dance with Mr. Mandlebert? How  chanced he to leave you? We were kept ages waiting for the coach; and I saw him  pass by, and walk off.'  Camilla, colouring, related the history of the cotillon; and said, she feared,  not knowing how she had been circumstanced, he was displeased.  'Displeased!' cried Mrs. Arlbery, laughing; 'and do you, at seventeen, suffer a  man to be displeased? How can you do worse when you are fifty? Know your own  power more truly, and use it better. Men, my dear, are all spoilt by humility,  and all conquered by gaiety. Amuse and defy them!â€”attend to that maxim, and  you will have the world at your feet.'  'I have no such ambition: ... but I should be sensibly hurt to make an old  friend think ill of me.'  'When an old friend,' said Mrs. Arlbery, archly, 'happens to be a young man,  you must conduct yourself with him a little like what you are; that is, a young  woman. And a young woman is never in her proper place, if such sort of old  friends are not taught to know their own. From the instant you permit them to  think of being offended, they become your masters; and you will find it vastly  more convenient to make them your slaves.'  Camilla pretended to understand this in a mere general sense, and wished her  good night.  The next morning, at an early hour, her chamber door was opened with great  suddenness, and no preparation, and Mrs. Mittin tript nimbly into the room,  with a hat in her hand.  'Look here! my dear Miss Tyrold,' cried she, 'for now that other young lady has  told me your name, and I writ it down upon paper, that I might not forget it  again: look at your hat now! Did you ever see anything so much improved for the  better? I declare nobody would know it! Miss Dennel says it's as pretty again  as it was at first. I'll go and shew it to the other lady.'  Away she went, triumphant, with the trophy of her notability; but presently  returned, saying, 'Do, pray, Miss Tyrold, write me down that other lady's name  upon a scrap of paper. It always goes out of my head. And one looks as if one  knew nobody, when, one forgets people's names.'  Camilla complied, and expressed her shame to have caused her so much trouble.  'O, my dear, it's none at all. I got all the things at Mrs. Tillden's.'  'Who is Mrs. Tillden?' cried Camilla, staring.  'Why the milliner. Don't you know that?'  'What things?' asked Camilla, alarmed.  'Why these, my dear; don't you see? Why it's all new, except just the hat  itself, and the feathers.'  Camilla was now in extreme embarrassment. She had concluded Mrs. Mittin had  only newly arranged the ornaments, and had not the smallest idea of incurring a  debt which she had no means to discharge.  'It all comes to quite a trifle,' continued Mrs. Mittin, 'for all it's so  pretty. Mrs. Tillden's things are all monstrous cheap. I get things for next to  nothing from her, sometimes, when they are a little past the mode. But then I  recommend her a heap of customers. I get all my friends, by hook or by crook,  to go to her shop.'  'And what,' stammered out Camilla, 'besides my thanks, do I owe you?'  'Oh nothing. She would not be paid; she said, as you was her customer, and had  all your things of her at first, she'd put it down in your bill for the season.'  This was, at least, some respite; though Camilla felt the disagreeable  necessity of increasing her intended demand upon Mrs. Arlbery.  Miss Dennel came with a summons from that lady to the Pantiles, whither, as the  day was fine, she proposed they should walk.  'O,' cried Mrs. Mittin, 'if you are going upon the Pantiles, you must go to  that shop where there's the curious ear-rings that are be to raffled for.  You'll put in to be sure.'  Camilla said no, with a sigh attributed to the ear-rings, but due to a tender  recollection of the raffle in which Edgar had procured her the trinket she most  valued. Mrs. Mittin proposed accompanying them, and asked Camilla to introduce  her to Mrs. Arlbery. This was very disagreeable; but she knew not how, after  the civility she owed her, to refuse.  Mrs. Arlbery received her with much surprize, but perfect unconcern; conscious  of her own importance, she feared no disgrace from being seen with one in a  lower station; and she conceived it no honour to appear with one in a higher.  When they came to the Pantiles, Mrs. Mittin begged to introduce them to a view  of the ear-rings, which belonged, she said, to one of her particular friends;  and as Mrs. Arlbery caught the eye of Sir Sedley Clarendel in passing the  window, she entered the shop.  'Well,' cried Mrs. Mittin, to its master, 'don't say I bring you no company. I  am sure you ought to let me throw for nothing, if it's only for good luck; for  I am sure these three ladies will all put in. Come, Miss Dennel, do lead the  way. 'Tis but half a guinea, and only look what a prize.'  'Ask papa to pay for me!' cried Miss Dennel.  'Come, good sir, come, put down the half guinea for the young lady. I'm sure  you can't refuse her. Lord! what's half a guinea?'  'That's a very bad way of reasoning,' answered Mr. Dennel; 'and what I did not  expect from a woman of your sense.'  'Why you don't think, sir, I meant that half a guinea's a trifle? No indeed! I  know what money is better than that. I only mean half a guinea is nothing in  comparison to ten guineas, which is the price of the ear-rings; and so that  makes me think it's pity the young lady should lose an opportunity of getting  them so cheap. I'm sure if they were dear, I should be the last to recommend  them, for I think extravagance the greatest sin under the sun.'  'Well, now you speak like the sensible woman I took you for.'  A very little more eloquence of this sort was necessary, before Mr. Dennel put  down half a guinea.  'Well, I declare,' cried Mrs. Mittin, 'there's only three more names wanted;  and when these two ladies have put in, there will be only one! I'm sure if I  was rich enough, that one would not be far off. But come, ma'am, where's your  half guinea? Come, Miss Tyrold, don't hold back; who knows but you may win?  there's only nineteen against you. Lord, what's that?'  Camilla turned away, and Mrs. Arlbery did not listen to a word; but when Sir  Sedley said, 'They are really very pretty; won't you throw?' she answered, 'I  must rather make a raffle with my own trinkets, than raffle for other people's.  Think of my ponies! However, I'll put in, if Mr. Dennel will be my paymaster.'  Mr. Dennel, turning short off, walked out of the shop.  'This is a bad omen!' cried she, laughing; and then desired to look at the list  of rafflers; when seeing amongst the names those of Lady Alithea Selmore and  the Hon. Mrs. Berlinton, she exclaimed: ''Tis a coalition of all fashion and  reputation! We shall be absolutely scouted, my dear Miss Tyrold, if we shrink.  My poor ponies must wait half a guinea longer! Let us put in together.'  Camilla answered, she had no intention to try for them.  'Well, then, lend me half a guinea; for I never trust myself, now, with my  purse.'  'I have not a half guinea ... I have ... I have no ... gold ... in my purse,'  answered Camilla, with a face deeply tinged with red.  Major Cerwood, who joined the party during this discussion, intreated to be  banker for both the ladies. Camilla positively refused any share; but Mrs.  Mittin said it would be a shame for such a young lady to go without her chance,  and wrote down her name next to that of Mrs. Arlbery; while the Major, without  further question, put down a guinea upon the counter.  Camilla could not endure this; yet, from a youthful shame of confessing  poverty, forced herself to the ear of Mrs. Arlbery, and whispered an entreaty  that she would pay the guinea herself.  Mrs. Arlbery, surprized, answered she had really come out without her purse;  but seeing her seriously vexed, added, 'If you do not approve of the Major for  a banker till we go home, what say you to Sir Sedley?'  'I shall prefer him a thousand times!'  Mrs. Arlbery, in a low voice, repeated this to the young Baronet, and receiving  his guinea, threw it down; making the Major, without the smallest excuse or  ceremony, take back his own.  This was by no means lost upon Sir Sedley; he felt flattered ... he felt  softened; he thought Camilla looked unusually lovely; he began to wonder at the  coldness of Mandlebert, and to lament that the first affections of so fair a  creature should be cast away.  Mandlebert himself was an object of nothing less than envy. He had entered the  shop during the contest about the raffle, and seen Major Cerwood pay for  Camilla as well as for Mrs. Arlbery. Confirmed in his notions of her positive  engagement, and sick at heart from the confirmation, he walked further into the  shop, upon pretence of looking at some other articles, before he could assume  sufficient composure to speak to her.  Mrs. Mittin now began woefully to repine that she could not take the last share  for the ear-rings; and, addressing herself to Mr. Dennel, who re-entered as  soon as he saw the money was paid for Mrs. Arlbery, she said, 'You see, sir, if  there was somebody ready to take the last chance at once, this gentleman might  fix a day for the throwing immediately; but else, it may be dawdled on, nobody  knows how long; for one will be gone, and t'other will be gone, and there'll be  no getting the people together; and all the pleasure of the thing is being here  to throw for one's self: for I don't much like trusting money matters out of  sight.'  'If I'd thought of all that,' said Mr. Dennel, 'I should not have put in.'  'True, sir. But here, if it was not that I don't happen to have half a guinea  to spare just now, how nicely it might all be finished in a trice! For, as I  have been saying to Miss Dennel, this may turn out a real bargain; for they'll  fetch their full value at any time. And I tell Miss Dennel that's the only way  to lay out money, upon things that will bring it back again if it's wanted; not  upon frippery froppery, that's spoilt in a minute, and then i'n't worth a  farthing.'  'Very sensibly said,' cried Mr. Dennel; 'I'm sure she can't hear better advice;  I'm much obliged to you for putting such sensible thoughts into her head.' And  then, hoping she would continue her good lessons to his daughter, he drew out  his purse, and begged her to accept a chance from it for the prize.  Mrs. Mittin was in raptures; and the following week was settled for the raffle.  Mrs. Arlbery, who had attended to this scene with much amusement, now said to  General Kinsale, who had taken a seat by her: 'Did I not tell you well,  General, that all men are at the disposition of women? If even the shrewd  monied man cannot resist, what heart shall we find impenetrable? The  connoisseur in human characters knows, that the pursuit of wealth is the  petrifaction of tenderness: yet yonder is my good brother-in-law, who thinks  cash and existence one, allured even to squander money, merely by the address  of that woman, in allowing that money should be the first study of life! Let  even Clarendel have a care of himself! or, when least he suspects any danger,  some fair dairy-maid will praise his horsemanship, or take a fancy to his  favourite spaniel, or any other favourite that happens to be the foible of the  day, and his invulnerability will be at her feet, and Lady Clarendel be brought  forward in a fortnight.'  Lord O'Lerney now entered the shop, accompanying a lady whose countenance and  appearance were singularly pleasing, and who, having made some purchase, was  quietly retiring, when the master of the shop inquired if she wished to look at  the ear-rings; adding, that though the number was full, he knew of one person,  who would give up her chance, in case it would oblige a customer.  She answered she had no present occasion for ear-rings, and would not therefore  take up either his time or her own unnecessarily; and then walked gently away,  still attended by Lord O'Lerney.  'Bless me,' cried Mrs. Arlbery, 'who is that? to hear a little plain common  sense is so rare, it strikes one more than wit.'  'It's Lady Isabella Irby, madam,' answered the master of the shop.  Here Lord O'Lerney, who had only handed her to her carriage, returned.  'My Lord,' cried Mrs. Arlbery, 'do you know what a curiosity you brought in  amongst us just now? A woman of rank who looks round upon other people just as  if she thought they were her fellow creatures?'  'Fie, fie!' answered Lord O'Lerney, laughing, 'why will you suppose that so  rare? If we have not as many women who are amiable with titles as without, it  is only because we have not the same number from which to select them. They are  spoilt or unspoilt, but in the same proportion as the rest of their sex. Their  fall, or their escape, is less local than you imagine; it does not depend upon  their titles, but upon their understandings.'  'Well, my lord, I believe you are right. I was adopting a narrow prejudice,  merely from indolence of thought.'  'But why, my lord,' cried Sir Sedley, 'does this paragon of a divinity deny her  example to the world? Is it in contempt of our incorrigibility? or in horror of  our contagion?'  'My dear Sir Sedley,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'don't flatter yourself with being so  dangerous. Her ladyship does not fly you from fear, take my word for it. There  is nothing in her air that looks as if she could only be good by being shut up.  I dare believe she could meet you every day, yet be mistress of herself!  Nevertheless, why, my lord, is she such a recluse? Why does one never see her  at the Rooms?'  'Never see her there, my dear madam! she is there almost every night; only  being unintruding, she is unnoticed.'  'The satire, then, my lord,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'falls upon the company. Why is  she not surrounded by volunteer admirers? Why, with a person and manner so  formed to charm, joined to such a character, and such rank, has she not her  train?'  'The reason, my dear madam, you could define with more sagacity than myself;  she must be sought! And the world is so lazy, that the most easy of access,  however valueless, is preferred to the most perfect, who must be pursued with  any trouble.'  Admirable Lord O'Lerney! thought Edgar, what a lesson is this to youthful  females against the glare of public homage, the false brilliancy of unfeminine  popularity!  This conversation, however, which alone of any he had heard at Tunbridge  promised him any pleasure, was interrupted by Mr. Dennel, who said the dinner  would be spoilt, if they did not all go home.  Camilla felt extremely vexed to quit the shop, without clearing up the history  of the dance; and Edgar, seeing the persevering Major at her side as she  departed, in urgency to put any species of period to his own sufferings,  followed the party, and precipitately began a discourse with Lord O'Lerney upon  making the tour of Europe. Camilla, for whom it was designed, intent upon  planning her own defence, heard nothing that was said, till Lord O'Lerney asked  him if his route would be through Switzerland, and he answered: 'My route is  not quite fixed, my lord.'  Startled, she now listened, and Mrs. Arlbery, whom she held by the arm, was  equally surprised, and looked to see how she bore this intimation.  'If you will walk with me to my lodgings,' replied Lord O'Lerney, 'I will shew  you my own route, which may perhaps save you some difficulties. Shall you set  out soon?'  'I fancy within a month,' answered Edgar; and, arm in arm, they walked away  together, as Camilla and her party quitted the Pantiles for Mount Pleasant.
