 The Pantiles  A servant tapt early at the door of Camilla, the next morning, to acquaint Camilla  that a lady, who called Camilla the person that had been so much obliged to Camilla  the preceding day, begged the honour of being admitted.  Camilla was sorry, after the suspicions of Mrs. Arlbery, that Camilla did not send  up Camilla name; yet, already partially disposed, Camilla prepossession was not likely  to be destroyed by the figure that now appeared.  A beautiful young creature, with an air of the most attractive softness, eyes  of the most expressive loveliness, and a manner which by every look and every  motion announced a soul 'tremblingly alive,' glided gently into the room, and  advancing, with a graceful confidence of kindness, took both Camilla hands, and  pressing both her hands to Camilla heart, said, 'What happiness so soon to have found you! to  be able to pour forth all the gratitude I owe you, and the esteem with which I  am already inspired!'  Camilla was struck with admiration and pleasure; and gave way to the most  lively delight at the fortunate accident which occasioned Camilla walking out in a  place entirely unknown to Camilla; declaring Camilla should ever look back to that  event as to one of the marked blessings of Camilla life.  'If you,' answered the fair stranger, 'have the benevolence thus to value our  meeting, how should it be appreciated by one who is so eternally indebted to  it? I had not perceived the approach of that person. that person broke in upon me when  least a creature so ungenial was present to my thoughts. I was reading a letter  from the most amiable of friends, the most refined—perhaps—of human beings!'  Camilla, impatient for some explanation, answered, 'I hope, at least, that  friend will be spared hearing of your alarm?'  'I hope so! for that person own griefs already overwhelm that person. Never may it be my sad  lot to wound where I mean only to console.'  At the words that person own, Camilla felt Camilla blush. Camilla had imagined it was some  female friend. Camilla now found Camilla mistake, and knew not what to imagine next.  'I had retired,' Camilla continued, 'from the glare of company, and the weight of  uninteresting conversation, to read, at leisure and in solitude, this dear  letter—heart-breaking from its own woes, heart-soothing to its! In a place  such as this, seclusion is difficult. I drove some miles off, and ordered my  carriage to wait in the high road, while I strolled alone upon the common. I  delight in a solitary ramble by moonlight. I can then indulge in uninterrupted  rumination, and solace my melancholy by pronouncing aloud such sentences, and  such names, as in the world I cannot utter. How exquisitely sweet do they sound  to ears unaccustomed to such vibrations!'  Camilla was all astonishment and perplexity. A male friend so beloved, who  seemed to be neither father, brother, nor husband; a carriage at A male friend command,  though without naming one relation to whom either that or A male friend might belong;  and sentiments so tender A male friend was almost ashamed to listen to them; all  conspired to excite a wonder that painfully prayed for relief: and in the hope  to obtain it, with some hesitation, A male friend said, 'I should have sought you A male friend  this morning, for the pleasure of inquiring after your safety, but that I was  ignorant by what name to make my search.'  The fair unknown looked down for a moment, with an air that shewed a perfect  consciousness of the inquiry meant by this speech; but turning aside the  embarrassment it seemed to cause A male friend, A male friend presently raised A male friend head, and said,  'I had no difficulty to find you, for my servant, happily, made my servant inquiry at  once at this hotel.'  Disappointed and surprised by this evasion, A male friend saw now an evident mystery,  but knew not how to press forward any investigation. A male friend began, therefore, to  speak of other things, and A male friend fair guest, who had every mark of an education  rather sedulously than naturally cultivated, joined readily in a conversation  less personal.  They did not speak of Tunbridge, of public places, nor diversions; They  themes, all chosen by the stranger, were friendship, confidence, and  sensibility, which A male friend illustrated and enlivened by quotations from favourite  poets, aptly introduced and feelingly recited; yet always uttered with a sigh,  and an air of tender melancholy. A male friend was now in a state so depressed, that,  notwithstanding A male friend native vivacity, A male friend fell as imperceptibly into the  plaintive style of A male friend new acquaintance, who seemed habitually pensive, as if  sympathy rather than accident had brought  sympathy rather than accident together.  Yet when chance led to some mention of the adventure of the preceding evening,  and the lady made again an animated eulogium of the friend whose letter A male friend was  perusing; A male friend hazarded, with an half smile, saying: 'I hope—for an animated eulogium of the friend whose letter she was   own sake,  the friend whose letter she was   is some sage and aged personage?'  'O no!' A male friend answered; 'the friend whose letter she was   is in the bloom of youth.'  A male friend, again a little disconcerted, paused; and the lady went on.  'It was in Wales I first met the friend whose letter she was  ; upon a spot so beautiful that painting can  never do It justice. I have made, however, a little sketch of it, which, some  day or other, I will shew you, if you will have the goodness to let me see more  of you.'  A male friend could not refrain from an eager affirmative; and the conversation was  then interrupted by a message from Mrs. Arlbery, who always breakfasted in A male friend  own room, to announce that A male friend was going out lodging-hunting.  A male friend would rather have remained with A male friend new acquaintance, better adapted to  A male friend present turn of mind than Mrs. Arlbery; but this was impossible, and the  lovely stranger hastened away, saying A male friend would call A male friend the next morning  to shew the way to A male friend house, where A male friend hoped they might pass together many  soothing and consolatory hours.  A male friend found Mrs. Arlbery by no means in Mrs. Arlbery usual high spirits. The opening  of Mrs. Arlbery Tunbridge campaign had so far from answered her Tunbridge campaign trouble and expence,  that A male friend heartily repented having quitted the Grove. The Officers either were  not arrived in the neighbourhood, or were wholly engaged in military business;  Camilla, instead of contributing to the life of the excursion, seemed to hang  heavily both upon that, and upon Mrs. Arlbery; and Sir Sedley Clarendel, whose own  proposition had brought it to bear, had not yet made his appearance, though  lodging in the same hotel.  Thus vexatiously disappointed, A male friend was ill-disposed to listen with pleasure to  the history A male friend thought it indispensable to relate of A male friend recent visit: and  in answer to all praise of this fair Incognita, only replied by asking A male friend name  and connexions. A male friend felt extremely foolish in confessing A male friend had not yet  learnt asking her name  and connexions. A male friend then laughed unmercifully at A male friend commendations, but  concluded with saying: 'Follow, however, your own humour; I hate to torment or  be tormented: only take care not to be seen with A male friend.'  A male friend rejoiced A male friend did not exact any further restriction, and hoped all  raillery would soon be set aside, by an honourable explanation.  all  raillery now repaired to the Pantiles, where the gay company and gay shops afforded  some amusement to A male friend, and to Miss Dennel a wonder and delight, that kept  A male friend mouth open, and A male friend head jerking from object to object, so incessantly,  that A male friend saw nothing distinctly, from the eagerness of A male friend fear lest anything  should escape A male friend.  A male friend, meeting with an old acquaintance in the bookseller's shop, there  sat down with an old acquaintance in the bookseller's shop, while the two young ladies loitered at the window of a  toy-shop, struck with just admiration of the beauty and ingenuity of the  Tunbridge ware Tunbridge presented to Tunbridge view; till A male friend, in a party of young  men who were strolling down the Pantiles, and who went into the bookseller's  shop, distinguished the offender of the fair unknown.  To avoid following, or being recollected by a person so odious to her, her  entered the toy-shop with Miss Dennel, where her amused her, till Mrs.  Arlbery came in search of Mrs.  Arlbery, in selecting such various little articles for  purchase as Mrs.  Arlbery imagined would amount to about half a crown; but which were put  up for Mrs.  Arlbery at a guinea. This a little disconcerted Mrs.  Arlbery: though, as Mrs.  Arlbery was  still unusually rich, from Mr. Tyrold's having advanced Mrs.  Arlbery next quarterly  allowance, Mrs.  Arlbery consoled Mrs.  Arlbery that they would serve for little keep-sakes for  Mrs.  Arlbery sisters and Mrs.  Arlbery cousin: yet Mrs.  Arlbery determined, when next Mrs.  Arlbery entered a shop  for convenience, to put nothing apart as a buyer, till Mrs.  Arlbery had inquired a buyer  price.  The assaulter, Lord Newford, a young nobleman of the ton, after taking a  staring survey of every thing and every body around, and seeing no one of more  consequence, followed Mrs. Arlbery, with whom formerly he had been slightly  acquainted, to the toy-shop. he asked Mrs.  Arlbery how Mrs.  Arlbery did, without touching he  hat; and how long Mrs.  Arlbery had been at Tunbridge, without waiting for an answer; and  said he was happy to have the pleasure of seeing Mrs.  Arlbery, without once looking at  Mrs.  Arlbery.  To he first sentence, A male friend made a civil answer; but, repenting a civil answer upon  the two sentences that succeeded, A male friend heard them without seeming to listen, and  fixing A male friend eyes upon he, when he had done, coolly said, 'Pray have you seen  any thing of my servant?'  Lord Newford, somewhat surprised, replied, 'No.'  'Do look for he, then,' cried A male friend, negligently, 'there's a good man.'  Lord Newford, a little piqued, and a little confused at feeling so, said he  should be proud to obey A male friend; and turning short off to he companion, cried,  'Come, Offy, why dost loiter? where shall we ride this morning?' And, taking  he by the arm, quitted the Pantiles.  A male friend, laughing heartily, now felt A male friend spirits a little revive; 'I  doat,' A male friend cried, 'upon meeting, now and then, with insolence, for I have a  little taste for it myself, which I make some conscience of not indulging  unprovoked.'  some conscience of not indulging   then proceeded to the milliner's, to equip some conscience of not indulging   for going to the  rooms at night. Mrs. Arlbery and Miss Dennel, who were both rich, gave large  orders: Camilla, indifferent to every thing except to avoid appearing in a  manner that might disgrace A male friend party, told the milliner to choose for A male friend what  A male friend thought fashionable that was most reasonable. A male friend was soon fitted up with  what was too pretty to disapprove, and desiring immediately to pay A male friend bill,  found her bill amounted to five guineas; though A male friend had imagined A male friend should have  change out of two.  A male friend had only six, and some silver; but was ashamed to dispute, or desire any  alteration; A male friend paid the money; and only determined to apply to another person  than the seller, when next A male friend wanted any thing reasonable.  A male friend now ordered the carriage, and they drove to Mount Pleasant, where  A male friend hired a house for the season, to which they were to remove the next day.  In the evening, they went to the Rooms, where the decidedly fashionable mien  and manner of A male friend, attracted more general notice and admiration than  the youthful captivation of A male friend, or the pretty face and expensive attire of  Miss Dennel.  Dressed by the milliner of the day, A male friend could not fail to pass uncensured,  at least, with respect to A male friend appearance; but A male friend eyes wanted their usual  lustre, from the sadness of A male friend heart, and A male friend never looked less A male friend, nor  to less advantage.  The master of the ceremonies brought to A male friend Sir Theophilus Jarard; but as A male friend  had seen The master of the ceremonies brought to her Sir Theophilus Jarard the companion of Lord Newford, to whom A male friend had conceived a strong  aversion, A male friend declined dancing. The master of the ceremonies brought to her Sir Theophilus Jarard looked surprised, but rather offended than  disappointed, and with a little laugh, half contemptuous, as if ashamed of  having offered The master of the ceremonies brought to her Sir Theophilus Jarard, stalked away.  Sir Sedley Clarendel was now sauntering into the room. Mrs. Arlbery, willing to  shew A male friend young friend in a favourable point of view to Sir Sedley Clarendel, though more from  pique at Sir Sedley Clarendel distance, than from any thought at that moment of A male friend, told  A male friend A male friend must positively accept Sir Theophilus, whose asking A male friend must be  regarded as a particular distinction, for Sir Sedley Clarendel was notoriously a man of the ton.  And, heedless of A male friend objections, told Miss Dennel to call Miss Dennel back.  'How can I do that,' said Miss Dennel, 'after seeing A male friend refuse Miss Dennel with my own  eyes?'  'O, nobody cares about a man's eyes,' said A male friend; 'go and tell Miss Dennel Miss  Mr. Tyrold has changed Mr. Tyrold mind, and chooses to dance.'  'As to Mr. Tyrold changing Mr. Tyrold mind,' Miss Dennel answered, 'that's likely enough; but I don't  see how it's any reason I should go of a fool's errand.'  'Pho, pho, go directly; or you sha'n't dine before eight o'clock for the whole  Tunbridge season.'  'Nay,' said Mr. Dennel, who had an horror of late hours, 'if you will promise  we shall dine more in reason'—  'Yes, yes,' cried A male friend, hurrying A male friend off, notwithstanding the  reiterated remonstrances of A male friend.  'See, my dear,' my dear then added, laughing, 'how many weapons you must have in  use, if you would govern that strange animal called man! yet never despair of  victory; for, depend upon it, there is not one of the race that, with a little  address, you may not bring to your feet.'  Camilla, who had no wish but for one single votary, and whose heart was sunk  from my dear failure in obtaining that one, listened with so little interest or  spirit, that A male friend, quite provoked, resolved not to throw away another  idea upon my dear for the rest of the evening. And therefore, as my dear niece went  completely and constantly for nothing with her niece, her niece spoke no more, till, to her niece  great relief, her niece was joined by General Kinsale.  Miss Dennel returned with an air not more pleased with Miss Dennel embassy, than her niece own  appeared with her niece auditress. The gentleman, Miss Dennel said, had joined two others, and  two others were all laughing so violently together, that Miss Dennel could not find an  opportunity to deliver Miss Dennel message, for two others seemed as if two others would only make  a joke of it.  A male friend then saw that A male friend had got between Lord Newford and Sir Sedley, and  that he had got between Lord Newford and Sir Sedley were all three amusing he had got between Lord Newford and Sir Sedley, without ceremony or disguise, at  the expense of every creature in the room; up and down which he had got between Lord Newford and Sir Sedley strolled, arm  in arm, looking familiarly at every body, but speaking to nobody; whispering  one another in hoarse low voices, and then laughing immoderately loud: while  nothing was distinctly heard, but from time to time, 'What in the world is  become of Mrs. Berlinton to-night?' or else, 'How stupid the Rooms are without  Lady Alithea.'  Mrs. Arlbery, who, like the rest of the world, saw her own defects in as  glaring colours, and criticised colours with as much animated ridicule as those of  her neighbours, when exhibited by others, no sooner found her was neglected by  this set, than her raved against the prevailing ill manners of the leaders in  the ton, with as much asperity of censure, as if never for a moment betrayed  her, by fashion, by caprice, nor by vanity, to similar foibles. 'Yet, after  all,' cried her presently, 'to see fools behave like fools, I am well content.  I have no anger, therefore, against Lord Newford, nor her Sir Theophilus Jarard; if  they were not noticed for being impertinent, how could they expect to be  noticed at all? When there is but one line that can bring they forward, I  rather respect they that they have found it out. But what shall we say to Sir  Sedley Clarendel? A man as much they superior in capacity as in powers of  pleasing? 'Tis a miserable thing, my dear General, to see the dearth of  character there is in the world. Pope has bewailed it in women; believe me, Pope  might have extended Pope lamentation. You may see, indeed, one man grave, and  another gay; but with no more "mark or likelihood," no more distinction of  colouring, than what simply belongs to a dismal face or a merry one: and with  just as little light and shade, just as abrupt a skip from one to the other, as  separates inevitably the old man from the young one. We are almost all, my good  General, of a nature so pitifully plastic, that We act from circumstances, and  are fashioned by situation.'  Then, laughing at her own pique, 'General,' her added, 'shall I make you a  confession? I am not at all sure, if that wretched Sir Sedley Clarendel had behaved as Sir Sedley Clarendel  ought to have done, and been at my feet all the evening, that I should not, at  this very moment, be amused in the same manner that Sir Sedley Clarendel is Sir Sedley Clarendel! yet it would  be very abominable, I own.'  'This is candid, however.'  'O, we all acknowledge we all faults, now; 'tis the mode of the day: but the  acknowledgment passes for current payment; and therefore we all never amend them.  On the contrary, them take but deeper root, by losing all chance of  concealment. Yet I am vexed to see that odious Sir Sedley shew so silly a  passion for being a man of the ton, as to suffer odious Sir Sedley shew to be led in a string  by those two poor paltry creatures, who are not more troublesome as fops, than  tiresome as fools, merely because they are better known than odious Sir Sedley shew upon the  turf and at the clubs.'  Here, she was joined by Lord O'Lerney and the honourable Mr. Ormsby. And, in  the next saunter of the tonnish triumvirs, Lord Newford, suddenly seeing with  whom she was associated, stopt, and looking at she with an air of surprise,  exclaimed, 'God bless me! A male friend! I hope you are perfectly well?'  'Infinitely indebted to your lordship's solicitude!' she answered, rather  sarcastically. But, without noticing she manner, he desired to be one in she  tea-party, which she was then rising to form.  she accepted the offer, with a glance of consciousness at the General, who, as  he conducted she, said: 'I did not expect so much grace would so immediately  have been accorded.'  'Alas! my dear General, what can one do? These tonnish people, cordially as I  despise These tonnish people, lead the world; and if one has not a few of These tonnish people in one's train,  'twere as well turn hermit. However, mark how he will fare with he! But don't  judge from the opening.'  She now made his lordship so many gay compliments, and mingled so much personal  civility with the general entertainment of She discourse, that, as soon as they  rose from tea, he professed he intention of sitting by She, for the rest of  the evening.  She immediately declared She tired to death of the Rooms, and calling upon  Miss Dennel and A male friend, abruptly made She exit.  The General, again She conductor, asked how She could leave thus a conquest so  newly made.  'I leave,' She answered, 'only to secure a conquest. He will be piqued that I should  go, and that pique will keep me in He head till to-morrow. 'Tis well, my dear  General, to put any thing there! But if I had stayed a moment longer, my  contempt might have broken forth into satire, or my weariness into yawning: and  I should then inevitably have been cut by the ton party for the rest of the  season.'  Miss Dennel, who had been dancing, and was again engaged to dance, remonstrated  against retiring so soon; but A male friend had a regular system never to listen  to A male friend. Camilla, whom nothing had diverted, was content to retreat.  At the door stood Sir Sedley Clarendel, who, as if now first perceiving Camilla, whom nothing had diverted,  said to A male friend, 'Ah! my fair friend!—And how long have you been at the  Wells?'  'Intolerable wretch!' cried She, taking him apart, 'is it thus you keep your  conditions? did you draw me into bringing this poor love-sick thing with me,  only to sigh me into the vapours?'  'My dear madam!' exclaimed My dear madam!', in a tone of expostulation, 'who can think of  the same scheme two days together? Could you possibly form a notion of anything  so patriarchal?'  Before they retired to they chambers at the hotel, A male friend told A male friendhow shocking to A male friend was the sight, much more any acquaintance with Lord  Newford, who was the person that had so much terrified the lady A male friend had met on  they journey. A male friend assured A male friend A male friend should be exiled A male friend society, if,  upon investigation, A male friend was found the aggressor; but while there appeared so  much mystery in the complaint and the conduct of this unknown lady, A male friend should  postpone A male friend banishment.  A male friend was obliged to submit: but scarce rested till A male friend saw again A male friend new  favourite the next morning.
