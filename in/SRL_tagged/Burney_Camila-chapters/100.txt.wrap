 Brides and no Brides  In the hall of the Cleves mansion the party from Southampton were received by  Sir Hugh, Mr. Tyrold, and Lavinia. The baronet greeted in particular the two  nieces he regarded as brides elect, with an elation that prevented him from  observing their sadness; while their confusion at his mistake he attributed to  the mere bashfulness of their situation. He enquired, nevertheless, with some  surprise, why the two bridegrooms did not attend them? which, he owned, he  thought rather odd; though he supposed it might be only the new way.  The changing colour and starting tears of the two sisters still escaped his  kindly occupied but undiscerning eyes: while Mr. Tyrold, having tenderly  embraced, avoided looking at them from the fear of adding to their blushes, and  sat quiet and grave, striving to alleviate his present new and deep sorrow, by  participating in the revived happiness of his brother. But Lavinia soon saw  their mutual distress, and with apprehensive affection watched an opportunity  to investigate its cause.  'But come,' cried Sir Hugh, 'I sha'n't wait for those gentlemen to shew you  what I've done for you, seeing they don't wait for me, by their following their  own way, which, however, I suppose they may be with their lawyers, none of  those gentleman having been here, which I think rather slow, considering the  rooms are almost ready.'  He would now have taken them round the house; but, nearly expiring with shame,  they entreated to be excused; and, insupportably oppressed by the cruel  discovery they had to divulge, stole apart to consult upon what measures they  should take. They then settled that Camilla should accompany Mr. Tyrold to  Etherington, but keep off all disclosure till the next morning, when Eugenia  would arrive, and unfold the sad tidings.  When they returned to the parlour, they found Sir Hugh, in the innocency of his  heart, had forced Indiana, Miss Margland, and even Dr. Orkborne, to view his  improvements for the expected nuptials, judging the disinterestedness of their  pleasure by his own; though to the two ladies, nothing could be less gratifying  than preparations for a scene in which they were to bear no part, and the  Doctor thought every evil genius at work to detain him from his study and his  manuscripts.  'But what's the oddest' cried the Baronet, 'of all, is nobody's coming for poor  Indiana; which I could never have expected, especially in the point of taking  off little Eugenia first, whom her own cousin did not think pretty enough;  which I can never think over and above good natured in him, being so difficult.  However, I hope we shall soon forget that, now for which reason, I forgive him.'  Indiana was so much piqued, she could scarce refrain from relating the portico  history at Lord Pervil's; but the Baronet, not remarking her discomposure,  turned to Camilla and Eugenia, smilingly exclaiming: 'Well, my dear girls, I  sha'n't mention what we have been looking at in your absence, because of your  blushes, which I hope you approve. But we shall soon, I hope, see it all  together, without any of your modesty's minding it. I shall have to pinch a  little for it the rest of the year, which, God knows, will be a pleasure to me,  for the sake of my two dear girls, as well as of Mr. Edgar; not to mention the  new young gentleman; who seems a pretty kind of person too, though he is not  one of our own relations.'  He was rather disappointed when he found Camilla was to go to Etherington, but  desired there might be a general meeting the next day, when he should also  invite Dr. Marchmont. 'For I think' said he, 'he's as little proud as the best  dunce amongst us; which makes me like him as well. And I can't say but I was as  much obliged to him that day about the mad bull, as if he had been one of my  nephews or nieces himself: which is what I sha'n't forget.'  In the way back to Etherington, Camilla could scarce utter a word; and Lavinia,  who had just gathered from her, in a whisper 'All is over with Edgar!' with  divided, but silent pity, looked from her father to her sister, thought of her  brother, and wept for all three. Mr. Tyrold alone was capable of any exertion.  Unwilling to give Camilla, whom he concluded impressed with the thousand  solicitudes of her impending change of situation, any abrupt account of her  brother's cruel conduct, he spoke with composure though not with cheerfulness,  and hoped, by a general gravity, to prepare, without alarming her, for the ill  news he must inevitably relate. But he soon, however, observed an excess of  sadness upon her countenance, far deeper than what he could attribute to the  thoughts he had first suggested, and wholly different from an agitation in  which though fear bears a part, hope preponderates.  It now struck him that probably Lionel had been at Southampton: for so wide was  every idea from supposing any mischief with Edgar, that, like Sir Hugh, upon  his non-appearance, he had concluded him engaged with his lawyer. But of  Melmond, less sure, he had been more open in enquiry, and with inexpressible  concern, for his beloved and unfortunate Eugenia, gathered that the affair was  ended: though her succeeding plan, by her own desire, Camilla left for her own  explanation.  When they arrived at Etherington, taking her into his study, 'Camilla,' he  said, 'tell me, I beg ... do you know anything of Lionel?'  An unrestrained burst of tears convinced him his conjecture was right, and he  soon obtained all the particulars of the meeting, except its levity and  flightiness. Where directly questioned, no sisterly tenderness could induce her  to filial prevarication; but she rejoiced to spare her brother all exposure  that mere silence could spare; and as Mr. Tyrold suspected not her former  knowledge of his extravagance and ill conduct, he neither asked, nor heard, any  thing beyond the last interview.  At the plan of going abroad, he sighed heavily, but would take no measures to  prevent it. Lionel, he saw was certain of being cast in any trial; and though  he would not stretch out his arm to avert the punishment he thought deserved,  he was not sorry to change the languid waste of imprisonment at home, for the  hardships with which he might live upon little abroad.  A calamity such as this seemed cause full sufficient for the distress of  Camilla; Mr. Tyrold sought no other; but though she wept, now, at liberty, his  very freedom from suspicion and enquiry increased her anguish. 'Your happy  fate,' cried he, 'is what most, at this moment supports me; and to that I shall  chiefly owe the support of your mother; whom a blow such as this will more  bitterly try than the loss of our whole income, or even than the life itself of  your brother. Her virtue is above misfortune, but her soul will shudder at  guilt.'  The horror of Camilla was nearly intolerable at this speech, and the dreadful  disappointment which she knew yet to be awaiting her loved parents. 'Take  comfort, my dearest girl,' said Mr. Tyrold, who saw her suffering, 'it is  yours, for all our sakes to be cheerful, for to you we shall owe the worthiest  of sons, at the piercing juncture when the weakest and most faulty fails us.'  'O my father!' she cried, 'speak not such words! Lionel himself ...' she was  going to say: has made you less unhappy than you will be made by me: but she  durst not finish her phrase; she turned away from him her streaming eyes, and  stopt.  'My dearest child,' he cried, 'let not your rising prospects be thus dampt by  this cruel event. The connection you have formed will be a consolation to us  all. It binds to us for life a character already so dear to us; it will afford  to our Lavinia, should we leave her single, a certain asylum; it will give to  our Eugenia a counsellor that may save her hereafter from fraud and ruin; it  may aid poor Lionel, when, some time hence, he returns to his country, to  return to the right path, whence so widely he has strayed; and it will heal  with lenient balm the wounded, bleeding bosom of a meritorious but deeply  afflicted mother! While to your father, my Camilla....'  These last words were not heard; such a mention of her mother had already  overpowered her, and unable to let him keep up his delusion, she supported her  shaking frame against his shoulder, and exclaimed in a tone of agony: 'O my  father! you harrow me to the soul!—Edgar has left me!—has left  England!—left us all!—--'  Shocked, yet nearly incredulous, he insisted upon looking at her: her  countenance impelled belief. The woe it expressed could be excited by nothing  less than the deprivation of every worldly expectation, and a single glance was  an answer to a thousand interrogatories.  Mr. Tyrold now sat down, with an air between calmness and despondence, saying,  'And how has this come to pass?'  Again she got behind him, and in a voice scarce audible, said, Eugenia would,  the next morning, explain all.  'Very well, I will wait;' he quietly, but with palpably stifled emotions,  answered: 'Go, my love, go to Lavinia; open to her your heart; you will find  consolation in her kindness. My own, I confess, is now weighed down with  sorrow! this last and unexpected stroke will demand some time, some solitude,  to be yielded to as it ought.' He then held out to her his hand, which she  could scarcely approach from trembling, and scarcely kiss for weeping, and  added: 'I know what you feel for me—and know, too, that my loss to yours is  nothing,—for yours is not to be estimated! you are young, however, and, with  yourself, it may pass away ... but your mother—my heart, Camilla, is rent for  your unfortunate mother!'  He then embraced her, called Lavinia, and retired for the night.  Terribly it passed with them all.  The next morning, before they assembled to breakfast, Eugenia was in the  chamber of Camilla.  She entered with a bright beam upon her countenance, which, in defiance of the  ravaging distemper that had altered her, gave it an expression almost  celestial. It was the pure emanation of virtue, of disinterested, of even  heroic virtue. 'Camilla!' she cried, 'all is settled with my uncle! Indiana ...  you will not wonder—consents; and already this morning I have written to Mr.  Mel....'  With all her exaltation, her voice faltered at the name, and, with a faint  smile, but deep blush, she called for the congratulations of her sister upon  her speedy success.  'Ah, far more than my congratulations, my esteem, my veneration is yours, dear  and generous Eugenia! true daughter of my mother! and proudest recompence of my  father!'  She was not sufficiently serene to give any particulars of the transaction; and  Mr. Tyrold soon sent for her to his room.  Camilla, trembling and hanging over her, said: 'You will do for me, I know  better than I could do for myself:—but spare poor Lionel—and be just to  Edgar!'—  Eugenia strictly obeyed: in sparing Lionel she spared also her father, whom his  highly unfeeling behaviour with regard to Sir Sedley would yet further have  incensed and grieved; and, in doing justice to Edgar, she flattered herself she  prevented an alienation from one yet destined to be nearly allied to him, since  time, she still hoped, would effect the reconciliation of Camilla with the  youth whom—next to Melmond—she thought the most amiable upon earth.  Mr. Tyrold, by this means, gathered no further intelligence than that they had  parted upon some mutual, though slight dissatisfaction. He hoped, therefore,  with Eugenia, they might soon meet again; and resolved, till he could better  judge what might prove the event, to keep this distress from Sir Hugh.  He then met Camilla with the most consolatory kindness; yet would not trust her  ardent mind with the hopes he cherished himself, dreading infinitely more to  give than to receive disappointment. He blamed her for admitting any doubts of  the true regard of Edgar, in whom promise was always short of performance, and  whom he conceived displeased by unjust suspicions, or offended by undue  expectations of professions, which the very sincerity of his rational and manly  character prevented him from making.  Camilla heard in silence suggestions she could not answer, without relating the  history of Sir Sedley: 'No, Lionel, no!' she said to herself, 'I will not now  betray you! I have lost all!—and now the loss to me is irreparable, shall I  blast you yet further to my poor father, whose deepest sigh is already for your  misconduct?'  The story of Eugenia herself he learnt with true admiration, and gave to her  magnanimity its dearest mede, in her mother's promised, and his own immediate  approbation.  But Sir Hugh, notwithstanding all Eugenia could urge in favour of Melmond, had  heard her account with grief and resentment. All, however, being actually ready  for the double wedding, he could not, he said, answer to his conscience doing  so much for the rest, and refusing the same for Indiana, whom he called upon to  accept or reject the preparations made for her cousin.  Indiana stood fluttering for a few minutes between the exultation of being the  first bride, and the mortification of marrying a man without fortune or title.  But the observation of Sir Hugh, upon the oddity of her marrying the last, she  was piqued with a most earnest ambition to reverse. Nor did Melmond himself go  for nothing in this affair, as all she had of heart he had been the first to  touch.  She retired for a short conference with Miss Margland, who was nearly in an  equal dilemma, from unwillingness to dispose of her beautiful pupil without a  title, and from eagerness to quit Cleves, which she thought a convent for  dullness, and a prison for confinement. Melmond had strongly in his favour the  received maxim amongst match-makers, that a young lady without fortune has a  less and less chance of getting off upon every public appearance, which they  call a public failure: their joint deliberations were, however, interrupted by  an abrupt intrusion of Molly Mill, who announced she had just heard that Miss  Dennel was going to be married.  This information ended the discussion. The disgrace of a bridal appearance  anticipated in the neighbourhood by such a chit, made Indiana hastily run down  stairs, and tell her uncle that the merit of Melmond determined her to refuse  every body for his sake.  A man and horse, therefore, at break of day the next morning, was sent off by  Eugenia to Southampton with these words:  To Frederic Melmond, Esq.;  You will be welcome, Sir, at Cleves, where you will forget, I hope, every  painful sensation, in the happiness which awaits you, and dismiss all  retrospection, to return with sincerity the serene friendship of  Eugenia Tyrold.  Mr. Tyrold now visited Cleves with only his younger daughter, and excused the  non-appearance there, for the present, of Camilla; acknowledging that some  peculiar incidents, which he could not yet explain, kept Mandlebert away, and  must postpone the celebration of the marriage.  The vexation this gave Sir Hugh, redoubled his anxiety to break to him the evil  by degrees, if to break it to him at all should become indispensable.
