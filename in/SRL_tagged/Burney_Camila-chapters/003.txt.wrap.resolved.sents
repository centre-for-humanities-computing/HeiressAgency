 Consequences  Every precaution being taken with regard to Lavinia and Lavinia clothes, for  warding off infection to Eugenia, if as yet Lavinia had escaped yet; Mrs. Tyrold  fixed a day for fetching Mrs. Tyrold   little daughter from Cleves.
Sir Hugh, at the  earnest entreaty of Camilla, invited the young party to come again early that  morning, that some amends might be made the young party for the young party recent disappointment of  the ball and supper, by a holiday, and a little sport, previous to the arrival  of Mrs. Tyrold  ; to whom he voluntarily pledged he word, that Eugenia should  not again be taken abroad, nor suffered to appear before any strangers.
Various gambols were now again enacted by the once more happy group; but all  was conducted with as much security as gaiety, till Lionel proposed the  amusement of riding upon a plank in the park.
A plank was immediately procured by the gardener, and placed upon the trunk of  an old oak, where A plank parted into two thick branches.
The boys and the three eldest girls balanced one another in turn, with great  delight and dexterity; but Sir Hugh feared committing the little Eugenia, for  whom Sir Hugh was grown very anxious, amongst The boys and the three eldest girls, till the repinings of the child  demolished Sir Hugh prudence.
The difficulty how to indulge Eugenia with safety was,  nevertheless, considerable: and, after various experiments, Sir Hugh resolved to  trust Eugenia to nobody but Sir Hugh; and, placing Eugenia upon Sir Hugh lap, occupied one  end of A plank, and desired that as many of the rest as were necessary to  make the weight equal, would seat themselves upon the other.
This diversion was short, but This diversion consequences were long.
Edgar Mandlebert, who  superintended the balance, poised it with great exactness; yet no sooner was  Sir Hugh elevated, than, becoming exceedingly giddy, Sir Hugh involuntarily loosened  Sir Hugh hold of Eugenia, who fell from Sir Hugh arms to the ground.
In the agitation of Sir Hugh fright, Sir Hugh stooped forward to save Eugenia, but lost Sir Hugh  equilibrium; and, instead of rescuing, followed Eugenia.
The greatest confusion ensued; Edgar, with admirable adroitness, preserved the  elder girls from suffering by the accident; and Lionel took care of Lionel by  leaping instantly from A plank: Sir Hugh, extremely bruised, could not get up  without pain; but all concern and attention soon centred in the little Eugenia,  whose incessant cries raised apprehensions of some more than common mischief.
She was carried to the house in the arms of Edgar, and delivered to the  governess.
She screamed the whole time She was undressing; and Edgar, convinced  She had received some injury, galloped off, unbid, for a surgeon: but what was  the horror of Sir Hugh, upon hearing Sir Hugh pronounce, that She left shoulder was  put out, and that one of She knees was dislocated!
In an agony of remorse, Lionel shut Lionel up in Lionel room, without power to issue  a command, or listen to a question: nor could Lionel be prevailed upon to open Lionel  door, till the arrival of Mrs. Tyrold.
Hastily then rushing out, Lionel hurried to meet She; and, snatching both She  hands, and pressing both her   between Lionel own, Lionel burst into a passionate flood of  tears, and sobbed out: 'Hate me, my dear sister, for you can't help it!
for I  am sorry to tell it you, but I believe I have been the death of poor Eugenia,  that never hurt a fly in my dear sister life!'
Pale, and struck with dread, yet always possessing my dear sister presence of mind, Mrs. Tyrold disengaged Mrs. Tyrold, and demanded where Mrs. Tyrold might find Mrs. Tyrold?
Sir Hugh  could make no rational answer; but Edgar, who had run down stairs, purposing to  communicate the tidings more gently, briefly stated the misfortune, and  conducted Mrs. Tyrold to the poor little sufferer.
Mrs. Tyrold, though nearly overpowered by a sight so affecting, still preserved  Mrs. Tyrold faculties for better uses than lamentation.
Mrs. Tyrold held the child in Mrs. Tyrold arms  while the necessary operations were performing by the surgeon; Mrs. Tyrold put Mrs. Tyrold to  bed, and watched by Mrs. Tyrold side the whole night; during which, in defiance of all  precautions, a high fever came on, and Mrs. Tyrold grew worse every moment.
The next morning, while still in this alarming state, the unfortunate little  innocent exhibited undoubted symptoms of the small pox.
Mrs. Tyrold now also established Mrs. Tyrold at Cleves, to share the parental task  of nursing the afflicted child, whose room Mrs. Tyrold never left, except to give  consolation to Mrs. Tyrold unhappy brother, who lived wholly in Mrs. Tyrold own apartment,  refusing the sight even of Camilla, and calling Mrs. Tyrold a monster too wicked to  look at any thing that was good; though the affectionate little girl, pining at  the exclusion, continually presented Mrs. Tyrold at Mrs. Tyrold door.
The disease bore every prognostic of fatal consequences, and the fond parents  soon lost all hope, though the fond parents   redoubled every attention.
Sir Hugh then gave Sir Hugh up wholly to despair: Sir Hugh darkened Sir Hugh room, refused  all food but bread and water, permitted no one to approach Sir Hugh, and reviled  Sir Hugh invariably with the contrition of a wilful murderer.
In this state of self-punishment Sir Hugh persevered, till the distemper unexpectedly  took a sudden and happy turn, and the surgeon made known, that Sir Hugh patient  might possibly recover.
The joy of Sir Hugh was now as frantic as Sir Hugh grief had been the moment before:  Sir Hugh hastened to Sir Hugh drawing-room, commanded that the whole house should be  illuminated; promised a year's wages to all Sir Hugh servants; bid Sir Hugh house-keeper  distribute beef and broth throughout the village; and sent directions that the  bells of the three nearest parish churches should be rung for a day and a  night.
But when Mr. Tyrold, to avert the horror of any wholly unprepared  disappointment, represented the still precarious state of Eugenia, and the many  changes yet to be feared; Mr. Tyrold desperately reversed all Mr. Tyrold orders, returned  sadly to Mr. Tyrold , and protested Mr. Tyrold would never more rejoice, till Mrs.  Tyrold herself should come to Mr. Tyrold with good news.
This anxiously waited æra at length arrived; Eugenia, though seamed and even  scarred by the horrible disorder, was declared out of danger; and Mrs. Tyrold,  burying Eugenia anguish at the alteration, in Eugenia joy for the safety of Eugenia child,  with an heart overflowing from pious gratitude, became the messenger of peace;  and, holding out Eugenia hand to Sir Hugh, assured Sir Hugh the little Eugenia would  soon be well.
Sir Hugh, in an ecstasy which no power could check, forgot every pain and  infirmity to hurry up to the apartment of the little girl, that Sir Hugh might kneel,  Sir Hugh said, at the little girl feet, and there give thanks for the little girl recovery: but the moment Sir Hugh  entered the room, and saw the dreadful havoc grim disease had made on the little girl face;  not a trace of the little girl beauty left, no resemblance by which Sir Hugh could have known  the little girl; Sir Hugh shrunk back, wrung Sir Hugh hands, called Sir Hugh the most sinful of all  created beings, and in the deepest despondence, sunk into a chair and wept  aloud.
Eugenia soon began to cry also, though unconscious for what cause; and Mrs.  Tyrold remonstrated to Sir Hugh upon the uselessness of such transports, calmly  beseeching Sir Hugh to retire and compose Sir Hugh.
'Yes, sister,' Sir Hugh answered, 'yes, I'll go away, for I am sure, I do not want to  look at sister again; but to think of its being all my doing!—O brother!
O  sister!
why don't you both kill me in return?
And what amends can I make sister?
what amends, except a poor little trifle of money?—And as to that, sister shall  have it, God knows, every penny I am worth, the moment I am gone; ay, that sister  shall, to a single shilling, if I die tomorrow!'
Starting up with revived courage from this idea, Sir Hugh ventured again to turn Sir Hugh  head towards Eugenia, exclaiming: 'O, if sister does but get well!
does but ease  my poor conscience by making me out not to be a murderer, a guinea for every  pit in that poor face will I settle on sister out of hand; yes, before I so much  as breathe again, for fear of dying in the mean time!'
Mrs. Tyrold scarce noticed this declaration; but Mrs. Tyrold scarce brother endeavoured to  dissuade his brother from so sudden and partial a measure: his brother would not, however,  listen; his brother made what speed his brother could down stairs, called hastily for his brother hat and  stick, commanded all his servants his brother to attend his brother, and muttering frequent  ejaculations to his brother, that his brother would not trust to changing his brother mind, his brother  proceeded to the family chapel, and approaching with eager steps to the altar,  knelt down, and bidding every one hear and witness what his brother said, made a solemn  vow, 'That if his brother might be cleared of the crime of murder, by the recovery of  Eugenia, his brother would atone what his brother could for the ill his brother had done Eugenia, by  bequeathing to Eugenia every thing his brother possessed in the world, in estate, cash, and  property, without the deduction of a sixpence.'
his brother told all present to remember and witness this, in case of an apoplexy before  his brother new will could be written down.
Returning then to the house, lightened, his brother said, from a load of self-reproach,  which had rendered the last fortnight insupportable to his brother, his brother sent for the  attorney of a neighbouring town, and went upstairs, with a firmer mind, to wait  his brother arrival in the sick room.
'O my dear uncle,' cried his brother long banished Camilla, who hearing his brother upon the  stairs, skipt lightly after his brother, 'how glad I am to see you again!
I almost  thought I should see you no more!'
Here ended at once the just acquired tranquility of Sir Hugh; all Sir Hugh  satisfaction forsook Sir Hugh at the appearance of Sir Hugh little darling; Sir Hugh considered  her as an innocent creature whom Sir Hugh was preparing to injure; Sir Hugh could not bear  to look at her; Sir Hugh heart smote Sir Hugh in her favour; Sir Hugh eyes filled with tears;  Sir Hugh was unable to go on, and with slow and trembling steps, Sir Hugh moved again  towards Sir Hugh own room.
''O my dear uncle cried Camilla, holding by 'O my dear uncle coat, and hanging upon 'O my dear uncle  arm, 'won't you speak to 'O my dear uncle?'
'Yes, my dear, to be sure I will,' 'O my dear uncle answered, endeavouring to hide 'O my dear uncle  emotion, 'only not now; so don't follow her, for I'm going to be  remarkably busy!'
'O uncle!'
her cried, plaintively, 'and I have not seen you so long!
And I have  wished so to see you!
and I have been so unhappy about Eugenia!
and you have  always locked your door; and I would not rap hard at your door, for fear you should be  asleep: But why would you not see me, uncle?
and why will you send me away?'
'her,' uncle replied, with increased agitation, 'I have used you very  ill; I have been your worst enemy, which is the very reason I don't care to see  you; so go away, I beg, for I am bad enough without all this.
But I give you my  thanks for all your little playful gambols, having nothing better now to offer  you; which is but a poor return from an uncle to a niece!'
a poor return from an uncle to a niece then shut a poor return from an uncle to a niece into a poor return from an uncle to a niece , leaving her drowned in tears at the  outside of your door.
Wretched in reflecting upon the shock and disappointment which the new  disposition of a poor return from an uncle to a niece affairs must occasion his affairs, a poor return from an uncle to a niece had not fortitude to inform  his affairs of a poor return from an uncle to a niece intention.
a poor return from an uncle to a niece desired to speak with Edgar Mandlebert, who, with all  the Tyrold family, resided, for the present, at Cleves, and abruptly related to  a poor return from an uncle to a niece the new destination a poor return from an uncle to a niece had just vowed of a poor return from an uncle to a niece wealth; beseeching that a poor return from an uncle to a niece  would break it in the softest manner to a poor return from an uncle to a niece poor little favourite, assuring his affairs  his affairs would be always the first in a poor return from an uncle to a niece love, though a point of mere conscience  had forced a poor return from an uncle to a niece to make choice of another heiress.
Edgar, whose zeal to serve and oblige had never been put to so severe a test,  hesitated how to obey this injunction; yet a poor return from an uncle to a niece would not refuse this injunction, as a poor return from an uncle to a niece found  that all the servants of the house were enabled, if all the servants of the house pleased, to anticipate  more incautiously the ill news.
a poor return from an uncle to a niece followed his affairs, therefore, into the garden,  whither his affairs had wandered to weep unobserved; but a poor return from an uncle to a niece stopt short at sight of his affairs  distress, conceiving a poor return from an uncle to a niece errand to be already known to his affairs, and determined to  consult with Indiana, to whom a poor return from an uncle to a niece communicated a poor return from an uncle to a niece terrible embassy, entreating  his affairs to devise some consolation for his affairs poor cousin.
Indiana felt too much chagrined at his affairs own part in this transaction, to give  his affairs attention to her; his affairs murmured without scruple at the deprivation of  what his affairs had once expected for his affairs, and at another time for his affairs brother;  and expressed much resentment at the behaviour of his affairs uncle, mingled with  something very near repining, not merely at a poor return from an uncle to a niece late preference of her, but  even at the recovery of the little Eugenia.
Edgar heard his affairs with surprise, and  wondered to find how much less his affairs attracted Edgar from the failure of his affairs  good nature.
Edgar now pursued the weeping Camilla, who, dispersing his affairs tears at Edgar approach,  pretended to be picking some lavender, and keeping his affairs eyes steadfastly upon  the bush, asked Edgar if Edgar would have any?
Edgar took a sprig, but spoke to his affairs in  a voice of such involuntary compassion, that his affairs soon lost his affairs self-command,  and the big drops again rolled fast down his affairs cheeks.
Extremely concerned, Edgar  strove gently to sooth his affairs; but the expressions of regret at his affairs uncle's  avoidance, which then escaped his affairs, soon convinced Edgar Edgar own task was still to  be performed.
With anxious fear of the consequences of a blow so unlooked for,  Edgar executed it with all the speed, yet all the consideration in Edgar power.
her, the moment her understood Edgar, passionately clasped her , and  exclaimed: 'O if that is all!
If her uncle's   indeed loves me as well as before all  this; I am sure I can never, never be so wicked, as to envy poor little  Eugenia, who has suffered so much, and almost been dying, because her uncle's   will be  richer than I shall be!'
Edgar, delighted and relieved, thought her uncle's   was grown a thousand times more  beautiful than Indiana; and eagerly taking her uncle's   hand, ran with her uncle's   to the  apartment of the poor disconsolate Sir Hugh; where her uncle's   own eyes soon overflowed  from tenderness and admiration, at the uncommon scene her uncle's   witnessed, of the  generous affection with which her consoled the fond distress of her uncle,  though springing from her uncle's   own disappointment and loss.
They stayed till the arrival of the attorney, who took the directions of Sir  Hugh, and drew up, for Sir   immediate satisfaction, a short deed, making over,  according to Sir   vow, all Sir   should die possessed of, without any let or  qualification whatsoever, to Sir   niece Eugenia.
This was properly signed and  sealed, and Sir Hugh hastened up stairs with a copy of This to Mrs.  Tyrold.
All remonstrance was ineffectual; Mrs.  Tyrold conscience, Mrs.  Tyrold protested, could no other  way be appeased; Mrs.  Tyrold noble little her had forgiven his noble little Camilla his noble little Camilla ill usage, and  Mrs.  Tyrold could now bear to look at the change for the worse in Eugenia, without  finding Mrs.  Tyrold heart-strings ready to burst at the sight.
'You,' Mrs.  Tyrold cried,  'brother, who do not know what it is I have suffered through my conscience,  can't tell what it is to get a little ease; for if his noble little Camilla had died, you might all  have had the comfort to say 'twas I murdered his noble little Camilla, which would have given you  the satisfaction of having had no hand in it.
But then, what would have become  of poor me, having it all upon my own head?
However, now thank Heaven, I have  no need to care about the matter; for as to the mere loss of beauty, pretty as  it is to look at, I hope it is no such great injury, as his noble little Camilla'll have a splendid  fortune, which is certainly a better thing, in point of lasting.
For as to  beauty, Lord help she'll have a splendid  fortune, which is certainly a better thing, in point of lasting!
what is it?
except just to the eye.'
Lord then walked up to the child, intending to kiss the child, but stopt and sighed  involuntarily as Lord looked at the child, saying: 'After all, the child's not like the same  thing!
no more than I am myself.
I shall never think I know the child again, never as  long as I live!
I can't so much as believe the child to be the same, though I am sure  of never as   being true.
However, it shall make no change in my love for the child, poor  little dear, for it's all my own doing; though innocently enough, as to any  meaning, God knows!'
It was still some time before the little girl recovered, and then a new  misfortune became daily more palpable, from some latent and incurable mischief,  owing to the little girl fall, which made the little girl grow up with one leg shorter than the other,  and the little girl whole figure diminutive and deformed: These additional evils reconciled  the little girl parents to the partial will of the little girl uncle, which they now, indeed, thought  less wanting in equity, since no other reparation could be offered to the  innocent sufferer for ills so insurmountable.
