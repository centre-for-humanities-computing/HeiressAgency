 A Proposal of Marriage  The increasing depression of Camilla, and the melancholy of her sympathising  sisters, though still attributed to the adverse wind by the compass-watching  baronet, escaped not the notice of Mr. Tyrold; who, alarmed for the peace of  his daughter, determined to watch for the first quiet opportunity of  investigating her actual situation.  Lionel, after breakfast, the next morning, was obliged to relinquish waiting  for Clermont, and to set off for Oxford. He contrived to whisper to Camilla,  that he hoped she would be a good girl at last, and not play the fool; but,  finding she only sighed, he laughed at her calamitious state, in becoming  mistress of fifteen thousand per annum, only by the small trouble of running  over a short ceremony; and, assuring her he would assist her off with part of  the charge, if it were too heavy for her, bid her inform him in time of the  propitious day.  Camilla, shortly after, saw from her window, galloping full speed across the  park to the house, Major Cerwood. She suspected her tormenting brother to have  been again at work; nor was she mistaken. He had met with the Major at the  hotel at Tunbridge, while his spirits, always violent, were in a state of  almost intoxication of delight, at the first idea of such an accession to his  powers of amusement, as a new brother rolling in immense wealth, which he  already considered as nearly at his own disposal. High wrought, therefore, for  what he deemed good sport, he confirmed what he had asserted at the ball at  Northwick, of the expectations of Camilla from Sir Hugh, by relating the public  fact, of her having been announced, to the family and neighbourhood, for his  uncle's heiress, at ten years of age; and only sinking, in his account, the  revocation made so soon after in favour of Eugenia. To this, he added his  advice, that no time was to be lost, as numberless new suitors were likely to  pursue her from Tunbridge.  The Major, upon alighting, inquired for Sir Hugh, deeming Mr. Tyrold of little  consequence, since it was not from him Camilla was to inherit her fortune.  The baronet, as usual, was watching the winds and the clouds; but, concluding  whoever came would bring some news from Clermont, received the Major with the  utmost cordiality, saying: 'I see, sir, you are a stranger; by which I suppose  you to be just come from abroad; where, I hope, you left all well?'  'I am just come, sir,' answered the Major, 'from Tunbridge, where I had the  honour, through my acquaintance with Mrs. Arlbery, of meeting daily with your  charming niece; an honour, sir, which must cause all the future happiness or  misery of my life.'  He then made a declaration, in form, of the most ardent passion for Camilla;  mentioned his family, which was an honourable one; talked of his expectations  with confidence, though vaguely; and desired to leave the disposition of the  settlement wholly to the baronet; who, he hoped, would not refuse to see his  elder brother, a gentleman of fortune in Lincolnshire, who would have the  honour to wait upon him, at any time he would be so good as to appoint, upon  this momentous affair.  Sir Hugh heard this harangue with consternation. The Major was in the prime of  life, his person was good, his speech was florid, his air was assured, and his  regimentals were gay. Not a doubt of his success occurred to the baronet; who  saw, in one blow, the darling scheme of his old age demolished, in the  deprivation of Camilla.  The Major impatiently waited for an answer; but Sir Hugh was too much  disordered to frame one; he walked up and down the room, muttering in a  desponding manner, to himself, 'Lord, help us! what a set of poor weak mortals  we are, we poor men! The best schemes and plans in the world always coming to  nothing before we can bring them about! I'll never form another while I live,  for the sake of this one warning. Nobody knows, next, but what Clermont will be  carrying off Eugenia to see foreign parts! and then comes some other of these  red-coats to take away Indiana; and, after doing all for the best so long, I  may be left all alone, except just for Mrs. Margland and the Doctor! that I  don't take much pleasure in, Lord help me! except as a Christian, which I hope  is no sin.'  At length, endeavouring to compose himself, he sat down, and said, 'So you are  come, sir, to take away from me my own particular little niece? which is a hard  thing upon an uncle, intending her to live with him. However, I don't mean to  find fault; but I can tell you this one thing, sir, which I beg you to  remember; which is, if you don't make her happy, you'll break my heart! For  she's what I love the best in the world, little as I've made it appear, by not  leaving her a shilling. For which sake, however, I can't but respect you the  more for coming after her, instead of Eugenia.'  'Sir?' cried the Major, amazed.  'The other two chaps,' continued he, 'that came about us not long ago, wanted  to make their court to Eugenia and Indiana; as well as another that came to the  house when I was ill, in the same coat as yourself, by what I can gather from  the description; but never a one has come to Camilla yet, except yourself,  because my brother can spare her but a trifle, having another young girl to  provide for, besides Lionel; which is the most expensive of them all, poor boy!  never having enough, by the reason Oxford is so dear, as I suppose.'  The Major now wore an air of surprise and uneasiness that Sir Hugh began to  observe, but attributed to his unpleasant reception of his proposals. He begged  his pardon, therefore, and again assured him of his respect for a choice so  little mercenary, which he looked upon as a mark of a good heart.  The Major, completely staggered, and suspecting the information of Lionel to be  ill grounded, if not purposely deluding, entreated his permission to wait upon  him again; and offered for the present to take leave.  Sir Hugh, in a melancholy voice, said, he would first summon his niece, as he  could not answer it to his conscience preventing the meeting, unless she gave  him leave.  He then rang the bell, and told Jacob to call Camilla.  Major Cerwood was excessively distressed. To retreat seemed impossible; yet to  connect himself without fortune, when he thought he was addressing a rich  heiress, was a turn of fate he scarcely knew how either to support or to parry.  All that, in this haste, he could resolve, was, to let the matter pass for the  moment, and then insist upon satisfaction from Lionel, either in clearing up  the mistake, or taking upon himself its blame.  When Camilla appeared, the disturbance of Sir Hugh still augmented; and he  could hardly articulate, 'My dear, in the case you are willing to leave your  family, here's a gentleman come to make his addresses to you; which I think it  right you should know, though how I shall struggle through it, if I lose you,  is more than my poor weak head can tell; for what shall I do without my dear  little girl, that I thought to make the best comfort of my old age? which,  however, I beg you not to think of, in case this young Captain's more  agreeable.'  'Ah! my dear uncle!' cried she, 'your Camilla can never return half the comfort  she receives from you! keep me with you still, and ever! I am much obliged to  Major Cerwood. I beg him to accept my sincerest thanks; but to pardon me, when  I assure him, they are all I have to offer him.'  Repulse was not new to the Major; who, in various country towns, had sought to  retrieve his affairs by some prudent connection; his pride, however, had never  so little suffered as on the present occasion, for his apprehension of error or  imposition had removed from him all thought of even the possibility of a  refusal; which, now, therefore, unexpectedly and joyfully obviated his  embarrassment, and enabled him to quit the field by an honourable retreat. He  bowed profoundly, called himself, without knowing what he said, the most  unhappy of men; and, without risking one solicitation, or a moment for  repentance, hastily took leave, with intention, immediately, to demand an  explanation of Lionel.  But he had not escaped a mile from the house, ere he gave up that design, from  anticipating the ridicule that might follow it. To require satisfaction for a  young lady's want of fortune, however reasonable, would always be derided as  ludicrous. He resolved, therefore, quietly to put up with the rejection; and to  gather his next documents concerning the portion of a fair damsel, from  authority better to be relied upon than that of a brother.  Sir Hugh, for some time, discovered not that he had retired. Enchanted by so  unexpected a dismission, his favourite scheme of life seemed accorded to him,  and he pressed Camilla to his bosom, in a transport of joy. 'We shall live  together, now, I hope,' he cried, 'without any of these young chaps coming in  again to part us. Not that I would object to your marrying, my dear girl, if it  was with a relation, like Eugenia, or, with a neighbour, like Indiana, if it  had not been for its going off; but to see you taken away from me by a mere  stranger, coming from distant parts, and knowing nothing of any of us, is a  thing that makes my heart ache but to think of; so I hope it will happen no  more; for these trials do no good to my recovery.'  Turning round, then, with a view to say something consolatory to the Major, he  was seriously concerned to find him departed. 'I can't say,' he cried, 'I had  any intention to send him off so short, his meaning not being bad, considering  him in the light of a person in love; which is a time when a man has not much  thought, except for himself, by what I can gather.'  He then proposed a walk, to watch if Clermont were coming. The wind, he  acknowledged, was indeed contrary; but, he did not doubt, upon such a  particular occasion, his good lad would not mind such difficulties.
