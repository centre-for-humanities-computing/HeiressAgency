 A Dodging  Camilla waited in the apartment of Mr. Tyrold till Mr. Tyrold came up stairs, and then  begged Mr. Tyrold leave to spend a few days at the Grove; hinting, when Mr. Tyrold hesitated,  though with a confusion that was hardly short of torture, at what had passed  amongst the servants.
Mr. Tyrold heard Camilla with the tenderest pity, and the kindest praise of Camilla sincerity;  and, deeply as Mr. Tyrold was shocked to find Camilla thus generally betrayed, Mr. Tyrold was too  compassionate to point out, at so suffering a moment, the indiscretions from  which such observations must have originated.
Yet Mr. Tyrold saw consequences the most  unpleasant in this rumour of Camilla attachment; and though Mr. Tyrold still privately  hoped that the behaviour of Mandlebert was the effect of some transient  embarrassment, Mr. Tyrold wished Camilla removed from all intercourse with Mr. Tyrold that was not  sought by Mr. Tyrold, while the incertitude of Mr. Tyrold intentions militated against  Camilla struggles for indifference.
The result, therefore, of a short deliberation  was to accede to Camilla request.
Camilla then wrote Camilla proposition to Mrs. Arlbery, which Mr. Tyrold sent  immediately by a stable-boy of the baronet's.
The answer was most obliging; Camilla said Camilla would Camilla fetch Camilla the  next morning, and keep Camilla till one of them should be tired.
The relief which this, at first, brought to Camilla, in the week's exertions it  would spare, was soon succeeded by the most acute uneasiness for the critical  situation of Eugenia, and the undoubted disapprobation of Edgar.
To quit Camilla  sister at a period when Camilla might serve Camilla; ... to forsake Cleves at the  moment Edgar was restored to it, seemed selfish even to Camilla, and to Edgar  must appear unpardonable.
'Alas!'
Camilla cried, 'how for ever I repent my hasty  actions!
Why have I not better struggled against my unfortunate feelings?'
Camilla now almost hated Camilla whole scheme, regretted her whole scheme success, wished Camilla  suffering every uneasiness Miss Margland could inflict, and all the shame of  being watched and pitied by every servant in the house, in preference to  deserting Eugenia, and making Mandlebert deem Camilla unworthy.
But self-upbraiding  was all that followed Camilla contrition: Mrs. Arlbery was to fetch Mrs. Arlbery by  appointment; and it was now too late to trifle with the conceding goodness of  Mrs. Arlbery father.
Mrs. Arlbery did not dare excuse Mrs. Arlbery from appearing at breakfast the next morning,  lest Mr. Tyrold should think Mrs. Arlbery utterly incorrigible to Mr. Tyrold exhortations.
Edgar earnestly inquired after Mrs. Arlbery health as Mrs. Arlbery entered the room; Mrs. Arlbery slightly  answered Mrs. Arlbery was better; and began eating, with an apparent eagerness of  appetite: while he, who had expected some kind words upon his own accident,  surprised and disappointed, could swallow nothing.
Mr. Tyrold, seeing and pitying what passed in Mrs. Arlbery mind, gave Mrs. Arlbery a commission,  that enabled Mrs. Arlbery, soon, to leave the room without affectation; and, happy to  escape, Mrs. Arlbery determined to go down stairs no more till Mrs. Arlbery arrived.
Mrs. Arlbery  wished to have conversed first upon the affairs of Eugenia with Edgar: but to  name to Edgar whither Mrs. Arlbery was Mrs. Arlbery going, when Mrs. Arlbery could not possibly name  why; to give to Edgar a surprise that must recoil upon Mrs. Arlbery in disapprobation,  was more than Mrs. Arlbery could endure.
Mrs. Arlbery had invested Edgar with full powers to  counsel and to censure Mrs. Arlbery; Edgar would naturally use  counsel to dissuade Mrs. Arlbery from a  visit so ill-timed; and what could Mrs. Arlbery urge in opposition to Edgar arguments that  would not seem trifling or wilful?
The present moment was all that occupied, the present evil all that ever  alarmed the breast of Camilla: to avoid Edgar, therefore, now, was the whole of  Mrs. Arlbery desire, unmolested with one anxiety how Mrs. Arlbery might better meet Edgar hereafter.
Mrs. Arlbery watched at Mrs. Arlbery window till Mrs. Arlbery saw the groom of Mrs. Arlbery gallop into  the Park.
Mrs. Arlbery hastened then to take leave of Sir Hugh, whom Mr. Tyrold had  prepared for Mrs. Arlbery departure; but, at the door of Mr. Tyrold apartment, Mrs. Arlbery encountered  Edgar.
'You are going out?'
cried Mr. Tyrold, perceiving an alteration in Mrs. Arlbery dress.
'I am ... just going to ... to speak to my uncle,' cried Mrs. Arlbery, stammering and  entering the room at the same moment.
Sir Hugh kindly wished Mrs. Arlbery much amusement, and hoped Mrs. Arlbery would make Sir Hugh long  amends when Sir Hugh was better.
Mrs. Arlbery took leave; but again, on the landing-place, met  Edgar, who, anxious and perlexed, watched to speak to Mrs. Arlbery before Mrs. Arlbery descended  the stairs.
Eagerly advancing, 'Do you walk?'
Sir Hugh cried; 'may I ask?
or ... am I  indiscreet?'
Mrs. Arlbery answered Mrs. Arlbery had something to say to Eugenia, but should be back in an  instant.
Mrs. Arlbery then flew to the chamber of Mrs. Arlbery sister, and conjured Mrs. Arlbery to  consult Edgar in whatever should occur during Mrs. Arlbery absence.
Eugenia solemnly  consented.
Jacob presently tapped at the door of his apartment, to announce that Mrs. Arlbery was waiting  below in Mrs. Arlbery carriage.
How to pass or escape Edgar became now Mrs. Arlbery greatest difficulty; Mrs. Arlbery could  suggest nothing to palliate to Edgar the step Mrs. Arlbery was taking, yet could still  less bear to leave Edgar to wild conjecture and certain blame: and Mrs. Arlbery was  standing irresolute and thoughtful, when Mr. Tyrold came to summon Mrs. Arlbery.
After mildly representing the indecorum of detaining any one Mrs. Arlbery was to receive  by appointment, Mr. Tyrold took Mrs. Arlbery apart, and putting a packet into Mrs. Arlbery hand, 'I would  not,' Mr. Tyrold said, 'agitate your spirits this morning, by entering upon any topic  that might disturb you: I have therefore put upon paper what I most desire you  to consider.
You will find it a little sermon upon the difficulties and the  conduct of the female heart.
Read it alone, and with attention.
And now, Mrs. Arlbery, go quietly into the parlour, and let one brief and cheerful  good-morrow serve for every body alike.'
He then returned to He brother.
Mrs. Arlbery made Eugenia accompany Mrs. Arlbery down stairs, to avoid any solitary attack from  Edgar; He suffered any solitary attack from  Edgar to pass; but followed to the parlour, where Mrs. Arlbery hastily  bid adieu to Miss Margland and Indiana; but was stopt from running off by the  former, who said, 'I wish I had known you intended going out, for I designed  asking Sir Hugh for the chariot for He this morning, to make a very  particular visit.'
Camilla, in a hesitating voice, said Camilla should not use Camilla uncle's chariot.
'You walk then?'
'No, ... ma'am ... but—there is—there is a carriage—I believe, now at the  door.'
'O dear, whose?'
cried Indiana; 'do, pray, tell me where you are going?'
while  Edgar, still more curious than either, held out his hand to conduct Camilla, that  his might obtain better information.
'I am very glad your head-ache is so well,' said Miss Margland; 'but, pray—is  Mr. Mandlebert to be your chaperon?'
They both blushed, though both affected not to hear Camilla: but, before They could  quit the room, Indiana, who had run to a bow-window, exclaimed, 'Dear!
if there  is not Mrs. Arlbery in a beautiful high phaeton!'
Edgar, astonished, was now as involuntarily drawing back, as Camilla,  involuntarily, was hurrying on: but Miss Margland, insisting upon an answer,  desired to know if Miss Margland should return to dinner?
Miss Margland stammered out, No.
Miss Margland Miss Margland pursued Miss Margland to ask at what time her uncle's chariot was to fetch Miss Margland; and forced from Miss Margland a confession that Miss Margland should be  away for some days.
Miss Margland was now permitted to proceed.
Edgar, impressed with the deepest  displeasure, leading Miss Margland in silence across the hall: but, stopping an instant  at the door, 'This excursion,' Edgar gravely said, 'will rescue you from no little  intended importunity: I had purposed tormenting you, from time to time, for  your opinion and directions with respect to Miss Eugenia.'
And then, bowing coldly to Mrs. Arlbery, who eagerly called out to welcome Miss Margland,  Edgar placed Miss Margland in the phaeton, which instantly drove off.
Edgar looked after Mrs. Arlbery, who eagerly called out to welcome her for some time, almost incredulous of Miss Margland departure: but,  as Edgar amazement subsided into certainty, the most indignant disappointment  succeeded.
That Miss Margland could leave Cleves at the very moment Cleves was reinstated in  its society, seemed conviction to Cleves of Miss Margland indifference; and that Miss Margland could  leave its in the present state of the affairs of Eugenia, made Cleves conclude Miss Margland  so great a slave to the love of pleasure, that every duty and all propriety  were to be sacrificed to its pursuit.
'I will think of Miss Margland,' cried Cleves, 'no  more!
Miss Margland concealed from me Miss Margland plan, lest I should torment Miss Margland with  admonitions: the glaring homage of the Major is better adapted to Miss Margland  taste,—She flies from my sincerity to receive his adulation,—I have been  deceived in Miss Margland disposition,—I will think of Miss Margland no more!'
