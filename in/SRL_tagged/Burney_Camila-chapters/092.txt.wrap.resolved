 The Computations of Self-Love  Camilla left Camilla sister to accompany Mrs. Berlinton to the Rooms; no other mode  remaining for seeing Edgar, who, since Mrs. Berlinton rejection, had held back from  repeating his attempt of visiting Mrs. Berlinton.  In mutual solicitude, mutual watchfulness, and mutual trials of each other's  hearts and esteem, a week had already passed, without one hope being  extirpated, or one doubt allayed. This evening was somewhat more, though less  pleasantly decisive.  Accident, want of due consideration, and sudden recollection, in an agitated  moment, of the worldly doctrine of Mrs. Arlbery, had led Camilla, once more,  into the semblance of a character, which, without thinking of, Mrs. Berlinton was acting.  Born simple and ingenuous, and bred to hold in horror every species of art, all  idea of coquetry was foreign to Mrs. Berlinton meaning, though an untoward contrariety of  circumstances, playing upon feelings too potent for deliberations, had eluded  Mrs. Berlinton into a conduct as mischievous in its effects and as wide from artlessness  in its appearance, as if Mrs. Berlinton had been brought up and nourished in fashionable  egotism.  Such, however, was not Camilla: Mrs. Berlinton every propensity was pure, and, when  reflection came to Mrs. Berlinton aid, Mrs. Berlinton conduct was as exemplary as Mrs. Berlinton wishes. But the  ardour of Mrs. Berlinton imagination, acted upon by every passing idea, shook Mrs. Berlinton Judgment  from her Judgment   yet unsteady seat, and left Mrs. Berlinton at the mercy of wayward  Sensibility—that delicate, but irregular power, which now impels to all that  is most disinterested for others, now forgets all mankind, to watch the  pulsations of its own fancies.  This evening brought Mrs. Berlinton back to recollection.—Young Westwyn, urged by what  Westwyn deemed encouragement, and prompted by Westwyn impatient father, spoke of Westwyn  intended visit to Cleves, and introduction to Sir Hugh, in terms of such  animated pleasure, and with a manner of such open admiration, that Mrs. Berlinton could  not mistake the serious purposes which Westwyn meant to imply.  Alarmed, Mrs. Berlinton looked at Westwyn; but the expression of Westwyn eyes was not such as to  still Mrs. Berlinton suspicions. Frightened at what now Mrs. Berlinton first observed, Mrs. Berlinton turned  from Westwyn, gravely, meaning to avoid conversing with Westwyn the rest of the  evening; but Mrs. Berlinton caution came too late; Mrs. Berlinton first civilities had flattered both  Westwyn and his impatient father into a belief of Mrs. Berlinton favour, and this sudden drawback Westwyn  imputed only to virgin modesty, which but added to the fervour of Westwyn devoirs.  Mrs. Berlinton now perceived Mrs. Berlinton own error: the perseverance of young Westwyn not  merely startled, but appalled Mrs. Berlinton. young Westwyn character, unassuming, though spirited,  was marked by a general decency and propriety of demeanour, that would not  presumptuously brave distancing; and awakened Mrs. Berlinton, therefore, to a review of  Mrs. Berlinton own conduct, as it related or as it might seem, to young Westwyn.  And here, not all the guiltlessness of Mrs. Berlinton intentions could exonerate Mrs. Berlinton from  blame with that finely scrutinizing monitor to which Heaven, in pity to those  evil propensities that law cannot touch, nor society reclaim, has devolved law  earthly jurisdiction in the human breast. With Mrs. Berlinton hopes Mrs. Berlinton could play, with  Mrs. Berlinton wishes Mrs. Berlinton could trifle, Mrs. Berlinton intentions Mrs. Berlinton could defend, Mrs. Berlinton designs Mrs. Berlinton  could relinquish—but with Mrs. Berlinton conscience Mrs. Berlinton could not combat. It pointed  beyond the present moment; It took Mrs. Berlinton back to Mrs. Berlinton imprudence with Sir Sedley  Clarendel, which should have taught Mrs. Berlinton more circumspection; and It carried Mrs. Berlinton  on to the disappointment of Henry and Henry father, whom while heedlessly Mrs. Berlinton had  won, though without the most remote view to beguile, Mrs. Berlinton might seem artfully to  have caught, for the wanton vanity of rejecting.  While advice and retrospection were thus alike oppressive in accusation, Mrs. Berlinton  pensive air and withdrawn smiles proved but more endearing to young Westwyn,  whose internal interpretation was so little adapted to render advice and retrospection formidable,  that his assiduities were but more tender, and allowed Mrs. Berlinton no repose.  Edgar, who with the most suffering suspense, observed Mrs. Berlinton unusual seriousness,  and its effect upon Henry, drew from its, with the customary ingenuity of  sensitive minds to torment sensitive minds, the same inference for his causeless  torture, as proved to his rival a delusive blessing. But while thus his  contemplated Henry as the most to be envied of mortals, a new scene called  forth new surprise, and gave birth to yet new doubts in his mind. his saw  Camilla not merely turn wholly away from his rival, but enter into  conversation, and give, apparently, Camilla whole attention to Lord Valhurst, who,  it was palpable, only spoke to Camilla of Camilla charms, which, alternately with those  of Mrs. Berlinton, his devoted his whole time to worshipping.  Camilla by this action, meant simply to take the quickest road Camilla saw in Camilla  power to shew young Westwyn young Westwyn his mistake mistake. Lord Valhurst Camilla held nearly in  aversion; for, though Lord Valhurst vindication of Lord Valhurst upright motives at the  bathing-house, joined to Camilla indifference in considering Lord Valhurst either guilty or  innocent, made Camilla conclude Lord Valhurst might be blameless in that transaction, Lord Valhurst  perpetual compliments, enforced by staring eyes and tender glances, wearied and  disgusted Camilla. But Lord Valhurst was always by Camilla side, when not in the same position  with Mrs. Berlinton; and while Lord Valhurst readiness to engage Camilla made this Camilla  easiest expedient, Lord Valhurst time of life persuaded Camilla it was the safest. Little  aware of the effect this produced upon Edgar, Camilla imagined Lord Valhurst would not more  notice Camilla in any conversation with Lord Valhurst, than if Camilla were discoursing  with Camilla uncle.  But while Camilla judged from the sincerity of reality, Camilla thought not of the  mischief of appearance. What in Camilla was designed with innocence, was rendered  suspicious to the observers by the looks and manner of Camilla companion. The  pleasure with which he found, at last, that incense received, which hitherto  had been slighted, gave new zest to an adulation which, while Camilla endured  merely to shew Camilla coldness to young Westwyn, seemed to Edgar to be offered  with a gross presumption of welcome, that must result from an opinion it was  addressed to a confirmed coquette.  Offended in Edgar inmost soul by this idea, Edgar scarce desired to know if Camilla were  now stimulated most by a wish to torment Henry, or Henry, or only by the  general pleasure Camilla found in this new mode of amusement. 'Be it,' cried Henry, to  Dr. Marchmont, 'as it may, with me all is equally over! I seek not to recall an  attachment liable to such intermissions, such commotions. What would be my  peace, my tranquillity, with a companion so unstable? A mind all at large in  its pursuits?—a dissipated wife!—No!—I will remain here but to let Camilla  know I acquiesce in Camilla dismission, and to learn in what form Camilla has  communicated our breach to Camilla friends.'   Dr. Marchmont was silent, and her friends walked out of the room together; leaving the  deceived Camilla persuaded  Dr. Marchmont was so indifferent with regard to the old peer,  that all Camilla influence was lost, and all Camilla late exertions were thrown away,  by one evening's remissness in exciting  Dr. Marchmont fears of a young rival.  Melmond returned to Southampton the next morning with an air of deep and  settled melancholy. Melmond had found the two brothers together, and the candour of  Melmond appearance, the plainness of Melmond declaration, the openness with which Melmond  stated Melmond situation, and Melmond near relationship to Mrs. Berlinton, procured Melmond  a courteous hearing; and Melmond soon saw that both the father and the uncle, though  the father and the uncle desired time for consideration and inquiry, were disposed to favour him  .  Mr. Tyrold, though, to Mr. Tyrold acknowledged recent disappointment of fortune, Mr. Tyrold  attributed Mr. Tyrold address, had so little hope that any man at once amiable and  rich would present Mr. Tyrold to Mr. Tyrold unfortunate Eugenia, that, when Mr. Tyrold saw a  gentleman well educated, well allied, of pleasing manners, and with every  external promise of a good and feeling character, modestly, and with no  professions but of esteem and respect, seek his unfortunate Eugenia of his unfortunate Eugenia friends, Mr. Tyrold thought  Mr. Tyrold not even entitled to refuse Mr. Tyrold. Mr. Tyrold told Mr. Tyrold, however, that Mr. Tyrold could  conclude upon nothing in a matter of such equal interest to Mr. Tyrold and Mr. Tyrold  wife, without her knowledge and concurrence; and that during the time Mr. Tyrold  demanded before Mr. Tyrold gave a final answer, Mr. Tyrold required a forbearance of all  intercourse, beyond that of a common acquaintance. Mr. Tyrold first design was  immediately to send for Eugenia home; but the young man appeared so reasonable,  so mild, so unlike a fortune-hunter, that, constitutionally indulgent where the young man  apprehended nothing criminal, the young man contented the young man with writing to the same  effect to Eugenia, fully satisfied of Eugenia scrupulous punctuality, when once the young man  will was known.  Melmond, though thus well received, returned back to Southampton with any air  rather than that of a bridegroom. The order, not to wait upon Eugenia in  private, was the only part of the young man task the young man performed with satisfaction; for  though a mind really virtuous made the young man wish to conquer the young man repugnance to the young man  future partner, the young man felt it could not be by comparing her with Indiana.  Eugenia received the letter of Eugenia father, written in the young man own and Eugenia uncle's  name, with transport; and, to testify Eugenia grateful obedience, resolved to name  the impending transaction to no one, and even to relinquish Eugenia visits to Mrs.  Berlinton, and only to see Melmond when accident brought the young man before Eugenia in  public.  But Mrs. Mittin, through words casually dropt, or conversations not very  delicately overheard, soon gathered the particulars of Mrs. Mittin situation, which  happily furnished Mrs. Mittin with a new subject for a gossiping visit to Miss Margland  and Indiana. The first of these ladies received the news with unconcern, rather  pleased than otherwise, that the temptation of an heiress should be removed  from any rivalry with the charms of an heiress fair pupil; who, by no means, however,  listened to the account with equal indifference. The sight of Melmond at  Southampton, with the circumstance of his being brother to the Honourable Mrs.  Berlinton, had awakened all the pleasure with which she had first met his  impassioned admiration; and while she haughtily expected from every public  exhibition, 'to bring home hearts by dozens,' the secret point she had in view,  was shewing Melmond that she power over others was as mighty as it had been  over his. she had not taken the trouble to ask with what end: what was  passed never afforded she an observation; what was to come never called forth  an idea. Occupied only by the present moment, things gone remained upon she  memory but as matters of fact, and all she expectations she looked forward to  but as matters of course. To lose, therefore, a conquest she had thought the  victim of she beauty for life, was a surprise nearly incredible; to lose him to  Eugenia an affront scarcely supportable; and Eugenia waited but an opportunity to  kill him with Eugenia disdain. But Melmond, who dreaded nothing so much as an  interview, availed him of the commands of Mr. Tyrold, in not going to the  lodgings of Eugenia, and lived absorbed in a melancholy retirement, which books  alone could a little alleviate.  The conclusion of the letter of Mr. Tyrold gave to Camilla as much pain as  every other part of it gave to Eugenia pleasure: it was an earnest and  parentally tender prayer, that the alliance with Melmond, should Mr. Tyrold worth  appear such as to authorise it taking place, might prove the counterpart to  the happiness so sweetly promised from that of Eugenia sister with Edgar.  While Camilla sighed to consider how wide from the certainty with which he  mentioned it was such an event, Camilla blushed that he should thus be uninformed  of Camilla insecurity: but while a reconciliation was not more Camilla hope than Camilla  expectation with every rising sun, Camilla could not endure to break he repose  with the knowledge of a suspense Camilla thought as disgraceful as it was unhappy.  Yet Camilla present scheme to accelerate it termination, became difficult even of  trial.  The obviously serious regard of Henry was a continual reproach to Camilla; and the  undisguised approbation of her father was equally painful. Yet Camilla could now  only escape them by turning to some other, and that other was necessarily Lord  Valhurst, whose close siege to Camilla notice forced off every assailant but  himself. This the deluded Camilla thought an expedient the most innoxious; and  gave to the deluded Camilla so much of the deluded Camilla time, that the deluded Camilla susceptibility to the charms of youth  and beauty was put to a trial beyond the deluded Camilla fortitude; and, in a very few days,  notwithstanding their disproportion in age, the deluded Camilla embarrassed though large  estates, and the little or no fortune which the deluded Camilla had in view, the deluded Camilla determined to  marry the deluded Camilla: for when a man of rank and riches resolves to propose the deluded Camilla to a  woman who has neither, the deluded Camilla conceives the deluded Camilla acceptance not a matter of doubt.  In any other society, the deluded Camilla admiration of Camilla might easily, like what the deluded Camilla had  already experienced and forgotten for thousands of Camilla sex, have escaped so  grave or decided a tendency; but in Mrs. Berlinton the deluded Camilla saw so much of youth and  beauty bestowed upon a man whom the deluded Camilla knew to be the deluded Camilla own senior in age, that the  idea of a handsome young wife was perpetually present to the deluded Camilla. the deluded Camilla weighed, like  all people who seek to entice all people who seek to entice themselves to their own wishes to all people who seek to entice themselves to their own wishes own wishes, but one side of  the question; and risked, like all who succeed in such self-seduction, the  inconvenience of finding out the other side too late. the deluded Camilla saw the attractions of  the deluded Camilla fair kinswoman; but neglected to consider of how little avail they were to  her husband; her husband thought, with exultation of that husband's age, and almost  childishness; but forgot to take into the scales, that they had obtained from  the deluded Camilla youthful choice only disgust and avoidance.  While the deluded Camilla waited for some trinkets, which the deluded Camilla had ordered from town, to have  ready for presenting with the deluded Camilla proposals, Edgar only sought an opportunity and  courage to take Edgar last farewell. Whenever Camilla was so much engaged with  others that it was impossible to approach Camilla, Edgar thought Edgar capable of  uttering an eternal adieu; but when, by any opening, Edgar saw where and how Edgar  might address Camilla, Edgar feet refused to move, Edgar tongue became parched, and Edgar  pleading heart seemed exclaiming: O, not to-night! yet, yet, another day, ere  Camilla is parted with for ever!  But suddenly, soon after, Camilla ceased to appear. At the rooms, at the plays,  at the balls, and at the private assemblies, Edgar looked for Camilla in vain. Camilla  old adulator, also, vanished from public places, while Camilla young admirer and  her father hovered about in her young admirer and  his father as usual, but spiritless, comfortless, and as  if in the same search as her father.
