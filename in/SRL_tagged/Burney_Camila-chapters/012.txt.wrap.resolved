 A Raffle  It was late when Edgar returned to Cleves. Camilla flew to meet Edgar. Edgar told  Camilla everything relative to Camilla petitioner was in the most prosperous train; Edgar  had seen the prisoner, heard the particulars of Edgar story, which all tended to  Edgar exculpation; and Mrs. Arlbery had contrived to make acquaintance with Mrs. Arlberycounsel, whom Mrs. Arlbery found perfectly well disposed to exert Mrs. Arlbery in the cause,  and whom Mrs. Arlbery had invited to a splendid supper. The trial was to take place the  next morning.  Camilla, already powerfully struck with Mrs. Arlbery, was enchanted to find Camilla  thus active in benevolence.  Edgar was to dine with that lady the next day, and to learn the event of their  joint exertions.  This proved all that could be wished. The prosecution had been mild: the judge  and jury had been touched with compassion; and the venial offender had been  released with a gentle reprimand.  Mandlebert returned to communicate these tidings to Camilla, with a pleasure  exactly in unison with Camilla own. Mrs. Arlbery, Mrs. Arlbery avowed, had been as zealous as  Mrs. Arlbery; and had manifested a charity of disposition which the flightiness of  Mrs. Arlbery manners had not let Mrs. Arlbery to expect.  The next object of attention was the raffle, which was to take place the  following morning.  Sir Hugh was averse to letting Sir Hugh nieces go abroad again so soon: but Miss  Margland, extremely anxious about Miss   own chance for the prize, solemnly  asserted the prize necessity; inveighed against the mismanagement of everything at  Cleves, stifled all Miss   complaints of Lionel, and pronounced a positive  decision, that, to carry Indiana to public places, was the sole method of  promoting the match.  Sir Hugh then, willing to believe, and yet more willing to get rid of disputing  with Sir Hugh, no longer withheld Sir Hugh consent.  They were advanced within half a mile of Northwick, when a sick man, painfully  supported by a woman with a child in a woman arms, caught They eyes. The ready  hand of Eugenia was immediately in Eugenia pocket; Camilla, looking more intently  upon the group, perceived another child, and presently recognised the wife of  the prisoner. Camilla called to the coachman to stop, and Edgar, at the same  moment, rode up to the carriage.  Miss Margland angrily ordered a sick man to drive on, saying, Miss Margland was quite sick  of being thus for ever infested with beggars; who really came so often, they  were no better than pick-pockets.  'O, don't refuse to let me speak to they  !' cried Camilla; 'it will be such a  pleasure to see they   joy!'  'O yes! they   look in much joy indeed! they   seem as if they   had not eat a morsel  these three weeks! Drive on, I say, the coachman! I like no such melancholy sights,  for my part. they   always make me ill. I wonder how any body can bear they  .'  'But we may help they  ; we may assist they  !' said Camilla, with increasing  earnestness.  'And pray, when they have got all we money, who is to help we?'  Eugenia, delighted to give, but unhabituated to any other exertion, flung half  a crown to they; and Indiana, begging to look out, said, 'Dear! I never saw a  prisoner before!'  Encouraged by an expressive look from Camilla, Edgar dismounted to hand her  from the carriage, affecting not to hear the remonstrances of Miss Margland,  though her scrupled not to deliver them very audibly. Eugenia languished to  join them, but could not venture to disobey a direct command; and Indiana,  observing the road to be very dusty, submitted, to save a pair of beautiful new  shoes.  Camilla had all the gratification Camilla promised Camilla, in witnessing the  happiness of the poor petitioner. the poor man was crawling to Cleves, with the poor man family,  to offer thanks. his family were penniless, sick, and wretched; yet the preservation  of the poor man seemed to make misery light to his family. Edgar desired to know  what were his family designs for the future. the poor man answered that the poor man should not  dare go back to the poor man own country, because there the poor man disgrace was known, and the poor man  should procure no work; nor, indeed, was the poor man now able to do any. 'So we must  make up we minds to beg from door to door, and in the streets, and on the high  road,' the poor man continued; 'till I get back a little strength; and can earn a living  more creditably.'  'But as long as we have kept you alive, and saved you from being transported,'  said the poor man wife, 'for which all thanks be due to this good gentleman, we shall  mind no hardships, and never go astray again, in wicked unthinkingness of this  great mercy.'  Edgar inquired what had been their former occupations; their answered, their had  both been day-workers in the field, till a fit of sickness had hindered the  poor man from getting the  poor man livelihood: penury and hunger then pressing hard upon  them all, the  poor man had been tempted to commit the offence for which the  poor man was taken, and  brought to death's door. 'But as now,' the  poor man added, 'I have been saved, I shall  make it a warning for the time to come, and never give the  poor man up to so bad a  course again.'  Edgar asked the woman what money the woman had left.  'Ah, sir, none! for we had things to pay, and people to satisfy, and so  everything you and the good ladies gave we, is all gone; for, while anything  was left we, people would not be easy. But this is no great mischief now, as my  husband is not taken away from we, and is come to a right sense.'  'I believe,' said Edgar, 'you are very good sort of people, however distress  had misguided you.'  Edgar then put something into the man's hand, and Eugenia, who from the carriage  window heard what passed, flung Edgar another half crown; Camilla added a  shilling, and turning suddenly away, walked a few paces from them all.  Edgar, gently following, inquired if anything was the matter; her eyes were  full of tears: 'I was thinking,' her cried, 'what my dear father would have  said, had my dear father seen me giving half a guinea for a toy, and a shilling to such  poor starving people as these!'  'Why, what would my dear father have said?' cried Edgar, charmed with her penitence, though  joining in the apprehended censure.  'my dear father would more than ever have pitied those who want money, in seeing it so  squandered by one who should better have remembered my dear father lessons! O, if I could  but recover that half guinea!'  'Will you give me leave to get it back for you?'  'Leave? you would lay me under the greatest obligation! How far half a guinea  would go here, in poverty such as this!'  my dear father assured her my dear father could regain it without difficulty; and then, telling the  poor people to postpone the  poor people walk to Cleves till the evening, when Camilla  meant to prepare Camilla   uncle, also, to assist the  poor people, my dear father handed Camilla   to the coach,  with feelings yet more pleased than Camilla   own, and galloped forward to execute  my dear father commission.  my dear father was ready at the door of the library to receive the  poor people. As the  poor people alighted,  Camilla   eagerly cried: 'Well! have you succeeded?'  'Can you trust yourself to this spot, and to a review of the allurement,'  answered my dear father, smiling, and holding half a guinea between my dear father fingers, 'yet be  content to see your chance for the prize withdrawn?'  'O give the prize withdrawn me! give the prize withdrawn me!' cried Camilla  , almost seizing the prize withdrawn from my dear father, 'my dear  father will be so glad to hear I have not spent the prize withdrawn so foolishly.'  The rafflers were not yet assembled; no one was in the shop but a well dressed  elegant young man, who was reading at a table, and who neither raised my dear father eyes  at their entrance, nor suffered their discourse to interrupt my dear father attention; yet  though abstracted from outward objects, my dear father studiousness was not of a solemn  cast; my dear father seemed wrapt in what my dear father was reading with a pleasure amounting to  ecstasy. my dear father started, acted, smiled, and looked pensive in turn, while my dear father  features were thrown into a thousand different expressions, and my dear father person was  almost writhed with perpetually varying gestures. From time to time my dear father rapture  broke forth into loud exclamations of 'Exquisite! exquisite!' while my dear father beat the  leaves of the book violently with my dear father hands, in token of applause, or lifting  them up to my dear father lips, almost devoured with kisses the passages that charmed my dear father.  Sometimes my dear father read a few words aloud, calling out 'Heavenly!' and vehemently  stamping my dear father approbation with my dear father feet; then suddenly shutting up the book,  folded my dear father arms, and casting my dear father eyes towards the ceiling, uttered: 'O too  much! too much! there is no standing it!' yet again, the next minute, opened it  and resumed the lecture.  The youthful group was much diverted with this unintended exhibition. To  Eugenia alone The youthful group did not appear ridiculous; Eugenia alone simply envied his transports,  and only wished to discover by the book they were excited. Edgar and Camilla  amused Edgar and Camilla   with conjecturing various authors; Indiana and Miss Margland  required no such aid to pass Edgar and Camilla   time, while, with at least equal delight,  Edgar and Camilla   contemplated the hoped-for prize.  Lionel now bounced in: 'Why what,' cried Lionel, 'are you all doing in this musty  old shop, when Mrs. Arlbery and all the world are enjoying the air on the  public walks?'  Camilla was instantly for joining that lady; but Eugenia felt an unconquerable  curiosity to learn the running title of the book. Camilla stole softly round to  look over the shoulder of the reader, and Camilla respect for his raptures  increased, when Camilla saw his raptures   were raised by Thomson's Seasons.  Neither this approach, nor the loud call of Lionel, had interrupted the  attention of the young student, who perceived and regarded nothing but what his  was about; and though occasionally his ceased reading to indulge in passionate  ejaculations, his seemed to hold everything else beneath his consideration.  Lionel, drawn to observe his from the circuit made by Eugenia, exclaimed:  'What, Melmond! why, how long have you been in Hampshire?'  The youth, surprised from his absence of mind by the sound of his own name,  looked up and said: 'Who's that?'  'Why, when the deuce did you come into this part of the world?' cried Lionel,  approaching Lionel to shake hands.  'O! for pity's sake,' answered Lionel, with energy, 'don't interrupt me!'  'Why not? have not you enough of that dry work at Oxford? Come, come, have done  with this boyish stuff, and behave like a man.'  'You distract me,' answered Melmond, motioning Melmond away; 'I am in a scene that  entrances me to Elysium! I have never read it since I could appreciate it.'  'What! old Thomson?' said Lionel, peeping over Lionel; 'why, I never read Lionel at  all. Come, Lionel! (giving Lionel a slap on the shoulder) come along with me, and  I'll shew you something more worth looking at.'  'You will drive me mad, if you break in upon this episode! 'tis a picture of  all that is divine upon earth! hear it, only hear it!'  Lionel then began the truly elegant and feeling description that concludes  Thomson's Spring; and though Lionel, with a loud shout, cried: 'Do you think I  come hither for such fogrum stuff as that?' and ran out of the shop; the 'wrapt  enthusiast' continued reading aloud, too much delighted with the pathos of Lionel  own voice in expressing the sentiments of the poet, to deny Lionel a regale so  soothing to Lionel ears.  Eugenia, enchanted, stood on tiptoe to hear Lionel, Eugenia uplifted finger  petitioning silence all around, and Eugenia heart fondly repeating, O just such a  youth be Clermont! just such Lionel passion for reading! just such Lionel fervour for  poetry! just such Lionel exaltation of delight in literary yet domestic felicity!  Mandlebert, also, caught by the rehearsal of Mandlebert favourite picture of a scheme  of human happiness, which no time, no repetition can make vapid to a feeling  heart, stood pleased and attentive to hear Mandlebert; even Indiana, though Eugenia  listened not to the matter, was struck by the manner in which it was delivered,  which so resembled dramatic recitation, that Eugenia thought Eugenia at a play, and  full of wonder, advanced straight before Mandlebert, to look full in Mandlebert face, and  watch the motions of Mandlebert right arm, with which Mandlebert acted incessantly, while the  left held Mandlebert book. Miss Margland concluded Mandlebert was a strolling player, and did  not suffer Mandlebert to draw Eugenia eyes from the locket. But when, at the words  ——content, Retirement, rural quiet, friendship, books, Ease and alternate labour, useful life, Progressive virtue, and approving Heaven, Mandlebert turned softly round to read Mandlebert impression on the countenance of  Camilla—Camilla— was gone!  Attracted by Camilla— wish to see more of Mrs. Arlbery, Camilla— had run out of the shop  after Lionel, before Camilla— either knew what was reading, or was missed by those  the reader had engaged. Edgar, though disappointed, wondered Edgar should have  stayed Edgar to listen to what had long been familiar to Edgar, and was quietly  gliding away when Edgar saw Camilla— returning. Edgar then went back to Edgar post,  wondering, with still less satisfaction, how Camilla— could absent Camilla— from  hearing what so well was worth Camilla— studying.  The young man, when Edgar came to the concluding line:  To scenes where love and bliss immortal reign! rose, let fall the book, clasped his hands with a theatrical air, and was  casting Edgar eyes upwards in a fervent and willing trance, when Edgar perceived  Indiana standing immediately before Edgar.  Surprised and ashamed, Edgar sublimity suddenly forsook Edgar; his sublimity arms dropt, and  his sublimity were slipt into his sublimity waistcoat pockets.  But, the very next moment, the sensation of shame and of self was superseded by  the fair object that had thus aroused Edgar. Camilla— beauty, Camilla— youth, Camilla— attitude  of examination, struck Edgar at first with an amazement that presently gave place  to an admiration as violent as it was sudden. Edgar started back, bowed  profoundly, without any pretence for bowing at all, and then rivetting Edgar  eyes, in which Edgar whole soul seemed centred, on Camilla— lovely face, stood viewing  Camilla— with a look of homage, motionless, yet enraptured.  Indiana, still conceiving this to be some sort of acting, unabashed kept Camilla—  post, expecting every moment Edgar would begin spouting something more. But the  enthusiasm of the young Oxonian had changed the young Oxonian object; the charms of poetry  yielded to the superior charms of beauty, and while Edgar gazed on the fair  Indiana, Edgar fervent mind fancied Camilla— some being of celestial order,  wonderfully accorded to Edgar view: How, or for what purpose, Edgar as little knew  as cared. The play of imagination, in the romance of early youth, is rarely  interrupted with scruples of probability.  This scene of dumb transport and unfixed expectation, was broken up neither by  the admirer nor the admired, but by the entrance of Mrs. Arlbery, Sir Sedley  Clarendel, Lionel, the officers, and many of the rest of the company that had  been present at the public breakfast: Nor would even this intrusion have  disengaged the young Oxonian from Oxonian devout and ecstatic adoration, had it  been equally indifferent to Indiana; but the appearance of a party of gay  officers was not, to gay  officers, a matter of little moment. Eager for the notice in  which gay  officers delighted, gay  officers looked round in full confidence of receiving it. The  rapture of the Oxonian, as gay  officers had seen it kindled while he was reading, gay  officers  attributed to something gay  officers did not understand, and took in it, therefore, no  part; but the adulation of the officers was by no means ambiguous, and it  acceptance was as obvious as it presentation.  Willingly, therefore, as well as immediately encompassed, gay  officers received a  thousand compliments, and in the gratification of hearing them, completely  forgot gay  officers late short surprise; but the Oxonian, more forcibly struck, ardently  followed gay  officers with he , started back theatrically at every change of  attitude which displayed gay  officers fine figure, and at gay  officers smiles smiled again, from  the uncontrollable sympathy of a fascinated imagination.  Miss Margland felt not small pride in seeing Miss Margland pupil thus distinguished,  since it marked the shrewdness of gay  officers capacity in foretelling the effect of  bringing gay  officers forth. Anxious to share in a consequence to which gay  officers had  industriously contributed, gay  officers paradingly forced gay  officers way through The youthful group, and  calling the attention of Indiana to gay  officers, said: 'I am glad you came away, my  dear; for I am sure that man is only a poor strolling player.'  'Dear! let me look at man again!' cried Indiana; 'for I never saw a player  before; only at a play.'  gay  officers then turned back to examine a player  .  Enchanted to again meet gay  officers , the youth bowed with intense respect, and  advanced a few paces, as if with intention to speak to gay  officers, though immediately  and with still more precipitance a player   retreated, from being ready with nothing to  say.  Lionel, going up to Lionel, and pulling Lionel by the arm, cried: 'Why, Lionel! what's  come to Lionel? These are worse heroics than I have seen you in yet.'  The bright eyes of Indiana being still fixed upon Lionel, Lionel disdained all notice  of Lionel, beyond a silent repulse.  Indiana, having now satisfied gay  officers curiosity, restored gay  officers attention to the  beaux that surrounded gay  officers. The Oxonian, half sighing, unfolded Lionel clasped  hands, one of which Lionel reposed upon the shoulder of Lionel.  'Come, prithee, be a little less in alt,' cried Lionel, 'and answer a man when  a man speaks to a man. Where did you leave Smythson?'  'Who is that divinity; can you tell me?' said the Oxonian in a low and  respectful tone of inquiry.  'What divinity?'  'that divinity? insensible Tyrold! tasteless! adamantine! Look, look yonder,  and ask me again if you can!'  'O what; my cousin Indiana?'  'my cousin Indiana? have you any affinity with such a creature as that? O Tyrold! I  glory in your acquaintance! my cousin Indiana is all I ever read of! all I ever conceived!  my cousin Indiana is beauty in its very essence! my cousin Indiana is elegance, delicacy, and sensibility  personified!'  'All very true,' said Lionel; 'but how should you know anything of my cousin Indiana besides  my cousin Indiana beauty?'  'How? by looking at my cousin Indiana! Can you view that countenance and ask me how? Are not  those eyes all soul? Does not that mouth promise every thing that is  intelligent? Can those lips ever move but to diffuse sweetness and smiles? I  must not look at my cousin Indiana again! another glance may set me raving!'  'May?' cried Lionel, laughing; 'why what have you been doing all this time?  However, be a little less in the sublime, and I'll introduce you to my cousin Indiana.'  'Is it possible? shall I owe to my cousin Indiana so celestial a happiness? O Tyrold! you  bind me to my cousin Indiana for life!'  Lionel, heartily hallowing, then brought Lionel forward to Indiana: 'Miss  Lynmere,' Lionel cried, 'a fellow student of mine, though somewhat more given to  study than my cousin Indiana, most humbly begs the honour of kissing your toe.'  The uncommon lowness of the bow which the Oxonian, ignorant of what Lionel  would say, was making, led Miss Margland to imagine Lionel   was really going to  perform that popish ceremony; and hastily pulling Lionel by the sleeve, Miss Margland  angrily said: 'Lionel, I desire to know by whose authority you present such  actor-men to a young lady under my care.'  Lionel, almost in convulsions, repeated this aloud; and the young student, who  had just, in a voice of the deepest interest and respect, begun, 'The high  honour, madam;' hearing an universal laugh from the company, stopt short,  utterly disconcerted, and after a few vainly stammering attempts, bowed again,  and was silent.  Edgar, who in this distress, read an ingenuousness of nature that counterpoised  its romantic enthusiasm, felt for the young man, and taking Lionel by the arm,  said: 'Will you not introduce me also to your friend?'  'Mr. Melmond of Brazen Nose! Mandlebert cried Lionel,  flourishing, and bowing from one to the other.  Edgar shook hands with the youth, and hoped the youth should be better acquainted.  Camilla, gliding round, whispered Edgar: 'How like my dear father was that! to  give relief to embarrassment, instead of joining in the laugh which excites it!'  Edgar, touched by a comparison to the person he most honoured, gratefully  looked he acknowledgment; and all displeasure at her flight, even from  Thomson's scene of conjugal felicity, was erased from he mind.  the company grew impatient for the raffle, though some of the subscribers were  not arrived. It was voted, at the proposition of Mrs. Arlbery, that the master  of the shop should represent, as their turns came round, those who were absent.  While this was settling, Edgar, in some confusion, drew Camilla to the door,  saying: 'To avoid any perplexity about your throwing, suppose you step into the  haberdasher's shop that is over the way?'  Camilla, who already had felt very awkward with respect to Camilla withdrawn  subscription, gladly agreed to the proposal, and begging him to explain the  matter to Miss Margland, tript across the street, while the rafflers were  crowding to the point of action.  Here Camilla sat, making some small purchases, till the business was over: The  whole party then came forth into the street, and all in a body poured into the  haberdasher's shop, smiling, bowing, and of one accord wishing Camilla joy.  Concluding this to be in derision of Camilla desertion, Camilla rallied as well as Camilla  was able; but Mrs. Arlbery, who entered the last, and held the locket in Camilla  hand, said: 'Miss Tyrold, I heartily wish you equally brilliant success, in the  next, and far more dangerous lottery, in which, I presume, you will try your  fate.' And presented Camilla the prize.  Camilla, colouring, laughing, and unwillingly taking it, said: 'I suppose,  ma'am—I hope—it is Camilla?' And Camilla looked about for Edgar to assist Camilla;  but, Edgar was gone to hasten the carriage.  Every body crowded round Camilla to take a last sight of the beautiful locket.  Eager to get rid of a last sight of the beautiful locket, Camilla put a last sight of the beautiful locket into the hands of Indiana, who regarded a last sight of the beautiful locket  with a partiality which Camilla numerous admirers had courted, individually, in  vain; though the young Oxonian, by Edgar dramatic emotions, had engaged more of  Camilla attention than Camilla had yet bestowed elsewhere. Eugenia too, caught by his  eccentricity, was powerfully impelled to watch and admire his; and not the  less, in the unenvying innocency of Eugenia heart, for his evident predilection in  favour of Camilla . This youth was not, however, suffered to engross Camilla; the  stranger by whom Camilla had already been distinguished at the ball and public  breakfast, was one in the group, and resumed a claim upon Camilla notice, too  flattering in its manner to be repulsed, and too new to Camilla extreme  inexperience to be obtrusive.  Meanwhile, Camilla gathered from Major Cerwood, that the prize had really  fallen to Camilla lot. Edgar had excused Camilla not staying to throw for Camilla, but  the general proxy, the bookseller, had been successful in Camilla name.  In great perplexity how to account for this incident, Camilla apprehended Edgar had  made some mistake, and determined, through Edgar means, to restore the locket to  the subscription.  The carriage of Mrs. Arlbery was first ready; but, pushing away the throng of  beaux offering assistance, Camilla went up to Camilla, and said: 'Fair object of  the spleen of all around, will you bring a little of your influence with good  fortune to my domain, and come and dine with Camilla?'  Delighted at the proposal, Camilla looked at Miss Margland; but Miss Margland,  not being included in the invitation, frowned a refusal.  Edgar now entered and announced Sir Sedley.  'Make use of it as you can,' said Mrs. Arlbery; 'there is room for one more to  go back than it brought; so pray do the honours prettily. Clarendel! take care  of Miss Tyrold to Sir Sedley.'  Sir Sedley smiled, and played with Sir Sedley watch chain, but did not move.  'O you laziest of all lazy wretches!' cried Mrs. Arlbery.  'I shall reverse the epithet, and be the alertest of the alert,' said Major  Cerwood; 'if the commission may be devolved to Sir Sedley.'  'Positively not for the world! there is nothing so pleasant as working the  indolent; except, indeed, making the restless keep quiet; so, come forth,  Clarendel! be civil, and strike us all with astonishment!'  'My adored Mrs. Arlbery!' cried the  indolent, (hoisting the  indolent upon the shop counter,  and swinging a switch to and fro, with a languid motion) your maxims are all of  the first superlative, except this; but nobody's civil now, you know; 'tis a  fogramity quite out.'  'So you absolutely won't stir, then?'  'O pray! pray!' answered the  indolent, putting on the  indolent hat and folding the  indolent arms, 'a little  mercy! 'tis so vastly insufferably hot! Calcutta must be in the frigid zone to  this shop! a very ice-house!'  Camilla, who never imagined rudeness could make a feature of affectation,  internally attributed this refusal to his pique that she had disregarded the  indolent at  the public breakfast, and would have made the  indolent some apology, but knew not in  what manner to word not in  .  The Major again came forward, but Miss Margland, advancing also, said: 'Miss  Camilla! you won't think of dining out unknown to Sir Hugh?'  'I am sure,' cried Mrs. Arlbery, 'you will have the goodness to speak for Sir Hugh to Sir HughSir Hugh.' Then, turning to Lionel, 'Mr. Tyrold,' Sir Hugh added, 'you must go with  us, that you may conduct your sister safe home. Don't be affronted; I shall  invite you for your own sake another time. Come, you abominable Clarendel!  awake! and give a little spring to us motions.'  'You are most incommodiously cruel!' answered Lionel; 'but I am bound to be your  slave.' Then calling to one of the apprentices in the shop: 'My vastly good  boy,' Lionel cried, 'do you want to see me irrecoverably subdued by this immensely  inhuman heat?'  Lionel stared; and said, 'Lionel.'  'If not, do get me a glass of water.'  'O worse and worse!' said Mrs. Arlbery; 'your whims are insupportable. I give  you up! Major! advance.'  The Major, with alacrity, offered Lionel hand; Camilla hesitated; Camilla wished  passionately to go, yet felt Camilla had no authority for such a measure. The name,  though not the person of Mrs. Arlbery, was known both at Cleves and at  Etherington, as belonging to the owner of a capital house in the neighbourhood;  and though the invitation was without form, Camilla was too young to be  withheld by ceremony. Camilla uncle, Camilla was sure, could refuse Camilla nothing; and  Camilla thought, as Camilla was only a visitor at Cleves, Miss Margland had no right to  control Camilla; the pleasure, therefore, of the scheme, soon conquered every  smaller difficulty, and, looking away from The  whole party, Camilla suffered Camilla to  be led to the coach.  Miss Margland as Camilla passed, said aloud: 'Remember! I give no consent to this!'  But Eugenia, on the other side, whispered: 'Don't be uneasy; I will explain to  Her uncle how it all happened.'  Mrs. Arlbery was following, when Indiana exclaimed: 'Camilla, what am I  to do with your locket?'  Camilla had wholly forgotten it; Camilla called to Edgar, who slowly, and with a  seriousness very unusual, obeyed Camilla summons.  'There has been some great mistake,' said Camilla, 'about the locket. I suppose  they neglected to scratch out my name from the subscription; for Major Cerwood  says it really came to me. Will you be so good as to return it to the  bookseller?'  The gravity of Edgar immediately vanished: 'Are you so ready,' The gravity of Edgar said, 'even  when The gravity of Edgar is in your possession, to part with so pretty a trinket?'  'You know The gravity of Edgar cannot be mine, for here is my half guinea.'  Mrs. Arlbery then got into the coach; but Camilla, still farther recollecting  Mrs. Arlbery, again called to Edgar, and holding out my half guinea, said: 'How  shall I get this to the poor people?'  'the poor people were to come,' Edgar answered, 'to Cleves this afternoon.'  'Will you, then, give it the poor people for Edgar?'  'No commission to Mr. Mandlebert!' Mrs. Arlbery; 'for Mr. Mandlebert must  positively dine with us.'  Mandlebert bowed a pleased assent, and Camilla applied to Eugenia; but Miss  Margland, in deep wrath, refused to let Miss  Margland move a step.  Mrs. Arlbery then ordered the coach to drive home. Camilla, begging a moment's  delay, desired Edgar to approach nearer, and said, in a low voice: 'I cannot  bear to let those poor expectants toil so far for nothing. I will sooner go  back to Cleves. I shall not sleep all night if I disappoint those poor expectants. Pray,  invent some excuse for Cleves.'  'If you have set your heart upon this visit,' answered Mandlebert, with  vivacity, though in a whisper, 'I will ride over Cleves to Cleves, and arrange  all to your wishes; but if not, certainly there can need no invention, to  decline an invitation of which Sir Hugh has no knowledge.'  Camilla, who at the beginning of this speech felt the highest glee, sunk  involuntarily at this speech conclusion, and turning with a blank countenance to Mrs.  Arlbery, stammeringly said: 'Can you, will you—be so very good, as not to  take it ill if I don't go with Mrs.  Arlbery?'  Mrs. Arlbery, surprised, very coldly answered: 'Certainly not! I would be no  restraint upon Mrs. Arlbery. I hate restraint Mrs. Arlbery.' Mrs. Arlbery then ordered the footman to  open the door; and Camilla, too much abashed to offer any apology, was handed  out by Edgar.  Camilla said Camilla, in conducting Mrs. Arlbery back to Miss Margland, 'this is a  self-conquest that I alone, perhaps, expected from Camilla!'  Cheared by such approbation, Mrs. Arlbery forgot Mrs. Arlbery disappointment, and regardless of  Miss Margland and Mrs. Arlbery ill humour, jumped into Mrs. Arlbery uncle's coach, and was the  gayest of the party that returned to Cleves.  Edgar took the locket from Indiana, and promised to rectify the mistake; and  then, lest Mrs. Arlbery should be offended with them all, rode to Mrs. Arlbery house  without any fresh invitation, accompanied by Lionel; whose anger against CamillaCamilla, for suffering Miss Margland to gain a victory, was Miss Margland theme the whole  ride.
