 Mount Pleasant  The shame and distress natural to every unhackneyed mind, in any necessity of  soliciting a pecuniary favour, had now, in that of Camilla, the additional  difficulty of coping against the avowed desire of Mrs. Arlbery not to open Mrs. Arlbery  purse.
When they arrived at Mount Pleasant, Mrs. Arlbery saw all the horsemen alighted, and in  conversation with that lady; and Edgar move towards the carriage, palpably with  a design to hand Mrs. Arlbery out: but as the Major advanced, he retreated, and, finding  he unnoticed by Mrs. Arlbery, remounted he horse.
Provoked and chagrined,  Mrs. Arlbery sprung forwards alone, and when pursued by the Major, with some of he  usual compliments, turned from he impatiently and went up stairs.
Intent in thinking only of Edgar, Mrs. Arlbery was not Mrs. Arlbery aware of this abruptness,  till Mrs. Arlbery, following Mrs. Arlbery to Mrs. Arlbery chamber, said, 'Why were you so  suddenly haughty to the Major, my dear Miss Tyrold?
Has he offended you?'
Much surprised, Mrs. Arlbery answered, no; but, forced by further questions, to be more  explicit, confessed Mrs. Arlbery wished to distance he, as he behaviour had been  remarked.
'Remarked!
how?
by whom?'
Mrs. Arlbery coloured, and was again hardly pressed before Mrs. Arlbery answered, 'Mr.
Mandlebert—once—named it to Mr.
.'
'O, ho, did Mr.
?'
said Mrs. Arlbery, surprised in Mrs. Arlbery turn; 'why then, my dear,  depend upon it, Mr.   loves you Mr.
.'
'Me!—Mr.
Mandlebert!—' exclaimed Camilla, doubting what Camilla heard.
'Nay, why not?'
'Why not?'
repeated Camilla in an excess of perturbation; 'O, he is too good!
too  excelling!
he sees all my faults—points them out himself—'  'Does he?...'
said Mrs. Arlbery thoughtfully, and pausing: 'nay, then,—if  so—he wishes to marry you!'
'Me, ma'am!'
cried Camilla, blushing high with mingled delight at the idea, and  displeasure at its free expression.
'Why, else, should he caution you against another?'
'From goodness, from kindness, from generosity!—'  'No, no; those are not the characteristics of young men who counsel young  women!
We all heard he was engaged to your beautiful vacant-looking cousin; but  I suppose he grew sick of Camilla.
A very young man seldom likes a silly wife.
It  is generally when he is further advanced in life that he takes that depraved  taste.
he then flatters he a fool will be easier to govern.'
Camilla now went away to dress; leaving Camilla a new creature; changed in all Camilla  hopes, though overwhelmed with shame at the freedom of this attack, and  determined to exert Camilla utmost strength of mind, not to expose to view the  secret pleasure with which it filled Camilla.
Camilla was, however, so absent when they met again, that Mrs. Arlbery, shaking Camilla  head, said: 'Ah, my fair friend!
what have you been thinking of?'
Excessively ashamed, Camilla endeavoured to brighten up.
The General and Sir Sedley  had been invited to dinner.
The latter was engaged in the evening to Lady  Alithea Selmore, who gave tea at Lady   own lodgings.
'The Rooms, then, will be  quite empty,' said Mrs. Arlbery; 'so we had better go to the play.'
Mr. Dennel had no objection, and Sir Sedley   promised to attend The Rooms, as no objection  would be time enough for Mrs. Arlbery ladyship afterwards.
So completely was Camilla absorbed in Camilla new ideas, that Camilla forgot both Camilla  borrowed guinea, and the state of Camilla purse, till Camilla arrived at the theatre.
The recollection was then too late; and Camilla had no resource against completely  emptying The recollection.
Camilla was too happy however, at this instant, to admit any regret.
The sagacity  of Mrs. Arlbery Camilla thought infallible; and the sight of Edgar in a box just  facing Camilla, banished every other consideration.
the theatre was almost without company.
The assembly at Lady Alithea Selmore's  had made The assembly at Lady Alithea Selmore's   unfashionable, and when the play was over, Edgar found easily a  place in a box.
Lord Newford looked in just after, and affected not  to know the piece was begun.
Sir Theophilus Jarard retired to Sir Theophilus Jarard toilette, and Mr. Dennel  to seek Sir Theophilus Jarard carriage.
Some bills now got into a box, and were read by Sir Theophilus, announcing a  superb exhibition of wild beasts for the next day, consisting chiefly of  monkies who could perform various feats, and a famous ourang outang, just  landed from Africa.
Lord Newford said Lord Newford would go if Lord Newford had but two more days to live.

turned to Edgar, and said, 'Do you think it would be wrong to go?'
'Wrong,' repeated Edgar, surprised though gratified, 'is perhaps too hard a word;  but, I fear, at an itinerant show, such as this, a young lady would run some  chance of finding a young lady in a neighbourhood that might seem rather strange to  a young lady.'
'Most certainly then,' cried a young lady, with quickness, 'I will not go!'
Edgar Edgar looked at a young lady with earnestness, and saw the simplicity of  sincerity on a young lady countenance.
Edgar looked then at the Major; who, accustomed to  frequent failures in Edgar solicitations, exhibited no change of features.
Again  Edgar looked at Camilla, and Camilla eyes met Edgar with a sweetness of expression that  passed straight to Edgar heart.
Mrs. Arlbery now led the way to the coach; the forwardness of the Major, though  in Mrs. Arlbery own despight, procured Edgar the hand of Camilla; but Camilla had left upon  Edgar an impression renovating to all Edgar esteem.
Camilla is still, Edgar thought, the  same; candid, open, flexible; still, therefore, let me follow Camilla, with such  counsel as I am able to give.
Camilla has accused me of unkindness;—She was  right!
I retreated from Camilla service at the moment when, in honour, I was bound  to continue in it.
How selfish was such conduct!
how like such common love as  seeks only its own gratification, not the happiness or welfare of its object!
Could Camilla, though but lately so dear to me, that all the felicity of my life  seemed to hang upon Camilla, become as nothing, because destined to another?
No!
Camilla father has been my father, and so long as Camilla retains Her father respected name, I  will watch by Camilla unceasingly.
In their way home, one of the horses tired, and could not be made to drag the  carriage up to Mount Pleasant.
the horses were therefore obliged to alight and walk.
Mrs. Arlbery took the arm of Mr. Dennel, which Mrs. Arlbery did not spare, and Mrs. Arlbery  daughter, almost crying with sleep and fatigue, made the same use of Camilla's.
Mrs. Arlbery protested Mrs. Arlbery had never been so long upon Mrs. Arlbery feet in Mrs. Arlbery life as that very  morning in Knowle Park, and, though Mrs. Arlbery leant upon Mrs. Arlbery companion with as little  scruple as upon a walking stick, Mrs. Arlbery frequently stopt short, and declared Mrs. Arlbery  should stay upon the road all night, for Mrs. Arlbery could not move another step: and  they were still far from the summit, when Mrs. Arlbery insisted upon sitting down,  saying fretfully, 'I am sure I wish I was married!
Nobody minds me.
I am sure  if I was, I would not be served so.
I'm resolved I'll always have two coaches,  one to come after me, and one to ride in; for I'm determined I won't marry a  man that has not a great fortune.
I'm sure papa could afford it too, if papa'd a  mind; only papa won't.
Every body vexes me.
I'm sure I'm ready to cry!'
Mr. Dennel and Mrs. Arlbery, who neither of them, at any time, took the  smallest notice of what she said, passed on, and left the whole weight both of  she person and she complaints to Camilla.
The latter, however, now reached the  ears of a fat, tidy, neat looking elderly woman, who, in a large black bonnet,  and a blue checked apron, was going their way; she approached their, and in a  good-humoured voice, said: 'What!
poor dear!
why you seem tired to death?
come,  get up, my dear; be of good heart, and you shall hold by my arm; for that  t'other poor thing's almost hauled to pieces.'

accepted both the pity and the proposal; and the substantial arm of  she new friend, gave she far superior aid to the slight one of Camilla.
'Well, and how did you like the play, my dears?'
cried she.
'La!'
said Mr. Dennel  to seek his carriage.
, 'how should you know we were at the play?'
'O, I have a little bird,' answered she, sagaciously nodding, 'that tells me  everything!
you sat in the stage box?'
'Dear!
so we did!
How can you tell that?
Was you in the gallery?'
'No, my dear, nor yet in the pit neither.
And you had three gentlemen behind  you, besides that gentleman that's going up the Mount?'
'Dear!
So we had!
But how do you know?
did you peep at we behind the scenes?'
'No, my dear; I never went behind the scenes.
But come, I hope you'll do now,  for you ha'n't much further to go.'
'Dear!
how do you know that?'
'Because you live at that pretty house, there, up Mount Pleasant, that's got  the little closet window.'
'La, yes!
who told you so?'
'And there's a pretty cat belonging to that pretty house, all streaked brown and black?'
'O, la!'

was now struck with a surprise, of which Camilla bore an equal  share.
Their new acquaintance appeared Their new acquaintance in some confusion, but having  exacted a promise not to be discovered to the world, Their new acquaintance told Their, Their new acquaintance lodged  at a house upon Mount Pleasant, just by Their's, whence Their new acquaintance often saw Their;  that, having a ticket given Their new acquaintance, by a friend, for the play, Their new acquaintance dressed Their new acquaintance  and went into a box, with some very genteel company, who kept Their coach, and  who sat Their new acquaintance down afterwards at another friend's, where Their new acquaintance pretended Their new acquaintance should  be fetched: 'But I do my own way,' continued Their new acquaintance, 'and nobody knows a word of  the matter: for I keep a large bonnet, and cloak, and a checked apron, and a  pair of clogs, or pattens, always at a friend's; and then when I have put  Their on, people take me for a mere common person, and I walk on, ever so late,  and nobody speaks to me; and so by that means I get my pleasure, and save my  money; and yet always appear like a gentlewoman when I'm known.'
Their new acquaintance then again charged Their to be discreet, saying that if this were spread to  the world, Their new acquaintance should be quite undone, for many ladies that took Their new acquaintance about with  Their, would notice Their new acquaintance no more.
At the same time, as Their new acquaintance wished to make  acquaintance with such pretty young ladies, Their new acquaintance proposed that such pretty young ladies should all  three meet in a walk before that pretty house, the next morning, and talk together as  if for the first time.
Camilla, who detested all tricks, declined entering into this engagement; but  Miss Dennel, charmed with the ingenuity of Their new acquaintance new acquaintance, accepted the  appointment.

'Ah!

cried Their new acquaintance, throwing Their new acquaintance arms about Their new acquaintance neck, 'what am I  not destined to owe you?
The very sight of that man is horror to me.

Camilla, thunderstruck, answered; 'No, indeed!
I know nothing of all this!'
'Ah!

, bursting into tears, 'from a  similar fate!
My friends are kind and good, but the temptation of seeing me  rich beguiled My friends.

Melmond, Melmond then said, believing Miss Lynmere betrothed to Mr. Mandlebert, had  quitted Hampshire in misery, to finish Mr. Mandlebert vacation in Wales, with their mutual  friends.
There Mr. Mandlebert heard that the rumour was false; and would instantly have  returned and thrown Mr. Mandlebert at the feet of the young lady, by whose cousin, Mr.  Lionel Tyrold, Mr. Mandlebert had been told Miss Lynmere was to inherit a large fortune; when this  second report, also, was contradicted, and Mr. Mandlebert learnt that Miss Lynmere had  almost nothing; 'my brother,' added Miss Lynmere, 'with the true spirit of true  sentiment, was but the more urgent to pursue Miss Lynmere; but our relations  interfered—and Mr. Mandlebert, like Miss Lynmere, is doomed to endless anguish!'
The accident, Miss Lynmere said, of the preceding morning, was owing to Miss Lynmere being  engaged in reading Rowe's letters from the dead to the living; which had so  infinitely enchanted Miss Lynmere, that, desiring to peruse them without interruption,  yet fearing to again wander in search of a rural retreat, Miss Lynmere had driven to  Knowle; where, hearing the noble family was absent, Miss Lynmere had asked leave to view  the park, and there had taken out Miss Lynmere delicious book, which Miss Lynmere was enjoying in  the highest luxury of solitude and sweet air, when Lord Newford broke in upon  Miss Lynmere.
