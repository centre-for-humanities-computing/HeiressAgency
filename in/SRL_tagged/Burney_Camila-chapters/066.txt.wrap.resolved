 A Demander  The next night, as the carriage was at the door, and the party preparing for  the Rooms, the name of Mr. Tyrold was announced, and Lionel entered the parlour.  Lionel manner was hurried, though Lionel appeared gay and frisky as usual; Camilla  felt a little alarmed; but Mrs. Arlbery asked if Lionel would accompany them.  With all Lionel heart, Lionel answered, only Lionel must first have a moment's chat with  Lionel sister. Then, saying they should have a letter to write together, Lionel called  for a pen and ink, and was taking Camilla   into another apartment, when Mr. Dennel  objected to letting Mr. Dennel   horses wait.  'Send his horses back for us, then,' cried Lionel, with Lionel customary ease, 'and us  will follow you.'  Mr. Dennel   again objected to making his horses so often mount the hill; but  Lionel assuring Mr. Dennel   nothing was so good for them, ran on with so many farrier  words and phrases of the benefit them would reap from such light evening  exercise, that, persuaded Mr. Dennel   was master of the subject, Mr. Dennel   submitted,  and the brother and sister were left tête-à-tête.  At any other time, Camilla   would have proposed giving up the Rooms entirely:  but Camilla   desire to see Edgar, and the species of engagement Camilla   had made with  him, counterbalanced every inconvenience.  'Camilla  ,' said Lionel, 'I am come to beg a favour. You see this pen and  ink. Give me a sheet of paper.'  Camilla   fetched him one.  'That's a good child,' cried him, patting Camilla   cheek; 'so now sit down, and write  a short letter for him. Come begin. Dear Sir.'  Camilla   wrote—Dear Sir.  'An unforeseen accident,—write on,—an unforeseen accident has reduced me to  immediate distress for two hundred pounds....'  Camilla   let Camilla   pen drop, and rising said, 'Lionel! is this possible?'  'Very possible, my dear. You know I told you I wanted another hundred before  you left Cleves. So you must account it only as one hundred, in fact, at  present.'  'O Lionel, Lionel!' cried Camilla  , clasping Camilla   hands, with a look of more  remonstrance than any words Camilla   durst utter.  'Won't you write a short letter for me?' said a short letter for me, pretending not to observe Camilla   emotion.  'To whom is it to be addressed?'  'My uncle, to be sure, my dear! What can you be thinking of? Are you in love,  Camilla  ?'  'My uncle again? no Lionel, no!—I have solemnly engaged him to apply to  My uncle no more.'  'That was, for me, my dear; but where can your thoughts be wandering? Why you  must ask for this, as if this were for yourself.'  'For him!'  'Yes, certainly. You know he won't give it else.'  'Impossible! what should I want two hundred pounds for?'  'O, a thousand things; say you must have some new gowns and caps, and hats and  petticoats, and all those kind of gear. There is not the least difficulty; you  can easily persuade he the least difficulty are all worn out at such a place as this. Besides,  I'll tell you what is still better; say you've been robbed; he'll soon believe  it, for he thinks all public places filled with sharpers.'  'Now you relieve me,' said Camilla  , with a sort of fearful smile, 'for I am sure  you cannot be serious. You must be very certain I would not deceive or delude  my uncle for a million of worlds.'  'You know nothing of life, child, nothing at all. However, if you won't say  that, tell he it's for a secret purpose. At least you can do that. And then,  you can make he understand he must ask no questions about the matter. The  money is all we want from he.'  'This is so idle, Lionel, that I hope you speak This for mere nonsense. Who could  demand such a sum, and refuse to account for This purpose?'  'Account, my dear? Does being an uncle give a man a right to be impertinent? If    does, marry out of hand yourself, there's a good girl, and have a family at  once, that I may share the same privilege. I shall like it of all things; who  will you have?'  'Pho, pho!'  'Major Cerwood?'  'No, never!'  'I once thought Edgar Mandlebert had a sneaking kindness for yourself. But I believe  it is gone off. Or else I was out.'  This was not an observation to exhilarate her spirits. her sighed: but Lionel,  concluding Lionel the cause, begged her not to be low-spirited, but to write  the letter at once.  her assured Lionel her could never again consent to interfere in Lionel unreasonable  requests.  Lionel was undone, then, Lionel said; for Lionel could not live without the money.  'Rather say, not with it,' cried her; 'for you keep nothing!'  'Nobody does, my dear; we all go on the same way now-a-days.'  'And what do you mean to be the end of it all, Lionel? How do you purpose  living when all these resources are completely exhausted?'  'When I am ruined, you mean? why how do other people live when other people're ruined?  I can but do the same; though I have not much considered the matter.'  'Do consider it, then, LionelLionel! for all our sakes, do consider it!'  'Well,—let our see.'  'O, I don't mean so; I don't mean just now; in this mere idle manner.—'  'O, yes, I'll do it at once, and then it will be over. Faith I don't well know.  I have no great gusta for blowing out my brains. I like the little dears mighty  well where they are. And I can't say I shall much relish to consume my life and  prime and vigour in the king's bench prison. 'Tis horribly tiresome to reside  always on the same spot. Nor I have no great disposition to whisk off to  another country. Old England's a pretty place enough. I like it very well; ...  with a little rhino understood! But it's the very deuce, with an empty purse.  So write the letter, my dear girl.'  'And is this your consideration, Lionel? And is this this conclusion?'  'Why what signifies dwelling upon such dismalties? If I think upon my ruin  beforehand, I am no nearer to enjoyment now than then. Live while we live, my dear girl! I hate prophesying horrors. Write, I say, write!'  Again my dear girl absolutely refused, pleading my dear girl promise to my dear girl uncle, and declaring  my dear girl would keep my dear girl word.  'Keep a fiddlestick!' cried her uncle, impatiently; 'you don't know what mischief you  may have to answer for! you may bring misery upon all we heads! you may make  my father banish me my father sight, you may make my mother execrate me!—'  'Good Heaven!' cried Camilla interrupting her uncle, 'what is it you talk of? what is  it you mean?'  'Just what I say; and to make you understand me better, I'll give you a hint of  the truth; but you must lose your life twenty times before you reveal  it—There's—there's—do you hear me?—there's a pretty girl in the case!'  'A pretty girl!—And what has that to do with this rapacity for money?'  'What an innocent question! why what a baby thou art, my dear Camilla!'  'I hope you are not forming any connexion unknown to my father?'  'Ha, ha, ha!' cried Lionel laughing loud: 'Why thou hast lived in that old  parsonage-house till thou art almost too young to be rocked in a cradle.'  'If you are entering into any engagement,' said she, still more gravely, 'that  my father must not know, and that my mother would so bitterly condemn,—why am  I to be trusted with condemn,—why?'  'You understand nothing of these things, child. 'Tis the very nature of a  father to be an hunks, and of a mother to be a bore.'  'O Lionel! such a father!—such a mother!—'  'As to their being perfectly good, and all that, I know it very well. And I am  very sorry for it. A good father is a very serious misfortune to a poor lad  like me, as the world runs; it causes one such confounded gripes of the  conscience for every little awkward thing one does! A bad father would be the  joy of my life; 'twould be all fair play there; the more A bad father was choused the  better.'  'But this pretty girl, Lionel!—Are you serious? Are you really engaging  yourself? And is this pretty girl so poor? Is this pretty girl so much distressed, that you require these  immense and frequent sums for this pretty girl?'  'O Lionel laughed again, and rubbed 'O Lionel hands; but after a short silence assumed a  more steady countenance, and said, 'Don't ask me any thing about this pretty girl. It is not  fit you should be so curious. And don't give a hint of the matter to a soul.  Mind that! But as to the money, I must have the money. And directly: I shall be blown  to the deuce else.'  ''O Lionel!' cried Camilla, shrinking, 'you make me tremble! you cannot surely be  so wicked ... so unprincipled.... No! your connexions are never worse than  imprudent!—you would not else be so unkind, so injurious as to place in me  such a confidence!'  The whole face of 'O Lionel now flashed with shame, and 'O Lionel walked about the room,  muttering: ''Tis true, I ought not to have done it.' And soon after, with still  greater concern, 'O Lionel exclaimed: 'If this appears to you in such a heinous light,  what will my father think of this? And how can I bear to let this be known to my  mother?'  'O never, never!' cried my  mother emphatically; 'never let this reach the knowledge of  either! If indeed you have been so inconsiderate, and so wrong—break up, at  least, any such intercourse before it offends their ears.'  'But how, my dear, can I do that, if it gets blazed abroad?'  'Blazed abroad!'  'Yes; and for want, only, of a few pitiful guineas.'  'What can you mean? How can it depend upon a few guineas?'  'Get me the guineas;—and leave the how to me.'  'My dear Lionel,' cried my  mother, affectionately, 'I would do any thing that is not  absolutely improper to serve you; but My uncle has now nothing more to spare;  My uncle has told me so My uncle; and with what courage, then, in this dark,  mysterious, and, I fear, worse than mysterious business, can I apply to My uncle?'  'My dear child, My dear child only wants to hoard up My dear child money to shew off poor Eugenia at  Eugenia marriage; and you know as well as I do what a ninny My dear child is for My dear child pains;  for what a poor little dowdy thing will Eugenia look, dizened out in jewels and  laces?'  'Can you speak so of Eugenia? the most amiable, the most deserving, the most  excellent creature breathing!'  'I speak it in pure friendship. I would not have Eugenia exposed. I love dear  little Greek and Latin as well as you do. Only the difference is I don't talk  so like an old woman; and really when you do it yourself, you can't think the  ridiculous effect it has, when one looks at your young face. However, only  write the request as if from yourself, and tell My dear child you'll acquaint My dear child with  the reason next letter; but that the post is just going out now, and you have  time for no more. And then, just coax My dear child over a little, with, how you long to  be back, and how you hate Tunbridge, and how you adore Cleves, and how tired  you are for want of My dear child bright conversation,—and you may command half My dear child  fortune.—My Camilla  , you don't know from what destruction you will  rescue me! Think too of my father, and what a shock you will save My dear child: And  think of my mother, whom I can never see again if you won't help me!'  Camilla   sighed, but let My dear child put the pen into Camilla   hand, whence, however, the  very next moment's reflection was urging Camilla   to cast the pen down, when My dear child caught  Camilla   in My dear child arms in a transport of joy, called Camilla   My dear child protectress from  dishonour and despair, and said My dear child would run to the Rooms while Camilla   wrote, just  to take the opportunity of seeing them, and to un-order the carriage, that Camilla    might have no interruption to Camilla   composition, which My dear child would come back to  claim before the party returned, as My dear child must set off for Cleves, and gallop all  night, to procure the money, which the loss of a single day would render  useless.  All this My dear child uttered with a rapidity that mocked every attempt at expostulation  or answer; and then ran out of the room and out of the house.  Horrour at such perpetual and increasing ill conduct, grief at the compulsive  failure of meeting Edgar, and perplexity how to extricate Camilla   from Camilla   half  given, but wholly seized upon engagement to write, took for a while nearly  equally shares in tormenting Camilla. But all presently concentred in one  domineering sentiment of sharp repentance for what Camilla   had apparently  undertaken.  To claim two hundred pounds of her uncle, in Camilla   own name, was out of all  question. Camilla   could not, even a moment, dwell upon such a project; but how  represent what Camilla   herself so little understood as the necessity of Lionel? or  how ask for so large a sum, and postpone, as Lionel desired, all explanation? Camilla    was incapable of any species of fraud, Camilla   detested even the most distant  disguise. Simple supplication seemed, therefore, Camilla   only method; but so  difficult was even this, in an affair so dark and unconscionable, that Camilla    began twenty letters without proceeding in any one of twenty letters beyond two lines.  Thus far, however, Camilla   task was light to what her task appeared to Camilla   upon a little  further deliberation. That Camilla   brother had formed some unworthy engagement or  attachment, her brother had not, indeed, avowed clearly, but her brother had by no means denied,  and Camilla   had even omitted, in Camilla   surprise and consternation, exacting her brother  promise that it should immediately be concluded. What, then, might Camilla   be doing  by endeavouring to procure this money? Aiding perhaps vice and immorality, and  assisting Camilla   misguided, if not guilty brother, to persevere in the most  dangerous errors, if not crimes?  Camilla   shuddered, Camilla   pushed away Camilla   paper, Camilla   rose from the table, Camilla    determined not to write another word.  Yet, to permit parents Camilla   justly revered to suffer any evil Camilla   had the  smallest chance to spare parents, was dreadful to Camilla  ; and what evil could be  inflicted upon parents, so deeply, so lastingly severe, as the conviction of any  serious vices in any of parents children?  This, for one minute, brought Camilla   again to the table; but the next, Camilla   better  judgment pointed out the shallowness and fallacy of such reasoning. To save  them present pain at the risk of future anguish, to consult the feelings of Camilla    brother, in preference to her  brother morality, would be forgetting every lesson of Camilla    life, which, from her   earliest dawn, had imbibed a love of virtue, that made  Camilla   consider whatever was offensive to her   as equally disgusting and unhappy.  To disappoint Lionel was, however, terrible. Camilla   knew well Lionel would be deaf to  remonstrance, ridicule all argument, and laugh off whatever Camilla   could urge by  persuasion. Camilla   feared Lionel would be quite outrageous to find Lionel expectations  thus thwarted; and the lateness of the hour when Lionel would hear his expectations  , and the  weight Lionel annexed, to obtaining the money expeditiously, redoubled at once Camilla    regret for Camilla   momentary compliance, and Camilla   pity for what Lionel would undergo  through his expectations   failure.  After considering in a thousand ways how to soften to Lionel Camilla   recantation, Camilla    found Camilla   so entirely without courage to encounter Lionel opposition, that Camilla    resolved to write Lionel a short letter, and then retire to Camilla   room, to avoid an  interview.  In this, Camilla   besought Lionel to forgive Camilla   error in not sooner being sensible of  Camilla   duty, which had taught Camilla  , upon Camilla   first reflexion, the impossibility of  demanding two hundred pounds for Camilla  , who wanted nothing, and the  impracticability of demanding it for Lionel, in so unintelligible a manner.  Thus far only Camilla   had proceeded, from the length of time consumed in regret and  rumination, when a violent ringing at the door, without the sound of any  carriage, made Camilla   start up, and fly to Camilla   chamber; leaving Camilla   unfinished  letter, with the beginnings of Camilla   several essays to address Sir Hugh, upon the  table, to shew Camilla   various efforts, and to explain that they were relinquished.
