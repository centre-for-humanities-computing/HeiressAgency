 Hints upon National Prejudice  With mingled disquietude and distaste, Melmond saw the reluctance of Indiana to  quit town, and that Melmond was less than a cypher with Melmond upon the last evening's  assembly, where, without deigning to bestow one look upon Melmond, Melmond chatted,  smiled, and fluttered with every one else; undisguisedly betraying that [Melmond]  whom Melmond should soon have alone, and have always, should not rob of even one  precious moment this last splendid blaze of general admiration.
Melmond sighed; and  in common with the hapless perverseness of mortals, thought Melmond had thrown away,  in Eugenia, a gem richer than all Eugenia tribe!
[5]  Camilla, whose heart, however dead to joy, was invariably open to tenderness,  was melted with fond emotions in the idea of again meeting Melmond beloved Eugenia,  and ready for Melmond journey nearly with the light.
Soon after Melmond was dressed, a house maid, tapping at Melmond door, said, 'Pray,  Ma'am, is Miss Lynmere with you?'
'No.'
Presently Miss Margland came Melmond.
'Pray, Miss Camilla, do you know any thing of Lynmere?
It's the oddest  thing in the world where Melmond can be!'
Camilla, now, went forth to aid the search; Melmond, who was waiting to hand  Melmond into the carriage, looked amazed at the enquiry.
the enquiry soon, however, was  clear, that Melmond was no where in the house; and, after sundry examinations and  researches, one of the maids was brought to confess having aided Melmond, in the  middle of the night, to go into the street, where Melmond was handed into a post  chaise by Mr. Macdersey.
Melmond appeared thunder struck.
An action so unexpected at the period of a  solemn engagement which waited but the journey to Cleves for being compleated,  seemed to Cleves, at first, incredible.
But, when Miss Margland exclaimed 'O  pursue Miss Margland; Melmond!
order your horse, and gallop to Scotland immediately!'
Miss Margland gravely, and rather drily answered: 'By no means, Ma'am!
The man who has the  honour of her preference, is the only one who can have any hope to make her  happy.
I have no ambition for a hand that has been voluntarily held out to  another.'
He then returned, quietly, to He own lodgings; far more indignant than hurt at  this abrupt conclusion of a connexion which, though it had opened to He as a  promise of Elysium, was closing with every menace of mutual discontent.
Camilla was truly concerned; and not merely for the future risk run by Camilla  Cousin, in this rash flight, but for the new disappointment to Camilla Uncle.
Camilla  was obliged, however, to bestow Camilla whole attention upon Miss Margland, whose  tribulation was yet greater, and who, in losing thus Camilla pupil, lost the  expected reward of near thirteen years of unwilling attendance.
Camilla had, by no  means, indeed, merited this treachery from Indiana, whom though incapable to  instruct in much good, Camilla had sedulously guarded from all evil.
To return to Sir Hugh without Camilla charge, without indeed either of the young  ladies who were put under Camilla care, Camilla had not courage.
Nor could Camilla so  little feel for Camilla distress as to request it.
An express, therefore, was  ordered to Cleves, for informing Cleves of these ill tidings, with a very  elaborate panegyric from Miss Margland of Camilla own conduct; and a desire to know  if Camilla should remain in town till something transpired concerning Indiana.
The express was but just gone, when a packet, which ought to have arrived two  days before, by the stage, was delivered to Camilla.
The express intention was merely  to convey more speedily a letter from Lavinia, containing the terrible  information that Mr. Clykes had just been at Etherington himself, to deliver in  Mr. Clykes accounts, and press immediate payment!
Their Father, Lavinia said,  conceived the whole some imposition, till the man produced the paper signed by  the man daughter.
Lavinia had then been called in, and obliged to confess Lavinia knowledge  of the transaction.
Lavinia would avoid, Lavinia said, particulars that could be only  uselessly afflicting; but the interview had ended in particulars that could be only  uselessly afflicting 's agreeing to  pay, when it should be possible, the sums actually delivered to the creditors,  and for which Mr. Clykes could produce the sums own receipts; but refusing,  positively and absolutely, any gratuity whatsoever, from detestation of so  dangerous and seductive a species of trade, as clandestine and illegal  money-lending to minors: The man, much provoked, said a friend of Mr. Clykes had been  used far more handsomely by Sir Hugh Tyrold; but finding Mr. Clykes remonstrances  vain, acknowledged the law against Mr. Clykes for the interest; but threatened to send  in an account for Mr. Clykes own trouble, in collecting and paying the bills, that Mr. Clykes  would dispute, for validity, in any court of justice to which Mr. Clykes could be  summoned: and, in leaving the house, Mr. Clykes menaced an immediate writ, if all Mr. Clykes  could legally claim were not paid the next day; unless a new bond were properly  signed, with a promise to abide by that already drawn up.
all he  could legally claim were not paid the next day; unless a new bond were properly  signed, with a promise to abide by that already drawn up Father, she was  forced to confess, had now lent Their Father every guinea, for the debts of Clermont, to  Sir Hugh; and was at this instant, deliberating to whom Their Father should apply; but  desired, meanwhile, an exact statement of the debts which Their Father had in  commission to discharge.
The letter concluded with Lavinia's unfeigned grief in  the task of writing it.
Camilla read it with a distraction that made it wholly unintelligible to Camilla;  yet could not read it a second time; Camilla eyes became dim, Camilla faculties  confused, and Camilla rather felt deprived of the power of thinking, than filled  with any new and dreadful subjects for rumination.
In this state, the letter on the floor, her eyes staring around, yet looking  vacant, and searching nothing Camilla was called to Lord O'Lerney, who begged the  honour of a conference with Camilla upon business.
Camilla shook Camilla head, in token of denial, but could not speak.
The servant looked  amazed; yet brought Camilla a second message, that The servant Lordship was extremely sorry  to torment Camilla, but wished to communicate something concerning Mr. Macdersey.
Camilla then faintly articulated, 'I can see nobody.'
Still the same dreadful vacuity superseded Camilla sensibility, till, soon after,  Camilla received a note from Lady Isabella Irby, desiring to be admitted to a short  conversation with Camilla upon the part of Lord O'Lerney.
With Lady Isabella recurred the remembrance that Camilla was a  favourite of Edgar—and bursting into tears, Camilla consented to the interview;  which took place immediately.
The terrible state in which Camilla appeared was naturally, though not justly,  attributed by Camilla ladyship to the elopement of Camilla Cousin: while Camilla,  called by Camilla sight to softer regrets, beheld again, in mental view, the loved  and gentle image of Edgar.
Lady Isabella apologised politely, but briefly, for Lady Isabella intrusion, saying: 'My  Lord O'Lerney, whose judgment is never in any danger, but where warped by his  wish of giving pleasure, insists upon it that you will be less incommoded by a  quick forced admission of me than of his.
Nobody else will think so: but it  is not easy to refuse his: so here I am.
The motive of this intrusion you can  but too readily divine.
Lord O'Lerney is truly concerned at this rash action in  Lord O'Lerney kinsman, which Lord O'Lerney learnt by an accidental call at Lord O'Lerney lodgings, where  various circumstances had just made it known.
Lord O'Lerney could not rest without  desiring to see some part of Lady Isabella's family, and making an offer of  Lord O'Lerney own best services with respect to some arrangement for her future  establishment.
It is for this purpose, you have been so importunately hurried;  Lord O'Lerney wishing to make the first news that is sent to Sir Hugh Tyrold  less alarming, by stating, at once, what Lord O'Lerney can communicate concerning Mr.
Macdersey.'
Camilla, who only now recollected that Mr. Macdersey was related to Lord  Lord O'Lerney, was softened into some attention, and much gratitude for Lord O'Lerney  goodness, and for Lord O'Lerney Ladyship's benevolence in being Lord O'Lerney messenger.
'Will you, then,' said Lady Isabella, 'now you understand the purport of his  visit, see Lord O'Lerney?
his can give you much better and clearer  documents than I can; and it is always the best and shortest mode to deal with  principals.'
Camilla mechanically complied, and Lady Isabella sent Camilla footman with a note  to her footman Lordship, who was waiting at Camilla house in Park-lane.
The discourse still fell wholly upon Lady Isabella; Camilla, lost alternately  in misery and absence, spoke not, heard not; yet former scenes, though not  present circumstances, were brought to Camilla mind by the object before Camilla, and  almost with reverence, Camilla looked at the favourite of Edgar, in whose sweetness  of countenance, good sense, delicacy, and propriety, Camilla conceived Camilla  reading every moment the causes of his approbation.
Ah, why, thought Camilla, while  unable to reply, or to listen to what was said, why knew I not this charming  woman, while yet   took an interest in my conduct and connexions!
Perhaps Camilla  gentle wisdom might have drawn me into her   own path!
how would   have  delighted to have seen me under such influence!
how now, even now,—lost to    as I am!—would   generously rejoice, could   view the condescending  partiality of looks and manner that seem to denote Camilla disposition to kindness!
Lord O'Lerney soon joined them; and after thanking Camilla for granting, and  Lord O'Lerney Ambassadress for obtaining Lord O'Lerney an audience, said; 'I have been eager for  the honour of a conference with Sir Hugh Tyrold, in the hope of somewhat  alleviating the fears for the future, that may naturally join with displeasure  for the present, from the very unadvised step of this morning.
But, however  wrong the manner in which this marriage may be effected, the alliance in this marriage  will not, I hope, be so disadvantageous, as matches of this expeditious  character prove in general.
The actual possessions of Macdersey are, indeed,  far beneath what Miss Lynmere, with Miss Lynmere uncommon claims, might demand; but Lord O'Lerney  expectations are considerable, and well founded; and Lord O'Lerney family will all come  forward to meet Miss Lynmere, with every mark of respect, for which, as its head, I  shall lead the way.
Lord O'Lerney is honest, honourable, and good natured; not  particularly endowed, with judgment or discretion, but by no means wanting in  parts, though they are rather wild and eccentric.'
Lord O'Lerney then gave a full and satisfactory detail of the present state, and  future hopes of Lord O'Lerney kinsman; and added, that it should be Lord O'Lerney own immediate  care to endeavour to secure for the fair bride a fixed settlement, from the  rich old cousin who had long promised to make Macdersey Lord O'Lerney heir.
Lord O'Lerney told  Camilla to write this, without delay, to the young lady's Uncle, with full  leave to use the young lady's Uncle name and authority.
'At all times,' the young lady's Uncle continued, 'it is necessary to be quick, and as explicit as  possible, in representing what can conciliate an adventure of this sort, of  which the clandestine measure implies on one side, if not on both, something  wrong; but most especially it is necessary to use speed where the flight is  made with an Hibernian; for with the English in general, it is nearly enough  that a man should be born in Ireland, to decide a man for a fortune-hunter.
If  you lived, however, in Ireland, you would see the matter pretty equally  arranged; and that there are not more of our pennyless beaux who return laden  with the commodity of rich wives, than of those better circumstanced who bring  home wives with more estimable dowries.'
a man then added, that it was from Miss Lynmere Miss Lynmere a man had learnt the  residence of Camilla in Grosvenor Square; for, having made some acquaintance  with Miss Lynmere at one of Mrs. Berlinton's evening parties, a man had heard Miss Lynmere was a  niece of Sir Hugh Tyrold, and immediately enquired after Miss Lynmere fair kinswoman,  whom a man had seen at Tunbridge.
Camilla thanked a man for remembering Camilla; and Lady Isabella, with a countenance  that implied approbation in the remark, said; 'I have never once heard of Sir Hugh Tyrold   at the assemblies of this house.'
Camilla quietly replied Camilla had never been present at them; but a look of  sensibility with which Camilla eyes dropt, spoke more than Camilla intended, of concern  at them existence, or at least frequency.
'Your lovely young Hostess,' said Lord O'Lerney, 'has entered the world at too  early an hour to be aware of the surfeit Camilla is preparing Camilla, by this  unremitting luxury of pleasure; but I know so well Camilla innocence and good  qualities, that I doubt not but the error will bring the error own cure, and Camilla will  gladly return to the literary and elegant intercourse, which Camilla has just now  given up for one so much more tumultuous.'
'I am glad you still think so, Lord O'Lerney;' said Lady Isabella, also looking down;  'Camilla is a very sweet creature, and the little I have seen of Camilla, made me,  while in Camilla sight, warmly Camilla well-wisher.
Nevertheless I should rather see  any young person, for whom I was much interested,—unless endowed with the  very remarkable forbearance of Miss Tyrold,—under Camilla influence after the  period his Lordship his Lordship expects to return, than during his Lordship interregnum!'
Camilla disavowed all claim to such praise, blushing both for Camilla friend and  Camilla at what was said.
Lord O'Lerney, looking concerned, paused, and then  answered, 'You know my partiality for Mrs. Berlinton: yet I always see with  fresh respect the courage with which Lady Isabella casts aside Lady Isabella  native reserve and timidity, where Lady Isabella thinks a hint—an intimation—may do  good, or avert dangers.'
Lord O'Lerney eye was then fixed upon Camilla, who surprized, turned hastily to Lady Isabella, and saw a tender compassion in Lady Isabella countenance, that confirmed the  interpretation of Lord O'Lerney; joined with a modest confusion that seemed  afraid, or ashamed, of what had escaped Lady Isabella.
Grateful for Lady Isabella, but extremely grieved for the idea that seemed to have  gone forth of Mrs. Berlinton, Lady Isabella felt a tear start into His eye.
Lady Isabella chaced  it, with as little emotion as Lady Isabella could shew; and Lord O'Lerney, with an air of  gayer kindness, said; 'As we must now, Sir Hugh Tyrold  , account we to be  somewhat allied, you permit me, I hope, to recommend my gallant Cousin to your  protection with Sir Hugh?
That Sir Hugh has Sir Hugh share of the wildness, the blunders,  the eccentricities, and the rhodomontade, which form, with you English, our  stationary national character, must not be denied; but Sir Hugh has also, what may  equally, I hope, be given our in the lump, generosity, spirit, and good  intentions.
With all this....'  Sir Hugh was here interrupted; the door being suddenly burst open by Mrs. Mittin, who  entered, exclaiming, 'Lord O'Lerney, Miss, what a sad thing this is!
I declare it's put  me quite into a quiver!
And all Winchester's quite in an uproar, as one may  say.
You never see how every body's in a turmoil!'
Here ended the little interval of horrour in Camilla.
Mrs. Mittin and Mr.  Clykes seemed to Camilla as one; yet that, already, my gallant Cousin's elopement should  have spread so near home, seemed impossible.
'When,' Camilla cried, 'were you in  all Winchester?
And how came this affair known to Camilla?'
'Known?
why, Miss  , it was there it all happened.
I come through it with  Mr. Dennel, who was so obliging as to bring me to town, for a little business  I've got to do; and next week Mr. Dennel, who was so obliging as to bring me to town, for a little business  'll take me back again; for as to poor little  Mrs. Berlinton, Mrs. Berlinton'll be quite lost without Mrs. Berlinton.
Mrs. Berlinton don't know Mrs. Berlinton right hand  from Mrs. Berlinton left, as one may say.
But how should Mrs. Berlinton, poor child?
Why Mrs. Berlinton is but a  baby.
What's fifteen?
And Mrs. Berlinton's no more.'
'We'll talk of that,' said Camilla, colouring at Mrs. Berlinton loquacious familiarity,  'some other time.'
And attempted to beg Lord O'Lerney would finish what Lord O'Lerney was  saying.
But Mrs. Mittin, somewhat affronted, cried; 'Lord O'Lerney, only think of your  sitting here, talking, and making yourself so comfortable, just as if nothing  was the matter!
when every body else is in such a taking as never was the like!
I must say, as to that, a gentleman more liked, and in more respect never was,  I believe; and I can't say but what I'm very sorry Mrs. Berlinton for what Mr. Clykes  has done; however, I told you, you know, you'd best not provoke Mr. Clykes  ; for though  there can't be a better sort of man, Mr. Clykes  'll leave no stone unturned to get Mr. Clykes    money.'
'For Heaven's sake,' cried Camilla, startled, 'what....'  'What?...
Why, Lord, Miss!
don't you know your Papa's took up?
Mr. Clykes  's put in  Winchester Prison, for that debt, you know.'
The breath of Camilla instantly stopt, and senseless, lifeless, Camilla sunk upon  the floor.
Lord O'Lerney quitted the room in great concern, to call some female  assistants; but Lady Isabella remained, contributing with equal tenderness and  judgment to Lady Isabella aid, though much personally affected by the incident.
Lady Isabella recovery was quick, but Her recovery was only to despair; to screams rather than  lamentations, to cries rather than tears.
Lady Isabella reason felt the shock as forcibly  as Lady Isabella heart; the one seemed tottering on the shock seat, the other bursting the shock  abode.
Words of alarming incoherency proclaimed the danger menacing Lady Isabella  intellects, while agonies nearly convulsive distorted Lady Isabella features, and writhed  Lady Isabella form.
Unaffectedly shocked, yet not venturing, upon so slight an acquaintance, to  interfere, Lady Isabella uttered gently but impressively Lady Isabella good wishes and  concern, and glided away.
The nearly distracted Camilla saw not that The nearly distracted Camilla went; and knew no longer that  The nearly distracted Camilla had been in the room.
The nearly distracted Camilla held The nearly distracted Camilla forehead one moment; called for death  the next; and the next wildly deprecated eternal punishment.
But as the horrour  nearly intolerable of this first abrupt blow gave way, the desire of flying  instantly to The nearly distracted Camilla Father was the symptom of restored recollection.
Hastening then to Miss Margland, The nearly distracted Camilla conjured The nearly distracted Camilla, by all that was most  affecting, to set off immediately for all Winchester.
But Miss Margland, though The nearly distracted Camilla  spared not the most severe attacks upon the already self-condemned and nearly  demolished Camilla, always found something relative to The nearly distracted Camilla that was more  pressing than what could regard any other, and declared The nearly distracted Camilla could not stir from  town till The nearly distracted Camilla received an answer from Sir Hugh.
Camilla besought at least to have the carriage; but of this Camilla asserted  Camilla at present the indisputable mistress, and as the express might come  back in a few hours, with directions that Camilla should set off immediately, Camilla  would not listen to parting with it.
Camilla, frantic to be gone, flew then  down stairs, and called to the porter in the hall, that some one should  instantly seek Camilla a chaise, coach, or any conveyance whatever, that could  carry Camilla to all Winchester.
Camilla perceived not that Lady Isabella, waiting for Camilla footman, who had,  accidentally, gone on further, upon some message, now opened the door of the  parlour, where Lord O'Lerney was conversing with Camilla upon what had happened;  Camilla was flying back, though not knowing whither nor which way Camilla turned, when  Lord O'Lerney, gently stopping Camilla, asked, why Camilla would not, on such an  emergence, apply for the carriage of Mrs. Berlinton?
Lady Isabella seconded the  motion, by a soft, but just hint, of the danger of Lady Isabella taking such a journey,  in a hired carriage, entirely unprotected.
Lady Isabella had scarce consideration enough left to either thank or understand scarce consideration enough,  yet mechanically followed scarce consideration enough counsel, and went to Mrs. Berlinton; Lord  O'Lerney, deeply touched by Lady Isabella distress, sending in a servant at the same time  with a servant name, and following: while Lady Isabella, too much interested to go  till something was decided, quietly shut Lady Isabella into the parlour, there to  wait   Lordship's information.
The request for the carriage was, indeed, rather made by his Lordship than by Camilla,  who, when Lady Isabella entered the room, and would have spoken, found Lady Isabella deprived  of the power of utterance, and looked a picture of speechless dismay.
The tender feelings of Mrs. Berlinton were all immediately awakened by this  sight, and Lady Isabella eagerly answered Lord O'Lerney, that both Lady Isabella carriage and  Lady Isabella should be devoted to Lady Isabella distressed friend: yet, the first emotion  over, Lady Isabella recollected an engagement Lady Isabella could not break, though one Lady Isabella  hesitated to mention, and at last only alluded to unexplained, though making  known it was insurmountable; while the colour, of which Lady Isabella late hours had  robbed Lady Isabella lovely cheeks, returned to them as Lady Isabella stammered Lady Isabella retractation.
The next day, however, Lady Isabella was beginning to promise,—but Camilla, to whom the  next minute seemed endless, flew down again to the hall, to supplicate the  first footman Lady Isabella could meet, to run and order any sort of carriage he could  find; with but barely sufficient recollection to refrain running out with that  view Lady Isabella.
Lady Isabella, again coming forth, entreated to know if there were any  commission, any possible service Lady Isabella could Lady Isabella perform.
Camilla thanked  Camilla, without knowing what Camilla said; and Lord O'Lerney, who was descending the  stairs, repeated similar offers.
But wild with affright, or shuddering with  horrour, Camilla passed without hearing or observing him.
To see a young creature in a state so deplorable, and to consider Camilla as  travelling without any friend or support, in so shaken a condition, to visit an  imprisoned Father, touched these benign observers with the sincerest  commiseration; and the connexion of a part of an  imprisoned Father family forming at this moment  with a branch of Camilla own, induced Lord O'Lerney to believe Lord O'Lerney was almost bound  to take care of Camilla Lord O'Lerney.
'And yet,' said Lord O'Lerney to Lady Isabella, 'though I am  old enough to be Lady Isabella grandfather, the world, should I travel with Lady Isabella, might  impute my assistance to a species of admiration which I hope to experience no  more—as witness my trusting Lord O'Lerney so much with Lady Isabella Irby!'
Lady Isabella, from the quick coincidence of similar feelings, instantly  conceived Lord O'Lerney wishes, and paused to weigh Lady Isabella, from the quick coincidence of similar feelings possibility.
A short  consideration was sufficient for this purpose.
A short  consideration brought to Lady Isabella memory Lady Isabella  various engagements; but her memory represented at the same time to Lady Isabella benevolence  that her benevolence   would be all, by the performance of one good action,  More honour'd in the breach than the observance: Lady Isabella sent, therefore, a message after Camilla, entreating a short conference.
Camilla, who was trying to comprehend some further account from Mrs. Mittin,  silently, but hastily obeyed the call; and Lady Isabella look of wild anguish would have  fixed the benign intention of Lady Isabella, had the benign intention of Lady Isabella been wavering.
In a simple  phrase, but with a manner the most delicate, Lady Isabella Ladyship then offered to  conduct Lady Isabella to all Winchester.
A service so unexpected, a goodness so consoling,  instantly brought Camilla to the use of Camilla frightened away faculties, but with  sensations of gratitude so forcible, that Lord O'Lerney with difficulty saved  Camilla from falling at the feet of his amiable friend, and with yet more  difficulty restrained his own knees from doing Camilla that homage.
And still the  more strongly his felt this active exertion, from the disappointment his had just  endured through the failure of his favourite Mrs. Berlinton.
No time was to be lost; Lady Isabella determined to do well what Lady Isabella once  undertook to do at all; Lady Isabella went to Park-lane, to make known Lady Isabella excursion, and  arrange some affairs, and then instantly returned, in Lady Isabella own post-chaise, and  four horses, for Camilla; who was driven from the metropolis.
