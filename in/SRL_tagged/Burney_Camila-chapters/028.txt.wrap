 An Author's Idea of Order  Not a bosom of the Cleves party enjoyed much tranquillity this evening. Miss  Margland, though to the Baronet she would not recede from her first assertions,  strove vainly to palliate to herself the ill grace and evident dissatisfaction  with which Edgar had met the report. To save her own credit, however, was  always her primary consideration; she resolved, therefore, to cast upon unfair  play in Camilla, or upon the instability of Edgar, all the blame really due to  her own undiscerning self-sufficiency.  Indiana thought so little for herself, that she adopted, of course, every  opinion of Miss Margland; yet the immoveable coldness of Edgar, contrasted  frequently in her remembrance by the fervour of Melmond and of Macdersey,  became more and more distasteful to her; and Mrs. Arlbery's idea, that she  should be locked up in half a year, made her look upon him alternately as  something to shun or to over-reach. She even wished to refuse him:—but Beech  Park, the equipage, the servants, the bridal habiliment.—No! she could enjoy  those, if not him. And neither her own feelings, nor the lessons of Miss  Margland, had taught her to look upon marriage in any nobler point of view.  But the person most deeply dissatisfied this evening was Edgar. He now saw  that, deceived by his own consciousness, he had misunderstood Mrs. Needham,  who, as well as Mrs. Arlbery, he was convinced concluded him engaged to  Indiana. He had observed with concern the approving credulity of Sir Hugh, and  though glad to find his real plan, and all his wishes unsuspected, the false  report excited his fears, lest Indiana should give it any credit, and secretly  hurt his delicacy for the honour of his taste.  All the influence of pecuniary motives to which he deemed Camilla superior,  occurred to him in the very words of Dr. Marchmont for Indiana; whose capacity  he saw was as shallow as her person was beautiful. Yet the admiration with  which she had already made her first appearance in the world, might naturally  induce her belief of his reported devotion. If, therefore, his situation  appeared to her to be eligible, she had probably settled to accept him.  The most timid female delicacy was not more scrupulous, than the manly honour  of Edgar to avoid this species of misapprehension; and though perfectly  confident his behaviour had been as irreproachable as it was undesigning, the  least idea of any self-delusion on the part of Indiana, seemed a call upon his  integrity for the most unequivocal manifestation of his intentions. Yet any  declaration by words, with whatever care selected, might be construed into an  implication that he concluded the decision in his own hands. And though he  could scarcely doubt the fact, he justly held nothing so offensive as the  palpable presumption. One only line of conduct appeared to him, therefore,  unexceptionable; which was wholly to avoid her, till the rumour sunk into its  own nothingness.  This demanded from him a sacrifice the most painful, that of retiring from  Cleves in utter ignorance of the sentiments of Camilla; yet it seemed the more  necessary, since he now, with much uneasiness, recollected many circumstances  which his absorbed mind had hitherto suffered to pass unnoticed, that led him  to fear Sir Hugh himself, and the whole party, entertained the same notion.  He was shocked to consider Camilla involved in such a deception, though  delighted by the idea he might perhaps owe to an explanation, some marks of  that preference for which Dr. Marchmont had taught him to wait, and which he  now hoped might lie dormant from the persuasion of his engagement. To clear  this mistake was, therefore, every way essential, as otherwise the very purity  of her character must be in his disfavour.  Still, however, the visit to the Grove hung upon his mind, and he resolved to  investigate its cause the following morning, before he made his retreat.  Early the next day, Camilla sent to hasten the chaise which was to fetch Mr.  Tyrold, and begged leave of her uncle to breakfast at Etherington. His assent  was always ready; and believing every evil would yield to absence, she eagerly,  and even with happiness set off.  When the rest of the party assembled without her, Edgar, surprised, enquired if  she were well? Miss Margland answered yes; but for the sake of what she loved  best in the world, a frolic, she was gone in the chaise to Etherington. Edgar  could not prevail with himself to depart till he had spoken with her, and  privately deferred his purposed leave-taking till noon.  During this report, Sir Hugh was anxiously engaged in some business he seemed  to wish to conceal. He spoke little, but nodded frequently to himself, with an  air of approving his own ideas; he summoned Jacob to him repeatedly, with whom  he held various whispering conferences; and desired Miss Margland, who made the  tea, not to pour it out too fast, as he was in no hurry to have breakfast over.  When nothing he could urge succeeded, in making any of the company eat or drink  any thing more, he pulled Edgar by the sleeve; and, in an eager but low voice,  said, 'My dear Mr. Edgar, I have a great favour to beg of you, which is only  that you will do something to divert Dr. Orkborne.'  'I should be very happy, Sir,' cried Edgar, smiling, 'but I much doubt my  capability.'  'Why, my dear Mr. Edgar, it's only to keep him from finding out my new surprise  till it's got ready. And if you will but just spout out to him a bit or two of  Virgil and Horace, or some of those Greek and Latin language-masters, he'll be  in no hurry to budge, I promise you.'  A request from Sir Hugh, who with the most prompt alacrity met the wishes of  everyone, was by Edgar held to be indisputable. He advanced, therefore, to Dr.  Orkborne, who was feeling for his tablets, which he commonly examined in his  way up the stairs, and started a doubt, of which he begged an exposition, upon  a passage of Virgil.  Dr. Orkborne willingly stopt, and displayed, with no small satisfaction, an  erudition, that did him nearly as much honour in the ears of the ignorant and  admiring Sir Hugh, as in those of the cultivated and well-judging Edgar. 'Ah!'  said the Baronet, sighing, though addressing himself to no one, 'if I had but  addicted myself to these studies in due season, I might have understood all  this too! though now I can't for my life make out much sense of what they're  talking of; nor a little neither, indeed, as to that; thanks to my own  idleness; to which, however, I am not much obliged.'  Unfortunately, the discussion soon led to some points of comparison, that  demanded a review of various authors, and the doctor proposed adjourning to his  own apartment. The Baronet winked at Edgar, who would have changed the  discourse, or himself have sought the books, or have been satisfied without  them; but Dr. Orkborne was as eager here, as in other matters he was slow and  phlegmatic; and, regardless of all opposition, was making off, when Sir Hugh,  catching him by the arm, exclaimed, 'My good friend, I beg it as a particular  favour, you won't stir a step!'  'Not stir a step, Sir?' repeated the doctor, amazed.  'That is, not to your own room.'  'Not go to my own room, Sir?'  The Baronet gently begged him not to take it amiss, and presently, upon the  appearance of Jacob, who entered with a significant smile, said, he would keep  him no longer.  Dr. Orkborne, to whom nothing was so irksome as a moment's detention from his  books and papers, instantly departed, inviting Edgar to accompany him; but  without troubling himself to inquire for what end he had been held back.  When they were gone, Sir Hugh, rubbing his hands, said, 'Well, I think this  good gentleman won't go about the country again, with all his books fastened  about him, to shew he has nowhere to put them: for as to his telling me he only  took them to look at, I am not quite such an ignoramus, with all my ignorance,  as to believe such a thing as that, especially of a regular bred scholar.'  A loud and angry sound of voices from above here interrupted the pleased  harangue of the Baronet; Miss Margland opened the door to listen, and, with no  small delight, heard words, scarce intelligible for rage, breaking from Dr.  Orkborne, whose anger, while Edgar was endeavouring to moderate, Jacob and Mary  were vociferously resenting.  Sir Hugh, all astonished, feared there was some mistake. He had sent, the  preceding day, as far as Winchester, for two bookcases, which he had ordered  should arrive early, and be put up during the breakfast; and he had directed  Mary to place upon the shelves, with great care, all the loose books and papers  she found dispersed about the room, as neatly as possible: after which Jacob  was to give notice when all was arranged.  The words now 'If I must have my manuscripts rummaged at pleasure, by every  dunce in the house, I would rather lie in the street!' distinctly caught their  ears. Sir Hugh was thunderstruck with amazement and disappointment, but said  nothing. Miss Margland looked all spite and pleasure, and Eugenia all concern.  Louder yet, and with accents of encreasing asperity, the Doctor next exclaimed  'A twelvemonth's hard labour will not repair this mischief! I should have been  much more obliged to you if you had blown out my brains!'  The Baronet, aghast, cried, 'Lord help us! I think I had best go and get the  shelves pulled down again, what I have done not being meant to offend, being  what will cost me ten pounds and upwards.'  He then, though somewhat irresolute, whether or not to proceed, moved towards  the foot of the stairs; but there a new storm of rage startled him. 'I wish you  had been all of you annihilated ere ever you had entered my room! I had rather  have lost my ears than that manuscript! I wish with all my heart you had been  at the bottom of the sea, every one of you, before you had touched it!'  'If you won't believe me, it can't be helped,' said Mary; 'but if I was to tell  it you over and over, I've done nothing to no mortal thing. I only just swept  the room after the carpenter was gone, for it was all in such a pickle it was a  shame to be seen.'  'You have ruined me!' cried he, 'you have swept it behind the fire, I make not  a moment's doubt; and I had rather you had given me a bowl of poison! you can  make me no reparation; it was a clue to a whole section.'  'Well, I won't make no more words about it,' said Mary, angrily; 'but I'm sure  I never so much as touched it with a pair of tongs, for I never see it; nor I  don't so much as know it if I do.'  'Why, it's a piece of paper written all over; look! just such another as this:  I left it on the table, by this corner—'  'O! that?' cried Mary; 'yes, I remember that.'  'Well, where is it? What have you done with it?'  'Why, I happened of a little accident about that;—for as I was a sweeping  under the table, the broom knocked the ink down; but, by good luck, it only  fell upon that little morsel of paper.'  'Little morsel of paper? it's more precious than a whole library! But what did  you do with it? what is become of it? whatever condition it is in, if you have  but saved it—where is it, I say?'  'Why—it was all over ink, and good for nothing, so I did not think of your  missing it—so I throwed it behind the fire.'  'I wish you had been thrown there yourself with all my heart! But if ever you  bring a broom into my room again—'  'Why, I did nothing but what my master ordered—'  'Or if ever you touch a paper, or a book of mine, again—'  'My master said himself—'  'Your master's a blockhead! and you are another—go away, I say!'  Mary now hurried out of the room, enraged for her master, and frightened for  herself; and Edgar, not aware Sir Hugh was within hearing, soon succeeded in  calming the doctor, by mildly listening to his lamentations.  Sir Hugh, extremely shocked, sat upon the stairs to recover himself. Miss  Margland, who never felt so virtuous, and never so elated, as when witnessing  the imperfections or improprieties of others, descanted largely against  ingratitude; treating an unmeaning sally of passion as a serious mark of  turpitude: but Eugenia, ashamed for Dr. Orkborne, to whom, as her preceptor,  she felt a constant disposition to be partial, determined to endeavour to  induce him to make some apology. She glided, therefore, past her uncle, and  tapped at the doctor's door.  Mary, seeing her master so invitingly in her way, could by no means resist her  desire of appeal and complaint; and, descending the stairs, begged his honour  to hear her.  'Mary,' said he, rising, and returning to the parlour, 'you need not tell me a  word, for I have heard it all myself; by which it may be truly said, listeners  never hear good of themselves; so I've got the proper punishment; for which  reason, I hope you won't look upon it as an example.'  'I am sure, Sir,' said Mary, 'if your honour can excuse his speaking so  disrespectful, it's what nobody else can; and if it was not for thinking as his  head's got a crack in it, there is not a servant among us as would not affront  him for it.'  The Baronet interrupted her with a serious lecture upon the civility he  expected for all his guests; and she promised to restrain her wrath; 'But only,  sir,' she continued, 'if your honour had seen the bit of paper as he made such  a noise at me for, your honour would not have believed it. Not a soul could  have read it. My Tom would ha' been well licked if he'd wrote no better at  school. And as to his being a twelvemonth a scrawling such another, I'll no  more believe it than I'll fly. It's as great a fib as ever was told.'  Sir Hugh begged her to be quiet, and to think no more of the matter.  'No, your honour, I hope I'm not a person as bears malice; only I could not but  speak of it, because he behaves more comical every day. I thought he'd ha' beat  me over and over. And as to the stories he tells about them little bits of  paper, mortal patience can't bear it no longer.'  The remonstrance of Eugenia took immediate effect. Dr. Orkborne, shocked and  alarmed at the expression which had escaped him, protested himself willing to  make the humblest reparation, and truly declared, he had been so greatly  disturbed by the loss he had just sustained, that he not merely did not mean,  but did not know what he had said.  Edgar was the bearer of his apology, which Sir Hugh accepted with his usual  good humour. 'His calling me a blockhead,' cried he, 'is a thing I have no  right to resent, because I take it for granted, he would not have said it, if  he had not thought it; and a man's thoughts are his castle, and ought to be  free.'  Edgar repeated the protestation, that he had been hurried on by passion, and  spoke without meaning.  'Why, then, my dear Mr. Edgar, I must fairly own I don't see the great  superiorness of learning, if it can't keep a man's temper out of a passion.  However, say nothing of the sort to poor Clermont, upon his coming over, who I  expect won't speak one word in ten I shall understand; which, however, as it's  all been done for the best, I would not have the poor boy discouraged in.'  He then sent a kind message by Edgar to Dr. Orkborne, desiring him not to mind  such a trifle.  This conciliating office was congenial to the disposition of Edgar, and  softened his impatience for the return of Camilla, but when, soon after, a note  arrived from Mr. Tyrold, requesting Sir Hugh to dispense with seeing him till  the next day, and apologising for keeping his daughter, he felt equally  disappointed and provoked, though he determined not to delay any longer his  departure. He gave orders, therefore, for his horses immediately, and with all  the less regret, for knowing Camilla no longer in the circle he was to quit.  The ladies were in the parlour with Sir Hugh, who was sorrowfully brooding over  his brother's note, when he entered it to take leave. Addressing himself  somewhat rapidly to the Baronet, he told him he was under an unpleasant  necessity, to relinquish some days of the month's sojourn intended for him. He  made acknowledgments full of regard for his kindness and hospitality; and then,  only bowing to the ladies, left the room, before the astonished Sir Hugh  comprehended he was going.  'Well,' cried Miss Margland, 'this is curious indeed! He has flown off from  everything, without even an apology!'  'I hope he is not really gone?' said Eugenia, walking to the window.  'I'm sure I don't care what he does,' cried Indiana, 'he's welcome to go or to  stay. I'm grown quite sick of him, for my part.'  'Gone?' said Sir Hugh, recovering breath; 'it's impossible! Why, he never has  said one word to me of the day, nor the settlements, nor all those things!'  He then rang the bell, and sent to desire Mr. Mandlebert might be called  immediately.  Edgar, who was mounting his horse, obeyed with some chagrin. As soon as he  re-entered the room, Sir Hugh cried; 'My dear Mr. young Edgar, it's something  amazing to me you should think of going away without coming to an explanation?'  'An explanation, sir?'  'Yes, don't you know what I mean?'  'Not in the least, sir,' cried Edgar, staggered by a doubt whether he suspected  what he felt for Camilla, or referred to what was reported of Indiana.  'Why, then, my pretty dear,' said Sir Hugh to Indiana, 'you won't object, I  hope, to taking a little walk in the garden, provided it is not disagreeable to  you; for you had better not hear what we are going to talk about before your  face.'  Indiana, pouting her beautiful under lip, and scornfully passing Edgar,  complied. Eugenia accompanied her; but Miss Margland kept her ground.  Sir Hugh, always unwilling to make any attack, and at a loss how to begin,  simply said; 'Why, I thought Mr. Mandlebert, you would stay with us till next  year?'  Edgar only bowed.  'Why, then, suppose you do?'  'Most probably, sir, I shall by that time be upon the Continent. If some  particular circumstance does not occur, I purpose shortly making the tour of  Europe.'  Sir Hugh now lost all guard and all restraint, and with undisguised displeasure  exclaimed; 'So here's just the second part of Clermont! at the moment I sent  for him home, thinking he would come to put the finish to all my cares about  Eugenia, he sends me word he must travel!—And though the poor girl took it  very well, from knowing nothing of the matter, I can't say I take it very kind  of you, Mr. young Edgar, to come and do just the same by Indiana!'  The surprize of Edgar was unspeakable: that Sir Hugh should wish the relation  of Jacob, with respect to Indiana, confirmed, he could not wonder; but that his  wishes should have amounted to expectations, and that he should deem his niece  ill used by their failure, gave him the most poignant astonishment.  Miss Margland, taking advantage of his silent consternation, began now to pour  forth very volubly, the most pointed reflections upon the injury done to young  ladies by reports of this nature, which were always sure to keep off all other  offers. There was no end, she said, to the admirers who had deserted Indiana in  despair; and she questioned if she would ever have any more, from the general  belief of her being actually pre-engaged.  Edgar, whose sense of honour was tenaciously delicate, heard her with a mixture  of concern for Indiana, and indignation against herself, that kept her long  uninterrupted; for though burning to assert the integrity of his conduct, the  fear of uttering a word that might be offensive to Indiana, embarrassed and  checked him.  Sir Hugh, who in seeing him overpowered, concluded he was relenting, now kindly  took his hand, and said: 'My dear Mr. Mandlebert, if you are sorry for what you  were intending, of going away, and leaving us all in the lurch, why, you shall  never hear a word more about it, for I will make friends for you with Indiana,  and beg of Miss Margland that she'll do us the favour to say no more.'  Edgar, affectionately pressing the hand of the Baronet, uttered the warmest  expressions of personal regard, and protested he should always think it an  honour to have been held worthy of pretending to any alliance in his family;  but he knew not how the present mistake had been made, or report had arisen: he  could boast of no partiality from Miss Lynmere, nor had he ever addressed her  with any particular views: yet, as it was the opinion of Miss Margland, that  the rumour, however false, might prevent the approach of some deserving object,  he now finally determined to become, for awhile, a stranger at Cleves, however  painful such self-denial must prove.  He then precipitately left the room, and, in five minutes, had galloped out of  the Park.  The rest of the morning was spent by Sir Hugh in the utmost discomposure; and  by Miss Margland in alternate abuse of Camilla and of Edgar; while Indiana  passed from a piqued and short disappointment, to the consolatory idea that  Melmond might now re-appear.  Edgar rode strait to Beech Park, where he busied himself the whole day in  viewing alterations and improvements; but where nothing answered his  expectations, since Camilla had disappointed them. That sun-beam, which had  gilded the place to his eyes, was now over-clouded, and the first possession of  his own domain, was his first day of discontent.
