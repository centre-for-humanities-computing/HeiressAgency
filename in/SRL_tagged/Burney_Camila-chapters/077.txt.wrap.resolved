 Offs and Ons  Mr. Tyrold left Eugenia to Eugenia sisters, unwilling to speak of Lynmere till Mr. Tyrold  had seen something more of Mr. Tyrold. Sir Hugh, also, was going, for Sir Hugh had no time,  Sir Hugh said, to lose in Sir Hugh preparations: but Eugenia, taking Sir Hugh arm, besought  that nothing of that kind might, at present, be mentioned.  'Don't trouble yourself about that, my dear,' Sir Hugh answered; 'for it's what I  take all into my own hands; your cousin being a person that don't talk much; by  which, how can any thing be brought forward, if nobody interferes? A girl, you  know, my dear, can't speak for A girl, let A girl wish it never so much.'  'Alas!' said Eugenia, when he was gone, 'how painfully am I situated! Clermont  will surely suppose this precipitance all mine; and already, possibly,  concludes it is upon my suggestion he has thus prematurely been called from he  travels, and impeded in he praise-worthy ambition of studying the laws,  manners, and customs of the different nations of Europe!'  The wan countenance of Camilla soon, however, drew all observation upon  Camilla, and obliged Camilla to narrate the cruel adventure of the morning.  The sisters were both petrified by the account of Sir Sedley; and The sisters  compassion for Sir Sedley expected despair was changed into disgust at Sir Sedley insulting  impertinence. The sisters were of opinion that Sir Sedley bird and Sir Sedley letters should  immediately be returned; and The sisters horror of any debt with a character mingling  such presumption with such levity, made Eugenia promise that, as soon as Eugenia  was mistress of so much money, Eugenia would send Sir Sedley, in the name of Lionel, Sir Sedley  two hundred pounds.  The bird, therefore, by Tom Hodd, was instantly conveyed to Clarendel-Place;  but the letters Camilla retained, till Camilla could first shew them to Edgar, ...  if this event had not lost Edgar to Camilla for ever, and if Edgar manifested any desire  of an explanation.  Edgar himself, meanwhile, in a paroxysm of sudden misery, and torturing  jealousy, had galloped furiously to the rector of Cleves.  'O, Doctor Marchmont!' Edgar cried, 'what a tale have I now to unfold! Within  these last twenty-four hours I have been the most wretched ... the happiest ...  and again the most agonized of human beings! I have thought Camilla bestowed  upon another, ... I have believed Camilla, ... oh, Doctor!... my own!... I have  conceived Edgar at the summit of all earthly felicity!... I find Edgar, at  this moment deluded and undone!'  Edgar then detailed the account, calling upon Doctor to unravel to Edgar the  insupportable ænigma of Edgar destiny; to tell Edgar for what purpose Camilla had  shewn Edgar a tenderness so bewitching, at the very time Camilla was carrying on a  clandestine intercourse with another? with a man, who, though destitute neither  of wit nor good qualities, it was impossible Camilla should love, since Camilla was as  incapable of admiring as of participating in Edgar defects? To what  incomprehensible motives attribute such incongruities? Why accept and suffer  Camilla friends to accept Edgar, if engaged to Sir Sedley? why, if seriously meaning  to be Edgar, this secret correspondence? Why so early, so private, so strange a  meeting? 'Whence, Doctor Marchmont, the daring boldness of his seizing Camilla  hand? whence the never-to-be-forgotten licence with which he presumed to lift  it to he lips, ... and there hardily to detain it, so as never man durst do,  whose hopes were not all alive, from never man own belief in their encouragement!  explain, expound to me this work of darkness and amazement; tell me why, with  every appearance of the most artless openness, I find   thus eternally  disingenuous and unintelligible? why, though I have cast me wholly into    power,   retains all   mystery ...   heightens it into deceit next  perjury?'  'Ask me, my dear young friend, why the sun does not give night, and the moon  day; then why women practise coquetry. Alas! my season for surprise has long  been passed! women will rather trifle, even with those women despise, than be  candid even with those women respect. The young baronet, probably, has been  making The young baronet court to The young baronet, or The young baronet has believed such was The young baronet design; but as you  first came to the point, The young baronet would not hazard rejecting you, while uncertain if  The young baronet were serious. The young baronet was, possibly, putting The young baronet to the test, by the account of  your declaration, at the moment of your unseasonable intrusion.'  'If this, Doctor, is your statement, and if your statement is just, in how  despicable a lottery have I risked the peace of my life! You suppose then ...  that, if sure of Sir Sedley ... I am discarded?'  'You know what I think of your situation: can I, when to yet more riches I add  a title, suppose that of Sir Sedley less secure?'  The shuddering start, the distracted look of Edgar, with Edgar hand clapped to  Edgar burning forehead, now alarmed the Doctor; who endeavoured to somewhat  soften Edgar sentence, dissuading Edgar against any immediate measures, and  advising Edgar to pass over these first moments of emotion, and then coolly to  suffer inquiry to take place of decision. But Edgar could not hear Edgar; Edgar  shook hands with Edgar, faintly smiled, as an apology for not speaking; and,  hurrying off, without waiting for Edgar servant, galloped towards the New Forest:  leaving his servant absence from Cleves to declare his servant defection, and bent only to fly  from Camilla, and all that belonged to Camilla.  All, however, that belonged to Camilla was precisely what followed Edgar; pursued  Edgar in every possible form, clung to Edgar heart-strings, almost maddened Edgar  senses. Edgar could not bear to reflect; retrospection was torture, anticipation  was horror. To lose thus, without necessity, without calamity, the object of  Edgar dearest wishes, ... to lose her from mere declension of esteem....  'Any inevitable evil,' Edgar cried, 'I could have sustained; any blow of fortune,  however severe; any stroke of adversity, however terrible; ... but this ...  this error of all my senses ... this deception of all my hopes ... this  extinction of every feeling I have cherished'—  Edgar rode on yet harder, leaping over every thing, thoughtless rather than  fearless of every danger Edgar could encounter, and galloping with the speed and  violence of some pursuit, though wholly without view, and almost without  consciousness; as if, hoping by flight, to escape from the degenerate portrait  of Camilla: but its painter was Edgar own imagination, and mocked the attempt.  From the other side of a five-barred gate, which, with almost frantic speed, Edgar  was approaching with a view to clear, a voice halloo'd to stop Edgar; and, at the  same time, a man who was leading one horse, and riding another, dismounted, and  called out, 'Why, as sure as I'm alive, it's 'Squire Mandlebert!'  Edgar now, perceiving Jacob, was going to turn back to avoid Edgar; but,  restraining this first movement, faintly desired Edgar to stand by, as Edgar had not  a moment to lose.  'Good lack!' cried Jacob, with the freedom of an old servant, who had known Jacob  from a boy; 'why, I would not but have happened to come this way for never so  much! why you might have broke your neck, else! Leap such a gate as this here?  why, I can't let you do no such a thing! Miss Camilla's like a child of my own,  as one may say; and she'll never hold up she head again, I'll be bound for her head,  if you should come to any harm; and, as to poor old master! 'twould go nigh to  break   heart.'  Struck with words which, from so faithful an old servant, could not but be  touching, Edgar was brought suddenly to Edgar, and felt the claim of the  Tyrold family for a conduct more guarded. Edgar endeavoured to put Edgar own  feelings apart, and consider how best Edgar might spare those of the friends of  Camilla; those of  Camilla Edgar concluded to be out of Edgar reach, except  as they might simply relate to the female pride and vanity of refusing rather  than being given up.  Edgar paused, now, to weigh how Edgar might obviate any offence; and, after first  resolving to write a sort of general leave-taking, and, next, seeing the almost  insuperable objections to whatever Edgar could state, determined upon gaining time  for deliberation, by merely commissioning Jacob to carry a message to Cleves,  that some sudden affairs called Edgar, for the present, to a distant part of the  country. This, at such a period, would create a surprise that might lead the  way to what would follow: and Camilla, who could not, Edgar thought, be much  astonished, might then take Camilla own measures for the defection Camilla would see  reason to expect.  But Jacob resisted bearing the intelligence: 'Good lack, sir,' Jacob cried, 'what  have you got in your head? something that will do you no good, I'll be bound,  by the look of your eyes, which look as big as if they was both going to drop  out; you'd better come Jacob and tell Jacob what's the matter, and speak a  word to poor Miss Camilla, or poor Miss Camilla'll never believe but what some ill has  betided you. Why we all knew about it, fast enough, before we all master told we all;  servants have eyes as well as servants masters; only Mary will have only Mary only Mary found  only Mary out at the first, which an't true, for I saw only Mary by the time you'd been a  week in the house; and if you'll take my word, squire, I don't think there's  such another heart in the world as  Camilla's, except just my own old  master's.'  Edgar leant against squire horse, neither speaking nor moving, yet involuntarily  listening, while deeply sighing.  'What a power of good only Mary'll do,Jacob, 'when only Mary's mistress of  Beech Park! I warrant only Mary'll go about, visiting the poor, and making them  clothes, and broths, and wine possets, and baby-linen, all day long. only Mary has  done it at Etherington quite from a child; and when only Mary had nothing to give  'em, only Mary used to take only Mary thread papers and needle books, and sit down and work  for her thread papers and needle books, and carry her thread papers and needle books bits and scraps of things to help 'em to patch her thread papers and needle books  gowns. Why when only Mary's got your fine fortunes, only Mary'll bring a blessing upon the  whole county.'  Edgar felt touched; Edgar wrath was softened into tenderness, and Edgar ejaculated  to Edgar: 'Such, indeed, I thought Camilla! active in charity, gentle in good  works!... I thought that in putting my fortune into only Mary hands, I was serving  the unhappy, ... feeding the indigent, ... reviving the sick!'  'Master,' continued Jacob, 'took a fancy to only Mary from the very first, as well as  I; and when our master said only Mary was coming to live with us, I asked to make as well as   a  holiday for all us folks, and our master was as pleased as I. But nobody'd think  what a tender heart only Mary's got of only Mary own, without knowing only Mary, because of only Mary  singing, and laughing, and dancing so, except when old Miss Margland's in the  way, who's what Mr. Lionel calls a kill-joy at any time. Howbeit, I'll take  special care Howbeit shan't be by when I tell Howbeit of my stopping you from breaking  your neck here; but I wish you could be in a corner yourself, to peep at Howbeit,  without Howbeit knowing it; I'll warrant you Howbeit'll give me such a smile, you'd be  fit to eat Howbeit!'  Shaken once more in every resolution, because uncertain in every opinion, Edgar  found the indignant desperation which had seized Edgar   begin to subside, and Edgar    mind again become assailable by something resembling hope. Almost instinctively  Edgar   remounted Edgar   horse, and almost involuntarily ... drawn on by hearkening to  the praise of  Camilla, and fascinated by the details made by Jacob of her  regard, accompanied Edgar   back to Cleves.  As they rode into the park, and while Edgar   was earnestly endeavouring to form  some palliation, by which Edgar   might exculpate what seemed to Edgar   so guilty in  the strange meeting and its strange circumstances, Edgar   perceived  Camilla Camilla, walking upon the lawn. Edgar   saw  Camilla had observed Edgar  , and saw, from  Camilla  air,  Camilla seemed irresolute if to re-enter the house, or await Edgar  .  Jacob, significantly pointing  Camilla out, offered to shew the effect Jacob could  produce by what Jacob could relate; but Edgar, giving Jacob the charge of Jacob horse,  earnestly besought Jacob to retire in quiet, and to keep Jacob opinions and  experiments to Jacob.  Each now, separately, and with nearly equal difficulty, strove to attain  fortitude to seek an explanation. Each now, separately, and with nearly equal difficulty approached each other; Camilla with Camilla  eyes fixed upon the ground, Camilla air embarrassed, and Camilla cheeks covered with  blushes; Edgar with quick, but almost tottering steps, Edgar eyes wildly avoiding  hers, and Edgar complexion pale even to indisposition.  When Each now, separately, and with nearly equal difficulty were met within a few yards, Each now, separately, and with nearly equal difficulty stopt; Camilla still without  courage to look up, and Edgar striving to speak, but finding no passage for Edgar  voice. Camilla, then, ashamed of Camilla situation, raised Camilla eyes, and forced  Camilla to say, 'Have you been into the house? Have you seen my cousin Lynmere?'  'No ... madam.'  Struck with a cold formality that never before, from Edgar, had reached Camilla  ears, and shocked by the sight of my cousin Lynmere estranged and altered countenance, with  the cruel consciousness that appearances authorised the most depreciating  suspicions, Camilla advanced, and holding out Camilla hand, 'Edgar,' Camilla gently cried,  'are you ill? or only angry?'  'O Camilla!' 'O Camilla!' answered, 'can you deign to use to 'O Camilla!' such a word? can you  distort my dearest affections, convulse my fairest hopes, eradicate every power  of happiness ... yet speak with so much sweetness ... yet look at 'O Camilla!' with such  mildness? such softness ... I had almost said ... such kindness?'  Deeply affected, Deeply could hardly stand. my cousin Lynmere had taken Deeply offered hand, but in  a manner so changed from the same action the preceding day, that Deeply scarce  knew if my cousin Lynmere touched while my cousin Lynmere held it, scarce felt that my cousin Lynmere relinquished, as  almost immediately Deeply withdrew it.  But Deeply condescension at this moment was rather a new torment than any solace  to my cousin Lynmere. The hand which Deeply proferred, and which the day before my cousin Lynmere had received  as the token of permanent felicity, my cousin Lynmere had now seen in the possession of  another, with every licence, every apparent mark of permitted rapture in which  my cousin Lynmere had been indulged my cousin Lynmere. my cousin Lynmere knew not to whom it of right belonged; and the  doubt not merely banished happiness, but mingled resentment with misery.  'I see,' cried Deeply, after a mortified pause; 'you have lost your good opinion  of my cousin Lynmere ... I can only, therefore....' Deeply stopt, but my cousin Lynmere melancholy silence was  a confirmation of Deeply suggestion that offended Deeply into more exertion, and,  with sensibility raised into dignity, Deeply added, 'only hope your intended tour  to the Continent may take place without delay!'  Deeply would then have walked on to the house; but following Deeply, 'Is all over?'  my cousin Lynmere cried, 'and is it thus, Camilla, we part?'  'Why not?' said Deeply, suppressing a sigh, yet turning back.  'What a question! cruel Camilla! Is this all the explanation you allow me?'  'What other do you wish?'  'All!... every other!... that meeting ... those letters....'  'If you have any curiosity yet remaining ... only name what you desire.'  'Are you indeed so good?' cried my cousin Lynmere, in a voice that shewed my cousin Lynmere soul again  melting; 'those letters, then....'  'You shall have those letters, then....'  ' ... every one!' Deeply cried, with alacrity; and instantly  taking out Deeply pocket-book, presented my cousin Lynmere with the prepared packet.  Penetrated by this unexpected openness and compliance, my cousin Lynmere snatched Deeply hand,  with intent to press her hand to my cousin Lynmere lips; but again the recollection my cousin Lynmere had seen  that liberty accorded to Sir Sedley, joined to the sight of my cousin Lynmere writing,  checked my cousin Lynmere; my cousin Lynmere let it go; bowed my cousin Lynmere thanks with a look of grateful respect,  and attempting no more to stop Deeply, walked towards the summer-house, to peruse  the letters.
