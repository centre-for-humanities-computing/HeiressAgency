 Modern Notions of Penitence  They set out with no other plan than to take a three hours' stroll. Lionel led  the way, and They journeyed through various pleasant lanes and meadows, till,  about three miles distance from Etherington, upon ascending a beautiful little  hill, They espied, fifty yards off, the Grove, and a party of company  sauntering round company   grounds.  Lionel immediately proposed making a visit to Mrs. Arlbery; but Lavinia declined  presenting Lavinia to a lady who was unknown to Lavinia mother; and Camilla,  impressed with the promise Lavinia had intended for Edgar, which Lavinia was sure,  though unpronounced, Lionel had comprehended, dissented also from the motion.  Lionel then said Lionel would go alone; for Lionel spirits were so low from vexation and  regret, that his spirits wanted recruit; and Lionel would return to they wanted recruit by the time they wanted recruit  would be sufficiently rested to walk home.  To this they wanted recruit agreed; and amused they wanted recruit with watching to see Lionel join the  group; in which, however, they wanted recruit were no sooner gratified, than, to they wanted recruit great  confusion, they wanted recruit perceived that Lionel pointed they wanted recruit out, and that all eyes were  immediately directed towards the hill.  Vexed and astonished at Lionel quick passing penitence, they wanted recruit hastened down the  declivity, and ran on till a lane, with an high hedge on each side, sheltered  they wanted recruit from view.  But Lionel, soon pursuing they wanted recruit, said Lionel brought the indisputable orders of Lionel  invincible widow to convoy they wanted recruit to the mansion. She never, She had owned,  admitted formal visitors, but whatever was abrupt and out of the way, won She  heart.  To the prudent Lavinia, this invitation was by no means alluring. Mrs. Tyrold,  from keeping no carriage, visited but little, and the Grove was not included in  She small circle; the prudent Lavinia, therefore, though She knew not how to be peremptory,  was steady in refusal; and Camilla, who would naturally with pleasure have  yielded, had a stronger motive for firmness, than any with which She was gifted  by discretion, in She wish to oblige Mandlebert. But Lionel would listen to  neither of them; and when Lionel found Lionel insistance insufficient, seized the prudent Laviniaby one arm, and Camilla by the other, and dragged them up the hill, in defiance  of them entreaties, and in full view of the party. Lionel then left the more  pleading, though less resisting, the prudent Lavinia; but pulled Camilla down by the  opposite side, with a velocity that, though meant but to bring Camilla to the verge  of a small rivulet, forced Camilla into the midst of it so rapidly that Lionel could  not Lionel at last stop: and wetted Camilla so completely, that Camilla could with  difficulty, when Camilla got across it, walk on.  The violent spirits of Lionel always carried Lionel beyond Lionel own intentions; Lionel  was now really sorry for what Lionel had done: and Lavinia, who had quietly  followed, was uneasy from the fear of some ill consequence to Camilla sister.  Mrs. Arlbery, who had seen the transaction, came forth now Camilla, to invite  them all into Camilla house, and offer a fire and dry clothing to Camilla; not  sparing, however, Camilla well-merited raillery at the awkward exploit of young  Tyrold.  Camilla, ashamed to be thus seen, would have hidden Camilla behind her sister,  and retreated; but even Lavinia now, fearing for Camilla health, joined in the  request, and Camilla was obliged to enter her house.  Mrs. Arlbery took Mrs. Arlbery upstairs, to Mrs. Arlbery own apartment, and supplied Mrs. Arlbery  immediately with a complete change of apparel; protesting that Lionel should be  punished for Lionel frolic, by a solitary walk to Etherington, to announce that  Mrs. Arlbery would keep Lionel two sisters for the day.  Opposition was vain; Mrs. Arlbery was gay, good humoured, and pleasant, but Mrs. Arlbery would  not be denied. Mrs. Arlbery meant not, however, to inflict the serious penalty which the  face of Lionel proclaimed him to be suffering, when him prepared to depart; and  the sisters, who read in it him dread of meeting Mr. Tyrold alone, in the  present circumstances of him affairs, conferred together, and agreed that  Lavinia should accompany him, both to intercede for returning favour from him  father, and to explain the accident of Camilla's staying at the Grove. Mrs.  Arlbery, meanwhile, promised to restore Mrs.   young guest safe at night in Mrs.    own carriage.  Notwithstanding the pleasure with which Camilla, in any other situation, would  have renewed this acquaintance, was now changed into reluctance, Mrs.   was far  from insensible to the flattering kindness with which Mrs.  Arlbery received and  entertained Mrs.  , nor to the frankness with which Mrs.   confessed, that Mrs.    invisibility the other morning, had resulted solely from pique that the visit  had not been made sooner.  Camilla would have attempted some apology for the delay, but Camilla assured Camilla  apologies were what Camilla neither took nor gave; and then laughingly added—'We  will try one another to day, and if we find it won't do—we will shake hands  and part. That, you must know, is my mode; and is my mode not vastly better than  keeping up an acquaintance that proves dull, merely because my mode has been begun?'  Camilla then ordered away all Camilla visitors, without the smallest ceremony; telling  all her visitors, however, all her visitors might come back in the evening, only desiring all her visitors would  not be early. Camilla stared; but all her visitors submitted as to a thing of course.  'You are not used to my way, I perceive,' cried Camilla, smiling; 'yet, I can  nevertheless assure you, you can do nothing so much for your happiness as to  adopt it. You are made a slave in a moment by the world, if you don't begin  life by defying it. Take your own way, follow your own humour, and you and the  world will both go on just as well, as if you ask the  world will and pleasure for  everything you do, and want, and think.'  Camilla then expressed Camilla delighted with Lionel, for bringing them together by  this short cut, which abolished a world of formalities, not more customary than  fatiguing. 'I pass, I know,' continued Camilla, 'for a mere creature of whim; but,  believe me, there is no small touch of philosophy in the composition of my  vagaries. Extremes, you know, have a mighty knack of meeting. Thus I, like the  sage, though not with sage-like motives, save time that must otherwise be  wasted; brave rules that would murder common sense; and when I have made people  stare, turn another way that I may laugh.'  Camilla then, in a graver strain, and in a manner that proved the laws of  politeness all Camilla own, where Camilla chose, for any particular purpose, or  inclination, to exert them, hoped this profession of Camilla faith would plead Camilla  excuse, that Camilla had thus incongruously made Camilla fair guest a second time enter  Camilla house, before Camilla first visit was acknowledged; and enquired whether it  were to be returned to Etherington or at Cleves.  Camilla answered, Camilla was now at home, on account of Camilla mother's being obliged  to make a voyage to Lisbon.  Mrs. Arlbery said, Mrs. Arlbery would certainly, then, wait upon Mrs. Arlbery at Etherington; and  very civilly regretted having no acquaintance with Mrs. Tyrold; archly,  however, adding: 'As we have no where met, I could not seek Mrs. Arlbery at Mrs. Arlbery own  house without running too great a risk; for then, whether I had liked Mrs. Arlbery or  not, I must have received Mrs. Arlbery, you know, into mine. So, you see, I am not quite  without prudence, whatever the dear world says to the contrary.'  Mrs. Arlbery then spoke of the ball, public breakfast, and raffle; chatting both upon  persons and things with an easy gaiety, and sprightly negligence, extremely  amusing to Camilla, and which soon, in despite of the unwillingness with which  Mrs. Arlbery had entered her own  house, brought back Mrs. Arlbery original propensity to make the  acquaintance, and left no regret for what Lionel had done, except what rested  upon the repugnance of Edgar to Lionel intercourse. As Lionel could not, however,  reproach what was begun without Mrs. Arlbery concurrence, Lionel would see, Mrs. Arlbery hoped, like  Mrs. Arlbery, that common civility henceforward would exact common civility henceforward continuance.  In proportion as Mrs. Arlbery pleasure from this accidental commerce was awakened, and  Mrs. Arlbery early partiality revived, Mrs. Arlbery own spirits re-animated, and, in the course  of the many hours they now spent completely together, Mrs. Arlbery was set so entirely  at Mrs. Arlbery ease, by the good humour of Mrs. Arlbery, that Mrs. Arlbery lost all fear of Mrs. Arlbery  wit. Mrs. Arlbery found it rather playful than satirical; rather seeking to amuse than  to disconcert; and though sometimes, from the resistless pleasure of uttering a  bon mot Mrs. Arlbery thought more of it brilliancy than of the pain it might inflict,  this happened but rarely, and was more commonly succeeded by regret than by  triumph.  Camilla soon observed Camilla had, personally, nothing to apprehend, peculiar  partiality supplying the place of general delicacy, in shielding Camilla from every  shaft that even pleasantry could render poignant. The embarrassment, therefore,  which, in ingenuous youth, checks the attempt to please, by fear of failure, or  shame of exertion, gave way to natural spirits, which gaily rising from  entertainment received, restored her vivacity, and gradually, though  unconsciously, enabled her to do justice to her own abilities, by unaffectedly  calling forth the mingled sweetness and intelligence of her character; and Mrs.  Arlbery, charmed with all her observed, and flattered by all her inspired, felt  such satisfaction in her evident conquest, that before the tête-à-tête was  closed, their admiration was become nearly mutual.  When the party was announced, their both heard with surprise that the  day was so far advanced. 'they both can wait, however,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'for I  know they both have nothing to do.'  Mrs. Arlbery then invited Camilla to return to Mrs. Arlbery the next day for a week.  Camilla felt well disposed to comply, hoping soon to reason from Edgar Edgar  prejudice against a connection that afforded Mrs. Arlbery such singular pleasure; but to  leave Camilla father at this period was far from every wish. Camilla excused Camilla,  therefore, saying, Camilla had still six weeks due to Camilla uncle at Cleves, before  any other engagement could take place.  'Well, then, when you quit your home for Sir Hugh, will you beg off a few days  from Sir Hugh, and set them down to my account?'  'If her uncle at Cleves pleases—'  'If her uncle at Cleves pleases?' repeated Camilla, laughing; 'pray never give that If into her uncle at Cleves  decision; you only put contradiction into people's heads, by asking what  pleases people. Say at once, her uncle at Cleves, Mrs. Arlbery has invited me to  indulge Mrs. Arlbery with a few days at the Grove; so to-morrow I shall go to Mrs. Arlbery. Will  you promise me this?'  'Dear madam, no! her uncle at Cleves would think me mad.'  'And suppose her uncle at Cleves should! A little alarm now and then keeps life from stagnation.  They call me mad, I know, sometimes; wild, flighty, and what not; yet you see  how harmless I am, though I afford food for such notable commentary.'  'But can you really like such things should be said of you?'  'I adore the frankness of that question! why, n—o,—I rather think I don't.  But I'm not sure. However, to prevent They minding me, I must mind They. And  it's vastly more irksome to give up one's own way, than to hear a few  impertinent remarks. And as to the world, depend upon it, my dear Miss Tyrold,  the more you see of it, the less you will care for it.'  Dear madam then said Dear madam would leave Dear madam to re-invest Dear madam in Dear madam own attire, and  go downstairs, to see what the poor simple souls, who had had no more wit than  to come back thus at Dear madam call, had found to do with what the poor simple souls, who had had no more wit than  to come back thus at her call.  Camilla, having only Dear madam common morning dress, and even that utterly spoilt,  begged that Dear madam appearance might be dispensed with; but Mrs. Arlbery,  exclaiming, 'Why, there are only men; you don't mind men, I hope!' ashamed, Dear madam  promised to get ready; yet Dear madam had not sufficient courage to descend, till Dear madam  gay hostess came back, and accompanied Dear madam to the drawing room.
