 The accomplished Monkies  When Camilla descended, she found Sir Sedley Clarendel and General Kinsale in  attendance; and saw, from the parlour window, Miss Dennel sauntering before the  house, with the newly made acquaintance of the preceding evening.  The Baronet, who was to drive Mrs. Arlbery, enquired if Camilla would not  prefer, also, an open carriage. Mrs. Arlbery seconded the motion. Miss Dennel,  then, running to her father, exclaimed, 'Pray, papa, let's take this lady I've  been talking with in the coach with us. She's the good-naturedest creature I  ever knew.'  'Who is she? what's her name?'  'O, I don't know that, papa; but I'll go and ask her.'  Flying then back, 'Pray, ma'am,' she cried, 'what's your name? because papa  wants to know.'  'Why, my dear, my name's Mittin. So you may think of me when you put on your  gloves.'  'Papa, her name's Mittin,' cried Miss Dennel, scampering again to her father.  'Well, and who is she?'  'O, la, I'm sure I can't tell, only she's a gentlewoman.'  'And how do you know that?'  'She told me so herself.'  'And where does she live?'  'Just by, papa, at that house you see there.'  'O, well, if she's a neighbour, that's enough. I've no more to say.'  'O, then, I'll ask her!' cried Miss Dennel, jumping, 'dear! I'm so glad!  'twould have been so dull, only papa and I. I'm resolved, when I've a house of  my own, I'll never go alone any where with papa.'  This being muttered, the invitation was made and accepted, and the parties set  forward.  The ride was perfectly pleasing to Camilla, now revived and cheerful; Sir  Sedley was free from airs; Mrs. Arlbery drew them into conversation with one  another, and none of them were glad when Mr. Dennel, called 'stop! or you'll  drive too far.'  Camilla, who, supposing she was going, as usual, to the Pantiles, had got into  the phaeton without inquiry; and who, finding afterwards her mistake, concluded  they were merely taking an airing, now observed she was advancing towards a  crowd, and presently perceived a booth, and an immense sign hung out from it,  exhibiting a man monkey, or ourang outang.  Though excessively fluttered, she courageously, and at once, told Mrs. Arlbery  she begged to be excused proceeding.  Mrs. Arlbery, who had heard, at the play, the general objections of Mandlebert,  though she had not attended to her answer, conjectured her reason for  retreating, and laughed, but said she would not oppose her.  Camilla then begged to wait in Mr. Dennel's carriage, that she might keep no  one else from the show. Sir Sedley, saying it would be an excruciatingly vulgar  sight, proposed they should all return; but she pleaded strongly against  breaking up the party, though, while she was handed out, to go back to the  coach, the Dennels and Mrs. Mittin had alighted, and it had driven off.  The chagrin of Camilla was so palpable, that Mrs. Arlbery herself agreed to  resign the scheme; and Sir Sedley, who drew up to them, said he should rejoice  in being delivered from it: but Miss Dennel, who was waiting without the booth  for her aunt, was ready to cry at the thought of losing the sight, which Mrs.  Mittin had assured her was extremely pretty; and, after some discussion,  Camilla was reduced to beg she might do no mischief, and consent to make one.  A more immediate distress now occurred to her; she heard Mr. Dennel call out to  the man stationed at the entrance of the booth, 'What's to pay?' and  recollected she had no money left.  'What your Honor pleases,' was the answer, 'but gentlefolks gives half-a-crown.'  'I'm sure it's well worth it,' said Mrs. Mittin, 'for it's one of the most  curious things you ever saw. You can't give less, sir.' And she passed nimbly  by, without paying at all: but added, 'I had a ticket the first day, and now I  come every day for nothing, if it don't rain, for one only need to pay at  first.'  Mr. Dennel and his daughter followed, and Camilla was beginning a hesitating  speech to Mrs. Arlbery, as that lady, not attending to her, said to Mr. Dennel:  'Well, frank me also; but take care what you pay; I'm not at all sure I shall  ever return it. All I save goes to my ponies.' And, handed by the General, she  crossed the barrier; not hearing the voice of her young friend, which was  timidly beseeching her to stop.  Camilla was now in extreme confusion. She put her hand into her pocket, took it  out, felt again, and again brought forth the hand empty.  The Major, who was before her, and who watched her, begged leave to settle with  the booth-keeper; but Camilla, to whom he grew daily more irksome, again  preferred a short obligation to the Baronet, and blushingly asked if he would  once more be her banker?  Sir Sedley, by no means suspecting the necessity that urged this condescension,  was surprised and delighted, and almost without knowing it himself, became all  that was attentive, obliging, and pleasing.  Before they were seated, the young Ensign, Mr. Macdersey, issuing from a group  of gentlemen, addressed himself to Camilla, though with an air that spoke him  much discomposed and out of spirits. 'I hope you are well, Miss Camilla  Tyrold,' he cried; 'and have left all your family well? particularly the  loveliest of your sex, that angel of beauty, the divine Miss Lynmere?'  'Except the company present!' said Mrs. Arlbery; 'always except the company  present, when you talk of beauty to women.'  'I would not except even the company absent!' replied he, with warmth; but was  interrupted from proceeding, by what the master of the booth called his Consort  of Musics: in which not less than twenty monkies contributed their part; one  dreadfully scraping a bow across the strings of a vile kit, another beating a  drum, another with a fife, a fourth with a bagpipe, and the sixteen remainder  striking together tongs, shovels, and pokers, by way of marrowbones and  cleavers. Every body stopt their ears, though no one could forbear laughing at  their various contortions, and horrible grimaces, till the master of the booth,  to keep them, he said, in tune, dealt about such fierce blows with a stick,  that they set up a general howling, which he called the Wocal part of his  Consort, not more stunning to the ear, than offensive to all humanity. The  audience applauded by loud shouts, but Mrs. Arlbery, disgusted, rose to quit  the booth. Camilla eagerly started up to second the motion, but her eyes still  more expeditiously turned from the door, upon encountering those of Edgar; who,  having met the empty coach of Mr. Dennel, had not been able to refrain from  inquiring where its company had been deposited; nor, upon hearing it was at the  accomplished Monkies, from hastening to the spot, to satisfy himself if or not  Camilla had been steady to her declaration. But he witnessed at once the  propriety of his advice, and its failure.  The master of the booth could not endure to see the departure of the most  brilliant part of his spectators, and made an harangue, promising the company,  at large, if they would submit to postponing the Consort, in order to oblige  his friends the Quality, they should have it, with the newest squalls in taste,  afterwards.  The people laughed and clapped, and Mrs. Arlbery sat down.  In a few minutes, the performers were ready for a new exhibition. They were  dressed up as soldiers, who, headed by a corporal, came forward to do their  exercises.  Mrs. Arlbery, laughing, told the General, as he was upon duty, he should  himself take the command: the General, a pleasant, yet cool and sensible man,  did not laugh less; but the Ensign, more warm tempered, and wrong headed,  seeing a feather in a monkey's cap, of the same colour, by chance, as in his  own, fired with hasty indignation, and rising, called out to the master of the  booth: 'What do you mean by this, sir? do you mean to put an affront upon our  corps?'  The man, startled, was going most humbly to protest his innocence of any such  design; but the laugh raised against the Ensign amongst the audience gave him  more courage, and he only simpered without speaking.  'What do you mean by grinning at me, sir?' said Macdersey; 'do you want me to  cane you?'  'Cane me!' cried the man enraged, 'by what rights?'  Macdersey, easily put off all guard, was stepping over the benches, with his  cane uplifted, when his next neighbour, tightly holding him, said, in a half  whisper, 'If you'll take my advice, you'd a deal better provoke him to strike  the first blow.'  Macdersey, far more irritated by this counsel than by the original offence,  fiercely looked back, calling out 'The first blow! What do you mean by that,  sir?'  'No offence, sir,' answered the person, who was no other than the slow and  solemn Mr. Dubster; 'but only to give you a hint for your own good; for if you  strike first, being in his own house, as one may say, he may take the law of  you.'  'The law!' repeated the fiery Ensign; 'the law was made for poltroons: a man of  honour does not know what it means.'  'If you talk at that rate, sir,' said Dubster, in a low voice, 'it may bring  you into trouble.'  'And who are you, sir, that take upon you the presumption to give me your  opinion?'  'Who am I, sir? I am a gentleman, if you must needs know.'  'A gentleman! who made you so?'  'Who made me so? why leaving off business! what would you have make me so? you  may tell me if you are any better, if you come to that.'  Macdersey, of an ancient and respectable family, incensed past measure, was  turning back upon Mr. Dubster; when the General, taking him gently by the hand,  begged he would recollect himself.  'That's very true, sir, very true, General!' cried he, profoundly bowing; 'what  you say is very true. I have no right to put myself into a passion before my  superior officer, unless he puts me into it himself; in which case 'tis his own  fault. So I beg your pardon, General, with all my heart. And I'll go out of the  booth without another half syllable. But if ever I detect any of those monkies  mocking us, and wearing our feathers, when you a'n't by, I sha'n't put up with  it so mildly. I hope you'll excuse me, General.'  He then bowed to him again, and begged pardon of all the ladies; but, in  quitting the booth, contemptuously said to Mr. Dubster: 'As to you, you little  dirty fellow, you a'n't worth my notice.'  'Little dirty fellow!' repeated Mr. Dubster, when he was gone; 'How come you to  think of that? why I'm as clean as hands can make me!'  'Come, sir, come,' said Mrs. Mittin, reaching over to him, and stroking his  arm, 'don't be angry; these things will happen, sometimes, in public companies;  but gentlemen should be above minding them. He meant no harm, I dare say.'  'O, as to that, ma'am,' answered Mr. Dubster proudly, 'I don't much care if he  did or not: it's no odds to me. Only I don't know much what right he has to  defame me. I wonder who he thinks he is that he may break the peace for  nothing. I can't say I'm much a friend to such behaviour. Treating people with  so little ceremony.'  'I protest,' cried Sir Sedley to Camilla, ''tis your favourite swain from the  Northwick assembly! wafted on some zephyr of Hope, he has pursued you to  Tunbridge. I flatter myself he has brought his last bran new cloaths to claim  your fair hand at the master of the ceremonies' ball.'  'Hush! hush!' cried Camilla, in a low voice; 'he will take you literally should  he hear you!'  Mr. Dubster, now perceiving her, bowed low from the place where he stood, and  called out, 'How do you do, ma'am? I ask pardon for not speaking to you before;  but I can't say as I see you.'  Camilla was forced to bow, though she made no answer. But he continued with his  usual steadiness; 'Why, that was but a unked morning we was together so long,  ma'am, in my new summer-house. We was in fine jeopardy, that's the truth of it.  Pray, how does the young gentleman do as took away our ladder?'  'What a delectable acquaintance!' cried Sir Sedley; 'would you have the cruelty  to keep such a treasure to yourself? present me, I supplicate!'  'O, I know you well enough, sir,' said Mr. Dubster, who overheard him; 'I see  you at the hop at the White Hart; and I believe you know me pretty well too,  sir, if I may take account by your staring. Not that I mind it in the least.'  'Come, come, don't be touchy,' said Mrs. Mittin; 'can't you be good-natured,  and hold your tongue? what signifies taking things amiss? It only breeds ill  words.'  'That's very sensibly observed upon!' said Mr. Dennel; 'I don't know when I've  heard any thing more sensibly said.'  'O, as to that, I don't take it amiss in the least,' cried Mr. Dubster; 'if the  gentleman's a mind to stare, let him stare. Only I should like to know what  it's for. It's no better than child's play, as one may say, making one look  foolish for nothing.'  The ourang outang was now announced, and Mrs. Arlbery immediately left the  booth, accompanied by her party, and speedily followed by Edgar.  Neither of the carriages were in waiting, but they would not return to the  booth. Sir Sedley, to whom standing was still rather inconvenient, begged a  cast in the carriage of a friend, who was accidentally passing by.  Macdersey, who joined them, said he had been considering what that fellow had  proposed to him, of taking the first blow, and found he could not put up with  it: and upon the appearance of Mr. Dubster, who in quitting the booth was  preparing, with his usual leisurely solemnity, to approach Camilla, darted  forward and seizing him by the collar, exclaimed, 'Retract, sir! Retract!'  Mr. Dubster stared, at first, without speech or opposition; but being released  by the Major, whom the General begged to interfere, he angrily said: 'Pray,  sir, what business have you to take hold of a body in such a manner as that?  It's an assault, sir, and so I can prove. And I'm glad of it; for now I can  serve you as I did another gentleman once before, that I smarted out of a good  ten pound out of his pocket, for a knock he gave me, for a mere nothing, just  like this here pulling one by the collar, nobody knows why.'  The Major, endeavouring to quiet Macdersey, advised him to despise so low a  person.  'So I will, my dear friend,' he returned, 'as soon as ever I have given him the  proper chastisement for his ignorance. But I must do that first. You won't take  it ill, Major.'  'I believe,' cried Mr. Dubster, holding up both his hands, 'the like of this  was never heard of! Here's a gentleman, as he calls himself, ready to take away  my life, with his own good will, for nothing but giving him a little bit of  advice! However, it's all one to me. The law is open to all. And if any one  plays their tricks upon me, they shall pay for their fun. I'm none of your tame  ones to put up with such a thing for nothing. I'm above that, I promise you.'  'Don't talk, sir, don't talk!' cried Macdersey; 'it's a thing I can't bear from  a mean person, to be talked to. I had a hundred thousand times rather stand to  be shot at.'  'Not talk, sir? I should be glad to know what right you has to hinder me,  provided I say nothing against the law? And as to being a mean person, it's  more than you can prove, for I'm sure you don't know who I am, nor nothing  about me. I may be a lord, for any thing you know, though I don't pretend to  say I am. But as to what people take me for, that behave so out of character,  it's what I sha'n't trouble my head about. They may take me for a  chimney-sweeper, or they may take me for a duke; which they like. I sha'n't  tell them whether I'm one or t'other, or whether I'm neither. And as to not  talking, I shall hold my tongue when I think proper.'  'Ask my pardon this instant, fellow!' cried the Ensign, whom the Major, at the  motion of the General, now caught by the arm, and hurried from the spot: Mrs.  Mittin, at the same moment pulling away Mr. Dubster, and notably expounding to  him the advantages of patience and good humour.  Mrs. Arlbery, wearied both of this squabble and of waiting, took the arm of the  General, and said she would walk home; Miss Dennel lovingly held by Mrs.  Mittin, with whom her father also assorted, and by whom Mr. Dubster was drawn  on.  Camilla alone had no immediate companion, as the Major was occupied by the  Ensign. Edgar saw her disengaged. He trembled, he wavered; he wished the Major  back; he wished him still more at a distance too remote ever to return; he  thought he would instantly mount his horse, and gallop towards Beech Park; but  the horse was not ready, and Camilla was in sight;—and, in less than a  minute, he found himself, scarce knowing how, at her side.  Camilla felt a pleasure that bounded to her heart, though the late assertions  of Mrs. Arlbery prepared her to expect him. He knew not, however, what to say;  he felt mortified and disappointed, and when he had uttered something scarce  intelligible about the weather, he walked on in silence.  Camilla, whose present train of thoughts had no discordant tendency, broke  through this strangeness herself, and said: 'How frivolous I must appear to  you! but indeed I was at the very door of the booth, before I knew whither the  party was going.'  'You did not, I hope, at least,' he cried, 'when you had entered it, deem me  too rigid, too austere, that I thought the species, both of company and of  entertainment, ill calculated for a young lady?'  'Rigid! austere!' repeated she; 'I never thought you either! never—and if  once again—' she stopt; embarrassed, ashamed.  'If once again what?' cried he in a tremulous voice; 'what would Miss Camilla  say?—would she again—Is there yet—What would Miss Camilla say?—'  Camilla felt confounded, both with ideas of what he meant to allude to, and  what construction he had put upon her half finished sentence. Impatient,  however, to clear that, 'If once more,' she cried, 'you could prevail with  yourself—now and then—from time to time—to give me an hint, an idea—of  what you think right—I will promise, if not a constant observance, at least a  never-failing sense of your kindness.'  The revulsion in the heart, in the whole frame of Edgar, was almost too  powerful for restraint: he panted for an immediate explanation of every past  and every present difficulty, and a final avowal that she was either  self-destined to the Major, or that he had no rival to fear: But before he  could make any answer, a sudden and violent shower broke up the conference, and  grouped the whole party under a large tree.  This interruption, however, had no power upon their thoughts; neither of them  heard a word that was saying; each ruminated intently, though confusedly, upon  what already was passed. Yet where the wind precipitated the rain, Edgar  stationed himself, and held his hat to intercept its passage to Camilla; and as  her eye involuntarily was caught by the shower that pattered upon his head and  shoulders, she insensibly pressed nearer to the trunk of the tree, to afford  more shelter to him from its branches.  The rest of the party partook not of this taciturnity: Mr. Dubster, staring  Mrs. Mittin full in the face, exclaimed: 'I think I ought to know you, ma'am,  asking your pardon?'  'No matter for that!' cried she, turning with quickness to Camilla; 'Lord,  miss—I don't know your name,—how your poor hat is all I don't know how! as  limp, and as flimzy, as if it had been in a wash-tub!'  'I've just bethought me,' continued he, 'where it was we used to see one  another, and all the whole manner of it. I've got it as clear in my head as if  it was but yesterday. Don't you remember—'  'Can't you stand a little out, there?' interrupted she; 'what signifies a man's  old coat? don't you see how you let all the rain come upon this young lady? you  should never think of yourself, but only of what you can do to be obliging.'  'A very good rule, that! a very good one indeed!' said Mr. Dennel; 'I wish  everybody would mind it.'  'I'm as willing to mind it, I believe,' said Mr. Dubster, 'as my neighbours;  but as to being wet through, for mere complaisance, I don't think it fair to  expect such a thing of nobody. Besides, this is not such an old coat as you may  think for. If you was to see what I wear at home, I promise you would not think  so bad of it. I don't say it's my best; who'd be fool then, to wear it every  day? However, I believe it's pretty nigh as good as that I had on that night I  saw you at Mrs. Purdle's, when, you know, one of your pattens—'  'Come, come, what's the man talking about? one person should not take all the  conversation up so. Dear miss ... do tell me your name?... I am so sorry for  your hat, I can't but think of it; it looks as dingy!...'  'Why, now, you won't make me believe,' said Mr. Dubster, 'you've forgot how  your patten broke; and how I squeezed my finger under the iron? And how I'd  like to have lost the use of it? There would have been a fine job! And how Mrs.  Purdle....'  'I'm sure the shower's over,' cried Mrs. Mittin, 'and if we stay here, we shall  have all the droppings of the leaves upon us. Poor miss thing-o-me's hat is  spoilt already. There's no need to make it worse.'  'And how Mrs. Purdle,' he continued, 'was obliged to lend you a pair of shoes  and stockings, because you was wet through your feet? And how they would not  fit you, and kept tumbling off? And how, when somebody come to fetch you in  their own coach, you made us say you was taken ill, because you was so daubed  with mud and mire, you was ashamed to shew yourself? And how....'  'I can't think what you are talking of,' said Mrs. Mittin; 'but come, let's you  and I go a little way on, to see if the rain's over.' She then went some paces  from the tree, and said: 'What signifies running on so, Mr. Dubster, about  things nobody knows anything of? It's tiring all the company to death. You  should never talk about your own fingers, and hap-hazards, to genteel people.  You should only talk about agreeable subjects as I do. See how they all like  me! That gentleman brought me to the monkies in his own coach.'  'As to that,' answered he, gravely, 'I did not mean, in the least, to say  anything disagreeable; only I thought it odd you should not seem to know me  again, considering Mrs. Purdle used——'  'Why you've no nous, Mr. Dubster; Mrs. Purdle's a very good sort of woman and  the best friend I have in the world, perhaps, at the bottom; but she i'n't a  sort of person to talk of before gentlefolks. You should talk to great people  about their own affairs, and what you can do to please them, and find out how  you can serve them, if you'd be treated genteelly by them, as I am. Why, I go  every where, and see every thing, and it costs me nothing. A friend, a lady of  great fashion, took me one day to the monkies, and paid for me; and I've gone  since, whenever I will, for nothing.'  'Nobody treats me to nothing,' answered he, in a melancholy voice, 'whatever's  the reason: except when I make friends with somebody that can let me in free,  sometimes. And I get a peep, now and then, at what goes forward, that way.'  'But you are rich enough to pay for yourself now, Mr. Dubster; good lack! if I  had such a fortune as yours, I'd go all the world over, and thanks to nobody.'  'And how long would you be rich then, Mrs. Mittin? Who'd give you your money  again when you'd spent it? I got mine hard enough. I sha'n't fool it away in a  hurry, I promise you!'  'I can't say I see that, Mr. Dubster, when two of your wives died so soon, and  left you so handsome.'  'Why, yes, I don't say to the contrary of that; but then, think of the time  before, when I was 'prentice!—'  The shower was now over, and the party proceeded as before.  Edgar, uncertain, irresolute, walked on in silence: yet attentive, assiduous,  even tenderly watchful to guide, guard, and assist his fair companion in her  way. The name of the Major trembled perpetually upon his lips; but fear what  might be the result of his inquiries stopt his speech till they approached the  house; when he commanded voice to say: 'You permit, then, the renewal of my old  privilege?—'  'Permit! I wish for it!'  They were now at the door. Edgar, not daring to speak again to Camilla, and not  able to address any one else, took his leave; enchanted that he was authorized,  once more, to inform himself with openness of the state of her affairs, and of  her conduct. And Camilla, dwelling with delight upon the discernment of Mrs.  Arlbery, blest the happy penetration that had endowed her with courage to speak  again to Edgar in terms of friendship and confidence.  Mrs. Mittin, declaring she could not eat till she had seen what could be done  for the hat of Miss Tyrold, accompanied her upstairs, took it off herself,  wiped it, smoothed, and tried to new arrange it; and, at last, failing to  succeed, insisted upon taking it home, to put it in order, and promised to  return it in the morning time enough for the Pantiles. Camilla was much  ashamed; but she had no means to buy another, and she had now lost her  indifference to going abroad. She thought, therefore, this new acquaintance at  least as useful as she was officious, and accepted her civility with thanks.
