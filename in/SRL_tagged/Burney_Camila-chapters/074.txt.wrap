 A Call of the House  Edgar returned to the parlour with a countenance so much brightened, a joy so  open, a confidence so manly, and an air so strongly announcing some interesting  intelligence, that his history required no prelude. 'Edgar,' said Mr. Tyrold,  'you have a look to disarm care of its corrosion. You could not take a better  time to wear so cheering an aspect; I have just learnt that my wife can fix no  sort of date for her return; I must borrow, therefore, some reflected  happiness; and none, after my children, can bring its sunshine so home to my  bosom as yourself.'  'What a fortunate moment have you chosen,' cried Edgar, affectionately taking  him by the hand, 'to express this generous pleasure in seeing me happy! will  you repent, will you retract, when you hear in what it may involve you?...  Dearest sir! my honoured, my parental friend! to what a test shall I put your  kindness!... Will you give me in charge one of the dearest ties of your  existence? will you repose in my care so large a portion of your peace? will  you trust to me your Camilla?...'  With all the ardour of her character, all the keen and quick feelings of her  sensitive mind, scarce had Camilla herself been more struck, more penetrated  with sudden joy, sudden wonder, sudden gratification of every kind, than Mr.  Tyrold felt at this moment. He more than returned the pressure with which Edgar  held his hand, and instantly answered, 'Yes, my excellent young friend, without  hesitation, without a shadow of apprehension for her happiness! though she is  all the fondest father can wish; ... and though she only who gave her to me is  dearer!'  Felicity and tenderness were now the sole guests in the breast of Edgar. He  kissed with reverence the hand of Mr. Tyrold, called him by the honoured and  endearing title of father; acknowledged that, from the earliest period of  observation, Camilla had seemed to him the most amiable of human creatures;  spoke with the warm devotion he sincerely felt for her of Mrs. Tyrold; and was  breathing forth his very soul in tender rapture upon his happy prospects, when  something between a sigh and a groan from the baronet, made him hastily turn  round, apologise for not sooner addressing him, and respectfully solicit his  consent.  Sir Hugh was in an agitation of delight and surprise almost too potent for his  strength. 'The Lord be good unto me,' he cried; 'have I lived to see such a day  as this!' Then, throwing his arms about Edgar's neck, while his eyes were fast  filling with tears, which soon ran plentifully down his cheeks, 'Good young Mr.  Edgar!' he cried; 'good young man! and do you really love my poor Camilla, for  all her not being worth a penny? And will my dear little darling come to so  good an end at last, after being disinherited for doing nothing? And will you  never vex her, nor speak an unkind word to her? Indeed, young Mr. Edgar, you  are a noble boy! you are indeed; and I love you to the bottom of my old heart  for this true good naturedness!'  Then, again and again embracing him, 'This is all of a piece,' he continued,  'with your saving my poor old Rover, which is a thing I shall never forget to  my longest day, being a remarkable sign of a good heart; the poor dog having  done nothing to offend, as we can all testify. So that it's a surprising thing  what that mastiff owed him such a grudge for.'  Then quitting him abruptly to embrace Mr. Tyrold, 'My dear brother,' he cried,  'I hope your judgment approves this thing, as well as my sister's, when she  comes to hear it, which I shall send off express, before I sleep another wink,  for fear of accidents.'  'Approve,' answered Mr. Tyrold, with a look of the most expressive kindness at  Edgar, 'is too cold a word; I rejoice, even thankfully rejoice, to place my  dear child in such worthy and beloved hands.'  'Well, then,' cried the enchanted baronet, 'if that's the case, that we are all  of one mind, we had better settle the business at once, all of us being subject  to die by delay.'  He then rang the bell, and ordered Jacob to summon Camilla to the parlour,  adding, 'And all the rest too, Jacob, for I have something to tell them every  one, which, I make no doubt, they will be very glad to hear, yourself included,  as well as your fellow-servants, who have no right to be left out; only let my  niece come first, being her own affair.'  Camilla obeyed not the call without many secret sensations of distress and  difficulty, but which, mingled with the more obvious ones of modesty and  embarrassment, all passed for a flutter of spirits that appeared natural to the  occasion.  Mr. Tyrold could only silently embrace her: knowing what she had suffered, and  judging thence the excess of her present satisfaction, he would not add to her  confusion by any information of his consciousness; but the softness with which  he held her to his bosom spoke, beyond all words, his heartfelt sympathy in her  happiness.  Camilla had no power to draw herself from his arms; but Edgar hovered round  her, and Sir Hugh repeatedly and impatiently demanded to have his turn. Mr.  Tyrold, gently disengaging himself from her embraces, gave one of her hands to  Edgar, who, with grateful joy, pressed it to his lips. 'My children!' he then  said, laying a hand upon the shoulder of each, 'what a sight is this to me! how  precious a union! what will it be to your excellent mother! So long and so  decidedly it has been our favourite earthly wish, that, were she but restored  to me ... to her country and to her family ... I might, perhaps, require some  new evil to prevent my forgetting where ... and what I am!'  'My dear brother, I say! my dear niece! My dear Mr. young Edgar!' cried Sir  Hugh, in the highest good humour, though with nearly exhausted patience, 'won't  you let me put in a word? nor so much as give you my blessing? though I can  hardly hold life and soul together for the sake of my joy!'  Camilla cast herself into his arms, he kissed her most fondly, saying: 'Don't  forget your poor old uncle, my dear little girl, for the account of this young  Mr. Edgar, because, good as he is, he has taken to you but a short time in  comparison with me.'  'No,' said Edgar, still tenaciously retaining the hand parentally bestowed upon  him; 'no, dear Sir Hugh, I wish not to rob you of your darling. I wish but to  be admitted myself into this dear and respected family, and to have  Etherington, Cleves, and Beech Park, considered as our alternate and common  habitations.'  'You are the very best young man in the whole wide world!' cried Sir Hugh,  almost sobbing with ecstasy; 'for you have hit upon just the very thing I was  thinking of in my own private mind! What a mercy it is our not accepting that  young Captain, who would have run away with her to I don't know where, instead  of being married to the very nearest estate in the county, that will always be  living with us!'  The rest of the family now, obedient to the direction of Jacob, who had  intimated that something extraordinary was going forward, entered the room.  'Come in, come in,' cried Sir Hugh, 'and hear the good news; for we have just  been upon the very point of losing the best opportunity that ever we had in our  lives of all living together; which, I hope, we shall now do, without any more  strangers coming upon us with their company, being a thing we don't desire.'  'But what's the good news, uncle?' said Indiana; 'is it only about our living  together?'  'Why, yes, my dear, that's the first principle, and the other is, that young  Mr. Edgar's going to marry Camilla; which I hope you won't take ill, liking  being all fancy.'  'Me?' cried she, with a disdainful toss of the head, though severely mortified;  'it's nothing to me, I'm sure!'  Camilla ashamed, and Edgar embarrassed, strove now mutually to shew Sir Hugh  they wished no more might be said: but he only embraced them again, and  declared he had never been so full of joy before in his whole life, and would  not be cut short.  Miss Margland, extremely piqued, vented her spleen in oblique sarcasms, and  sought to heal her offended pride by appeals for justice to her sagacity and  foresight in the whole business.  Jacob, now opening the door, said all the servants were come.  Camilla tried to escape; but Sir Hugh would not permit her, and the  house-keeper and butler led the way, followed by every other domestic of the  house.  'Well, my friends,' he cried, 'wish her joy, which I am sure you will do of  your own accord, for she's going to be mistress of Beech Park; which I thought  would have been the case with my other niece, till I found out my mistakes;  which is of no consequence now, all having ended for the best; though unknown  to us poor mortals.'  The servants obeyed with alacrity, and offered their hearty congratulations to  the blushing Camilla and happy Edgar, Molly Mill excepted; who, having  concluded Sir Sedley Clarendel the man, doubted her own senses, and, instead of  open felicitations, whispered Camilla, 'Dear Miss, I've got another letter for  you! It's here in my bosom.'  Camilla, frightened, said: 'Hush! hush!' while Edgar, imagining the girl, whose  simplicity and talkativeness were familiar to him, had said something  ridiculous, entreated to be indulged with hearing her remark: but seeing  Camilla look grave, forbore to press his request.  The baronet now began an harangue upon the happiness that would accrue from  these double unions, for which he assured them they should have double  remembrances, though the same preparations would do for both, as he meant they  should take place at the same time, provided Mr. Edgar would have the  obligingness to wait for a fair wind, which he was expecting every hour.  Camilla could now stay no longer; nor could Edgar, though adoring the hearty  joy of Sir Hugh, refuse to aid her in absconding.  He begged her permission to follow, as soon as it might be possible, which she  tacitly accorded. She was impatient herself for the important conference she  was planning, and felt, with increasing solicitude, that all her life's  happiness hung upon her power to extricate herself honourably from the terrible  embarrassment in which she was involved.  She sauntered about the hall till the servants came out, anxious to receive the  letter which Molly Mill had announced. They all sought to surround her with  fresh good wishes; but she singled out Molly, and begged the rest to leave her  for the present. The letter, however, was not unpinned from the inside of  Molly's neck handkerchief, before Edgar, eager and gay, joined her.  Trembling then, she entreated her to make haste.  'La, Miss,' answered the girl, 'if you hurry me so, I shall tear it as sure as  can be; and what will you say then, Miss?'  'Well ... then ... another time will do ... take it to my room.'  'No, no, Miss; the gentleman told Tommy Hodd he wanted an answer as quick as  can be; he said, if Tommy'd come a-horseback, he'd pay for the horse, to make  him quicker; and Tommy says he always behaves very handsome.'  She then gave her the squeezed billet. Camilla, in great confusion, put it into  her pocket. Edgar, who even unavoidably heard what passed, held back till Molly  retired; and then, with an air of undisguised surprise and curiosity, though in  a laughing tone, said, 'Must not the letter be read till I make my bow?'  'O yes,' ... cried she, stammering, 'it may be read ... at any time.' And she  put her hand in her pocket to reproduce it. But the idea of making known the  strange and unexpected history she had to relate, by shewing so strange a  correspondence, without one leading and softening previous circumstance,  required a force and confidence of which she was not mistress. She twisted it,  therefore, hastily round, to hide the hand-writing of the direction, and, then,  with the same care, rolled it up, and encircled it with her fingers.  'Shall I be jealous?' said he, gently, though disappointed.  'You have much reason!' she answered, with a smile so soft, it dispersed every  fear, yet with an attention so careful to conceal the address, that it kept  alive every wonder. He took her other hand, and kissing it, cried: 'No,  sweetest Camilla, such unworthy distrust shall make no part of our compact. Yet  I own myself a little interested to know what gentleman has obtained a  privilege I should myself prize above almost any other. I will leave you,  however, to read the letter, and, perhaps, before you answer it ... but no ...  I will ask nothing; I shall lose all pleasure in your confidence, if it is not  spontaneous. I will go and find your sisters.'  The first impulse of Camilla was, to commit to him immediately the unopened  letter: but the fear of its contents, its style, its requisitions, made her  terror overpower her generosity; and, though she looked after him with regret,  she stood still to break the seal of her letter.  Miss Camilla Tyrold.  Is it thus, O far too fair tormenter! thou delightest to torture? Dost thou  give wings but to clip them? raise expectation but to bid it linger? fan bright  the flame of hope, but to see it consume in its own ashes? Another delay?...  Ah! tell me how I may exist till it terminates! Name to me, O fair tyrant! some  period, ... or build not upon longer forbearance, but expect me at your feet.  You talk of the Grove: its fair owner is just returned, and calls herself  impatient to see you. To-morrow, then, ... you will not, I trust, kill me again  tomorrow? With the sun, the renovating sun, I will visit those precincts, nor  quit them till warned away by the pale light of Diana: tell me, then, to what  century of that period your ingenious cruelty condemns me to this expiring  state, ere a vivifying smile recalls me back to life?  Sedley Clarendel.  The immediate presence of Edgar himself could not have made this letter dye the  cheeks of Camilla of a deeper red. She saw that Sir Sedley thought her only  coquetishly trifling, and she looked forward with nearly equal horror to  clearing up a mistake that might embitter his future life, and to acknowledging  to Edgar ... the scrupulous, the scrutinising, the delicate Edgar ... that such  a mistake could have been formed.  She was ruminating upon this formidable, this terrible task, when Edgar again  appeared, accompanied by her sisters. She hurried the letter into her pocket.  Edgar saw the action with a concern that dampt his spirits; he wished to obtain  from her immediately the unlimited trust, which immediately, and for ever, he  meant to repose in her. They all strolled together for a short time in the  park; but she was anxious to retreat to her room, and her sisters were dying  with impatience to read Sir Sedley's letter. Edgar, disturbed to see how little  any of their countenances accorded with the happy feelings he had so recently  experienced, proposed not to lengthen the walk, but flattered himself, upon  re-entering the house, Camilla would afford him a few minutes of explanation.  But she only, with a faint smile, said she should soon return to the parlour;  and he saw Molly Mill eagerly waiting for her upon the stairs, and heard her,  in reply to some question concerning Tommy Hodd, desire the girl to be quiet  till she got to her room.  Edgar could form no idea of what all this meant, yet, that some secret  disturbance preyed upon Camilla, that some gentleman wrote to her, and expected  impatiently an answer; and that the correspondence passed neither through her  friends, nor by the post, but by the medium of Molly Mill, were circumstances  not less unaccountable than unpleasant.  Camilla, meanwhile, produced the letter to her sisters, beseeching their ablest  counsel. 'See but,' she cried, 'how dreadfully unprepared is Sir Sedley for the  event of the day! And oh!... how yet more unprepared must be Edgar for seeing  that such a letter could ever be addressed to me! How shall I shew it him, my  dear sisters? how help his believing I must have given every possible  encouragement, ere Sir Sedley could have written to me in so assured a style?'  Much deliberation ensued; but they were all so perplexed, that they were  summoned to tea before they had come to any resolution.  The counsel of Eugenia, then, prevailed; and it was settled, that Camilla  should avoid, for the present, any communication to Edgar, lest it should lead  to mischief between him and the young baronet, who could not but be mutually  displeased with each other; and that the next morning, before she saw Edgar  again, she should set out for the Grove, and there cast herself wholly upon the  generosity of Sir Sedley; and, when freed from all engagement, return, and  relate, without reserve, the whole history to Edgar; who would so soon be  brother of her brother, that he would pardon the faults of Lionel, and who  would then be in no danger himself from personal contest or discussion with Sir  Sedley. She wrote, therefore, one line, to say she would see Mrs. Arlbery early  the next day, and delivered it to Molly Mill; who promised to borrow a horse of  the under-groom, that Tommy Hodd might be back before bed-time, without any  obligation to Sir Sedley.  She, then, went down stairs; when Edgar, disappointed by her long absence,  sought vainly to recompense it by conversing with her. She was gentle, but  seated herself aloof, and avoided his eyes.  His desire to unravel so much mystery he thought now so legitimated by his  peculiar situation, that he was frequently upon the point of soliciting for  information: but, to know himself privileged, upon further reflexion, was  sufficient to insure his forbearance. Even when that knot was tied which would  give to him all power, he sincerely meant to owe all her trust to willing  communication. Should he now, then, make her deem him exacting, and tenacious  of prerogative? no; it might shackle the freedom of her mind in their future  intercourse. He would quietly, therefore, wait her own time, and submit to her  own inclination. She could not doubt his impatience; he would not compel her  generosity.
