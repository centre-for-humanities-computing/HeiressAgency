 A Spectacle  The messenger returned not till midnight; what, then, was the consternation of  Camilla that he brought no answer! She suspected he had not found the house;  she doubted if the letter had been delivered; but he affirmed he had put it  into the hands of a maid-servant, though, as it was late, he had come away  directly, and not thought of waiting for any answer.  It is not very early in life we learn how little is performed, for which no  precaution is taken. Care is the offspring of disappointment; and sorrow and  repentance commonly hang upon its first lessons. Unused to transact any sort of  business for herself, she had expected, in sending a letter, an answer as a  thing of course, and had now only herself to blame for not having ordered him  to stay. She consoled herself, however, that she was known to be but nine miles  distant from the rectory, and that any commands could be conveyed to her nearly  in an hour.  What they might be, became now, therefore, her sole anxiety. Would not her  Mother write? After an avowal such as she had made of her desolate, if not  dying condition, would she not pardon and embrace her? Was it not even possible  she might come herself?  This idea mingled emotions of a contrariety scarcely supportable. 'O how,' she  cried, 'shall I see her? Can joy blend with such terrour? Can I wish her  approach, yet not dare to meet her eye?—that eye which never yet has looked  at me, but to beam with bright kindness!—though a kindness that, even from my  childhood, seemed to say, Camilla, be blameless—or you break your Mother's  heart!... my poor unhappy Mother! she has always seemed to have a presentiment,  I was born to bring her to sorrow!'  Expectation being now, for this night, wholly dead, the excess of her bodily  fatigue urged her to take some repose: but her ever eager imagination made her  apprehensive her friends might find her too well, and suspect her  representation was but to alarm them into returning kindness. A fourth night,  therefore, passed without sleep, or the refreshment of taking off her cloaths;  and by the time the morning sun shone in upon her apartment, she was too  seriously disordered to make her illness require the aid of fancy. She was full  of fever, faint, pallid, weak, and shaken by nervous tremors. 'I think,' she  cried, 'I am now certainly going; and never was death so welcomed by one so  young. It will end in soft peace my brief, but stormy passage, and I shall owe  to its solemn call the sacred blessing of my offended Mother!'  Tranquillised by this hope, and this idea, she now lost all sufferings but  those of disease: her mind grew calm, her spirits serene: all fears gave way to  the certainty of soothing kindness, all grief was buried in the solemnity of  expected dissolution.  But this composure outlived not the first hours of the morning; as they vainly  advanced, producing no loved presence, no letter, no summons; solicitude  revived, disappointment sunk her heart, and dread preyed again upon her nerves.  She started at every sound; every breath of wind seemed portentous; she  listened upon the stairs; she dragged her feeble limbs to the parlour, to be  nearer at hand; she forced them back again to her bed-room, to strain her  aching eyes out of the window; but still no voice demanded her, and no person  approached.  Peggy, who repeatedly came to tell her the hour, now assured her it was dinner  time: unable to eat, she was heedless of the hint this conveyed, and it  obtained from her no orders, till Peggy gave her innocently to understand the  expectations of her host and hostess; but when, at five o'clock, the table was  served, all force and courage forsook her. To be left thus to herself, when her  situation was known; to be abandoned at an inn where she had confessed she  thought herself dying; 'My Mother,' she cried, 'cannot forgive me! my Father  himself deserts me! O Edgar! you did well to fly so unhallowed a connexion!'  She left her dinner for Peggy, and crawling up stairs, cast herself upon the  bed, with a desperate supplication she might rise from it no more. 'The time,'  cried she, 'is past for consolation, and dead for hope! my parents' own prayers  have been averted, and their prognostics fulfilled. May the dread forfeiture,  said my dearest Father, not extend through my daughters!—Alas! Lionel himself  has not brought upon him a disgrace such as I have done!—May Heaven, said my  honoured Mother, spare me evil under your shape at least!—but under that it  has come to her the most heavily!'  Dissolving, then, in sorrowing regret, recollections of maternal tenderness  bathed her pillow with her tears, and reversing all the inducements to her sad  resignation, abolished every wish but to fall again at the parental feet. 'To  see,' cried she, 'once more, the dear authors of my being! to receive their  forgiveness, their blessing ... to view again their honoured countenances!—to  hear once more their loved speech.... Alas! was it I that fled the voice of my  Mother? That voice which, till that moment, had been music to my mind! and  never reached my ear, but as the precursor of all kindness! why did I not  sooner at once kneel at her feet, and seek my lost path under my first and best  guide?'  Shocked and contrite in this tardy view of the step she ought to have taken,  she now languished to petition for pardon even for an offence unknown; and  rising, took up a pen to relate the whole transaction. But her head was  confused, and the attempt shewed her she was more ill than she had even herself  suspected. She thought all rapidly advancing, and enthusiastically rejoiced.  Yet a second time she took the pen; but it had not touched the paper, when a  buzzing, confused, stifled sort of noise from without drew her to the window.  She then perceived an immense crowd of people approaching slowly, and from a  distance, towards the inn.  As they advanced, she was struck to hear no encrease of noise, save from the  nearer trampling of feet. No voice was distinguishable; no one spoke louder  than the rest; they seemed even to tread the ground with caution. They  consisted of labourers, workmen, beggars, women, and children, joined by some  accidental passengers: yet the general 'hum of many' was all that was heard;  they were silent though numerous, solemn though mixt.  As they came near, she thought she perceived something in the midst of them  like a bier, and caught a glimpse of a gentleman's habit. Startled, she drew  in; but soon, upon another view, discerned clearly a well-dressed man,  stretched out his full length, and apparently dead.  Recoiling, shuddering, she hastily shut the window, 'Yet why,' she cried, the  next moment, 'and whence this emotion? Is not death what I am  meeting?—seeking?—desiring?—what I court? what I pray for?'  She sighed, walked feebly up and down the room, breathed hard and with effort,  and then forced herself again to open the window, determined to contemplate  steadily the anticipating object of her fervent demand.  Yet not without severe self-compulsion she flung up again the sash; but when  she looked out, the crowd alone remained; the bier was gone.  Whether carried on, or brought into the house, she now wished to know, with  some particulars, of whom it might be, and what belonged to so strange and  horrible an appearance.  She rang for little Peggy; but Peggy came not. She rang again, but no one  answered the bell. She opened her door, meaning to descend to her little  parlour for information; but the murmuring buzz she had before heard upon the  road, was now within the house, which seemed filled with people, all busy and  occupied, yet speaking low, and appearing to partake of a general awe.  She could not venture to encounter so many spectators; she shut her door, to  wait quietly till this first commotion should be passed.  This was not for more than an hour; when observing, from her window, that the  crowd was dispersed, she again listened at the door, and found that the general  disturbance was succeeded by a stillness the most profound.  She then rang again, and little Peggy appeared, but looking pale and much  frightened.  Camilla asked what had been the matter.  'O ma'am,' she answered, crying, 'here's been murder! A gentleman has been  murdered—and nobody knows who he is, nor who has done it!'  She then related that he had been found dead in a wood hard by, and one person  calling another, and another, he had been brought to the inn to be owned.  'And is he here now?' with an involuntary shudder asked Camilla.  Yes, she answered, but her mistress had ordered her not to own it, for fear of  frightening the young lady; and said he would soon be carried away.  The tale was shocking, and, though scarce conscious why, Camilla desired Peggy  to stay with her.  The little girl was most willing; but she was presently called down stairs; and  Camilla, with strong shame of nameless fears and weak horrour, strove to  meditate to some use upon this scene.  But her mind was disturbed, her composure was gone; her thoughts were broken,  abrupt, unfixed, and all upon which she could dwell with any steadiness, was  the desire of one more appeal to her family, that yet they would consent to see  her, if they received it in time; or that they should know in what frame of  mind she expired, should it bring them too late.  With infinite difficulty, she then wrote the following lines; every bending  down of her head making it ache nearly to distraction.  'Adieu, my dearest parents, if again it is denied me to see you! Adieu, my  darling sisters! my tender uncle! I ask not now your forgiveness; I know I  shall possess it fully; my Father never withheld it,—and my Mother, if  against herself alone I had sinned, would have been equally lenient; would have  probed but to heal, have corrected, but to pardon. O tenderest of united  partners! bless, then, the early ashes of your erring, but adoring daughter,  who, from the moment she inflicted one wound upon your bosoms, has found  existence intolerable, and prays now but for her earthly release!  'Camilla Tyrold.'  This she gave to Peggy, with a charge that, at any expence, it might be  conveyed to the rectory at Etherington immediately.  'And shall I not,' thought she, when she had rested from this exertion, 'and  may I not at such a period, with innocence, with propriety, write one poor word  to him who was so near becoming first to me in all things?'  She again took her pen, but had only written 'O Edgar! in this last farewell be  all displeasure forgotten!—from the first to the final moment of my short  life, dear and sole possessor of my heart!'—when the shooting anguish of her  head stopt her hand, and hastily writing the direction, lest she could write no  more, she, with difficulty added, 'Not to be delivered till I am dead;' and was  forced to lie down, and shut all light from her strained and aching eyes.  Peggy presently brought her word that all the horses were out, and every body  was engaged, and that the note could not possibly go till the next day.  Extremely disappointed, she begged to speak with Mrs. Marl; who sent her word  she was much engaged, but would wait upon her as soon as she was able.  Vainly, however, she expected her; it grew dusk; she felt herself worse every  moment; flushed with fever, or shivering with cold, and her head nearly split  asunder with agony. She determined to go once more down stairs, and offer to  her host himself any reward he could claim, so he would undertake the immediate  delivery of the letter.  With difficulty she arose; with slow steps, and tottering, she descended; but  as she approached her little parlour, she heard voices in it, and stopt. They  spoke low, and she could not distinguish them. The door of an adjoining room  was open, and by its stillness empty; she resolved to ring there, to demand to  speak with Mr. Marl. But as she dragged her weak limbs into the apartment, she  saw, stretched out upon a large table, the same form, dress, and figure she had  seen upon the bier.  Starting, almost fainting, but too much awed to call out, she held trembling by  the door.  The bodily feebleness which impeded her immediate retreat, gave force to a  little mental reflexion: Do I shrink thus, thought she, from what so earnestly  I have prayed to become ... and so soon I must represent ... a picture of death?  She now impelled herself towards the table. A cloth covered the face; she stood  still, hesitating if she had power to remove it: but she thought it a call to  her own self-examination; and though mentally recoiling, advanced. When close  to the table, she stood still, violently trembling. Yet she would not allow  herself to retreat. She now put forth her hand; but it shook suspended over the  linen, without courage to draw it aside. At length, however, with enthusiastic  self-compulsion, slightly and fearfully, she lifted it up ... but instantly,  and with instinctive horrour, snatched her hand away, and placed it before her  shut eyes.  She felt, now, she had tried herself beyond her courage, and, deeply moved, was  fain to retreat; but in letting down her hand, to see her way, she found she  had already removed the linen from a part of the face, and the view she  unintentionally caught almost petrified her.  For some instants she stood motionless, from want of strength to stir, but with  closed eyes, that feared to confirm their first surmise; but when, turning from  the ghastly visage, she attempted, without another glance, to glide away, an  unavoidable view of the coat, which suddenly she recognized, put her conjecture  beyond all doubt, that she now saw dead before her the husband of her sister.  Resentment, in gentle minds, however merited and provoked, survives not the  breath of the offender. With the certainty no further evil can be practised,  perishes vengeance against the culprit, though not hatred of the guilt: and  though, with the first movement of sisterly feelings, she would have said, Is  Eugenia then released? the awe was too great, his own change was too solemn. He  was now where no human eye could follow, no human judgment overtake him.  Again she endeavoured to escape the dreadful scene, but her shaking limbs were  refractory, and would not support her. The mortal being requires use to be  reconciled to its own visible mortality; dismal is its view; grim, repulsive,  terrific its aspect.  But no sooner was her head turned from the dire object, than alarm for her  sister took possession of her soul; and with what recollection she possessed,  she determined to go to Belfont.  An idea of any active service invigorates the body as well as the mind. She  made another effort to depart, but a glance she knew not how to avoid shewed  her, upon the coat of the right arm and right side of this ghastly figure,  large splashes of blood.  With horrour thus accumulate, she now sunk upon the floor, inwardly exclaiming:  He is murdered indeed!... and where may be Eugenia?  A woman who had in charge to watch by the corpse, but who had privately stolen  out for some refreshment, now returning, saw with affright the new person in  the room, and ran to call Mrs. Marl; who, alarmed also at the sight of the  young lady, and at her deplorable condition, assisted the woman to remove her  from the apartment, and convey her to the chamber, where she was laid down upon  the bed, though she resisted being undressed, and was seized with an aguish  shivering fit, while her eyes seemed emitting sparks of fire.  'It is certainly now,' cried she, 'over, and hence I move no more!'  The joy with which, a few minutes before, she would have welcomed such a  belief, was now converted into an awe unspeakable, undefinable. The wish of  death is commonly but disgust of life, and looks forward to nothing further  than release from worldly care:—but the something yet beyond ... the  something unknown, untried, yet to come, the bourne whence no traveller returns  to prepare succeeding passengers for what they may expect, now abruptly  presented itself to her consideration, ... but came to scare, not to soothe.  All here, she cried, I have wished to leave ... but ... have I fitted myself  for what I am to meet?  Conscience now suddenly took the reins from the hands of imagination, and a  mist was cleared away that hitherto, obscuring every duty by despondence, had  hidden from her own perceptions the faulty basis of her desire. Conscience took  the reins—and a mist was cleared away that had concealed from her view the  cruelty of this egotism.  Those friends, it cried, which thus impatiently thou seekest to quit, have they  not loved, cherished, reared thee with the most exquisite care and kindness? If  they are offended, who has offended them? If thou art now abandoned, may it not  be from necessity, or from accident? When thou hast inflicted upon them the  severe pain of harbouring anger against what is so dear to them, wouldst thou  load them with regret that they manifested any sensibility of thy errours? Hast  thou plunged thy house in calamity, and will no worthier wish occur to thee,  than to leave it to its sorrows and distress, with the aggravating pangs of  causing thy afflicting, however blamable self-desertion? of coming to thee ...  perhaps even now!... with mild forgiveness, and finding thee a self-devoted  corpse?—not fallen, indeed, by the profane hand of daring suicide, but  equally self-murdered through wilful self-neglect.  Had the voice been allowed sound which spoke this dire admonition, it could  scarcely with more horrour, or keener repentance have struck her. 'That poor  man,' she cried, 'now delivering up his account, by whatever hand he perished,  since less principled, less instructed than myself, may be criminal, perhaps,  with less guilt!'  The thought now of her Father,—the piety he had striven to inculcate into her  mind; his resignation to misfortune, and his trust through every suffering, all  came home to her heart, with religious veneration; and making prayer succeed to  remorse, guided her to what she knew would be his guidance if present, and she  desired to hear the service for the sick.  Peggy could not read; Mrs. Marl was too much engaged; the whole house had ample  employment, and her request was unattainable.  She then begged they would procure her a prayer-book, that she might try to  read herself; but her eyes, heavy, aching, and dim, glared upon the paper,  without distinguishing the print from the margin.  'I am worse!' she cried faintly, 'my wish comes fast upon me! Ah! not for my  punishment let it finally arrive!'  With terror, however, even more than with malady, she now trembled. The  horrible sight she had witnessed, brought death before her in a new view. She  feared she had been presumptuous; she felt that her preparations had all been  worldly, her impatience wholly selfish. She called back her wish, with  penitence and affright: her agitation became torture, her regret was aggravated  to remorse, her grief to despair.
