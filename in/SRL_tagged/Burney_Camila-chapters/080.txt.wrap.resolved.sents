 Dilemmas  While the baronet was pondering, in the most melancholy manner, upon this  sudden and unexpected demand of absence in Camilla, the grim goddess of Envy  took possession of the fine features of Indiana; who declared the baronet was immured  alive, while the baronet cousin went everywhere.
The curiosity of Lynmere being  excited, to inquire what was to be had or done at Southampton, her cousin heard it  abounded in good company, and good fish, and protested her cousin must undoubtedly set  out for it the next morning.
Indiana then wept with vexation and anger, and Miss Margland affirmed, Miss Margland was  the only young lady in Hampshire, who had never been at Southampton.
Sir Hugh,  concluding Edgar would attend Camilla, feared it might hurt the other match to  part Eugenia from Clermont; and, after a little pause, though deeply sighing at  such a dispersion from Cleves, consented that deeply sighing at  such a dispersion from Cleves should all go together.
Camilla, therefore, was commissioned to ask leave of Mr. Tyrold for Eugenia, as  well as for Miss Margland, and to add a petition from Sir Hugh, that Sir Hugh and Lavinia  would spend the time of he and Lavinia   absence at Cleves.
The baronet then, of Cleves own  accord, asked Dr. Orkborne to be of the party, that Eugenia, Dr. Orkborne said, might run  over Dr. Orkborne lessons with Dr. Orkborne in a morning, for fear of forgetting them.
A breach, however, such as this, of plans so long formed, and a desertion so  voluntary of his house, at the very epoch his had settled for rendering his house  residence the most desirable, sent his in complete discomfiture to his bed.
But  there, in a few hours, his sanguine temper, and the kindness of his heart new  modelled and new coloured the circumstances of his chagrin.
his considered his  should have full time to prepare for the double marriages; and that, with the  aid of Lavinia, his might delight and amaze them all, with new dresses and new  trinkets, which his could now choose without the torment of continual opposition  from the documentising Miss Margland.
Thus his restored his plastic mind to his plastic mind  usual satisfaction, and arose the next morning without a cloud upon his brow.
The pure design of benevolence is to bestow happiness upon others, but The pure design of benevolence  intrinsic reward is bringing happiness home!
But this sweetness of nature, so aptly supplying the first calls, and the first  virtues of philosophy, was yet more severely again tried the next morning: for  when, forgetting the caution he had solemnly promised, but vainly endeavoured  to observe, he intimated to Lynmere these purposes, the youth, blushing at the  idea of being taken for the destined husband of Eugenia in public, preferred  all risks to being followed by such a rumour to Southampton; and, when he found  she was to be of the party, positively declared the match to be out of all  question.
Sir Hugh now stood aghast.
Many had been Sir Hugh disappointments; Sir Hugh rage for  forming schemes, and Sir Hugh credulity in persuading Sir Hugh they would be  successful, were sources not more fertile of amusement in they projection,  than of mortification in they event: but here, the length of time since Sir Hugh  plan had been arranged, joined to the very superficial view Sir Hugh had taken of any  chance of his  plan failure, had made Sir Hugh, by degrees, regard his  plan as so fixed and  settled, that his  plan rather demanded congratulation than concurrence, rather waited  to be enjoyed than executed.
Lynmere took not the smallest interest in the dismay of Lynmere uncle, but, turning  upon Lynmere heel, said Lynmere would go to the stables, to see if Lynmere could find  something that would carry Lynmere any better than the miserable jade Lynmere had  mounted the preceding evening.
Sir Hugh remained in a kind of stupefaction.
Sir Hugh seemed to Sir Hugh to be bereft  of every purpose of life; and robbed at once, of all view for Sir Hugh actions, all  subject for Sir Hugh thoughts.
The wide world, Sir Hugh believed, had never, hitherto,  given birth to a plan so sagaciously conceived, so rationally combined, so  infallibly secure: yet it was fallen, crushed, rejected!
A gleam of sunshine, however, ere long, [burst] upon his despondence; it  occurred to Sir Hugh, that the learned education of Eugenia was still a secret to  Eugenia cousin; the learned education of Eugenia was still a secret to  her cousin whole scheme, therefore, might perhaps yet be retrieved, when  Lynmere should be informed of the peculiar preparations made for Lynmere conjugal  happiness.
Fetching now a long breath, to aid the revival of Lynmere faculties and Lynmere  spirits, Lynmere considered how to open Lynmere discourse so as to render his discourse most  impressive, and then sent for Clermont to attend Lynmere in Lynmere chamber.
'Nephew,' cried Lynmere, upon Lynmere entrance, 'I am now going to talk to you a little  in your own way, having something to tell you of, that, I believe, you won't  know how to hold cheap, being a thing that belongs to your studies; that is to  say, to  her cousin's; which, I hope, is pretty much the same thing, at least  as to the end.
Now the case of what I have to say is this; you must know,  nephew, I had always set my heart upon having a rich heir; but it's what did  not turn out, which I am sorry enough for; but where's the man that's so wise  as to know nephew own doom?
that is, the doom of nephew fortune.
However, that's what  I should not talk of to you, having so little; which, I hope, you won't take to  heart.
And, indeed, it in't much worth a wise man's thinking of, when he han't  got when he han't  , for what's a fortune, at bottom, but mere metal?
And so having, as I  said before, no heir, I'm forced, in default of no heir, to take up with an heiress.
But, to the end of making all parties happy, I've had an heiress brought up in the  style of a boy, for the sake of your marrying an heiress.
For which reason, I believe,  in point of the classics....'  'Me, sir!'
cried Lynmere, recovering from a long yawning fit, 'and what have I  to do with marrying a girl like a boy?
That's not my taste, sir, I  assure you.
Besides, what has a wife to do with the classics?
will a wife to do with the classics shew  a wife to do with the classics how to order a wife to do with the classics table?
I suppose when I want to eat, I may go to a cook's  shop!'
Here subsided, at once, every particle of that reverence sir had so long  nourished for Lynmere.
To hear the classics spoken of with disrespect,  after all the pains sir had taken, all the orders sir had given for their  exclusive study and veneration, and to find the common calls of life, which sir  had believed every scholar regarded but as means of existence, not auxiliaries  of happiness, named with preference, distanced, at a stroke, all high opinion  of sir nephew, and made way, in its stead, for a displeasure not wholly free  from disdain.
'Well, Clermont,' said he, after a pause, 'I won't keep you any longer, now I  know your mind, which I wish I had known before, for the account of your  cousin, who has had plague enough about plague in her bringing up; which, however,  I shall put an end to now, not seeing that any good has come from plague.'
Lynmere joyfully accepted the permission to retire, enchanted that the  rejection was thus completely off Lynmere mind, and had incurred only so slight a  reproof, unaccompanied with one menace, or even remonstrance.
The first consternation of Sir Hugh, at the fall of this favourite project,  was, indeed, somewhat lessened, at this moment, by the fall of Sir Hugh respectful  opinion of its principal object.
Sir Hugh sent therefore, hastily, for Eugenia, to  whom Sir Hugh abruptly exclaimed, 'My dear girl, who'd have thought it?
here's your  cousin Clermont, with all his Greek and Latin, which I begin to bless God I  don't know a word of, turning out a mere common nothing, thinking about Sir Hugh  dinners and suppers!
for which reason I beg you'll think of Sir Hugh no more, it not  being worth your while; in particular, as Sir Hugh don't desire it.'
Eugenia, at this intimation, felt nearly as much relieved as disturbed.
To be  refused was, indeed, shocking; not to Eugenia pride, Eugenia was a stranger to that  passion; but to Eugenia delicacy, which pointed out to Eugenia, in strong colours, the  impropriety of having been exposed to such a decision: nevertheless, to find  Eugenia unshackled from an alliance to which Eugenia looked forward with dread,  without offending Eugenia uncle, to whom so many reasons made it dear, or  militating against Eugenia own heroic sentiments of generosity, which revolted  against wilfully depriving Eugenia cousin of an inheritance already offered to her uncle,  removed a weight from Eugenia mind, which her uncle every word, look, and gesture, had  contributed to increase since their first meeting.
Dr. Marchmont had ridden to Beech Park, where Dr. Marchmont had spent the night, though  uninvited by Dr. Marchmont agitated owner, whom the very name of Mrs. Berlinton, annexed  to an accepted party of pleasure, had driven, in speechless agony, from Cleves.
'I wonder not,' cried Dr. Marchmont, 'at your disturbance; I feel for it, on the contrary,  more than ever, from my observations of this evening; for I now see the charm,  the potent charm, as well as the difficulties of your situation.
This strange  affair with Sir Sedley Clarendel cannot, in common foresight of what may ensue  from This strange  affair with Sir Sedley Clarendel, be passed over without the most rigid scrutiny, and severest  deliberation; yet, I sincerely hope, inquiry may produce some palliation: this  young lady, I see, will not easily, for sweetness, for countenance, for every  apparent attraction, be replaced: and, the first of all requisites is certainly  in your favour; it is evident she loves you.'
'Loves me?'
cried Edgar, Edgar arms involuntarily encircling Edgar as Edgar repeated  the magnetising words: 'Ah!
Dr. Marchmont, could Dr. Marchmont then thus grieve and defy  me?—And yet, so too said Jacob,—that good, faithful, excellent old  servant....'  'Yes; I watched Dr. Marchmont unremittingly; and saw Dr. Marchmont so much hurt by your abrupt  retreat, that Dr. Marchmont eyes filled with tears the moment you left the room.'
'O, Dr. Marchmont!—and for Dr. Marchmont were 'O, Dr. Marchmont!—and for me shed?—my dear—dear friend!
withhold from Dr. Marchmont such a picture—or reconcile me completely to viewing no  other!'
'Once more, let me warn you to circumspection.
The stake for which you are  playing is life in The stake for which you are  playing best part, 'tis peace of mind.
That Dr. Marchmont manners are  engaging, that Dr. Marchmont looks are captivating, and even that Dr. Marchmont heart is yours,  admit no doubt: but the solidity or the lightness of that heart are yet to be  proved.'
'Still, Doctor, though nearly in defiance of all my senses, still I can doubt  anything rather than the heart of Camilla!
Precipitate, I know, Dr. Marchmont has always  been reckoned; but Dr. Marchmont precipitance is of kin to Dr. Marchmont noblest virtues; it  springs but from the unsuspicious frankness of an unguarded, because innocent  nature.
And this, in a short time, Dr. Marchmont understanding will correct.'
'Are you sure it is adequate to the task?
There is often, in early youth, a  quickness of parts which raises expectations that are never realised.
Their  origin is but in the animal spirits, which, instead of ripening into judgment  and sense by added years, dwindle into nothingness, or harden into flippancy.
The character, at this period, is often so unstable, as to be completely new  moulded by every new accident, or new associate.
How innumerable are the  lurking ill qualities that may lie dormant beneath the smiles of youth and  beauty, in the season of their untried serenity!
The contemporaries of half our  fiercest viragos of fifty, may assure you that, at fifteen, The contemporaries of half our   were all  softness and sweetness.
The present æra, however, my dear young friend, is  highly favourable to all you can judiciously wish; namely, the entire  re-establishment, or total destruction of all confidence.... To a man of your  nice feelings, there is no medium.
Your love demands respect, or your  tranquillity exacts flight from Your love object.
Set apart your offence at the  cultivation of an acquaintance you disapprove; be yourself of the party to  Southampton, and there, a very little observation will enable you to dive into  the most secret recesses of   .'
'Steadiness, Doctor, I do not want, nor yet, however I suffer from the party  exertion, fortitude: but a plan such as this, requires something more; the party calls  for an equivocal conduct, which, to me, would be impracticable, and to  ,  might prove delusive.
No!...
the openness I so much pine to meet with, I must,  at least, not forfeit me.'
'The fervour of your integrity, my dear Mandlebert, mistakes caution for  deceit.
If, indeed, a plan such as this had any other view than your union, a plan such as this would not  merely be cruel, but infamous: the truth, however, is you must either pursue  her upon proof, or abandon her at once, with every chance of repenting such a  measure.'
'Alas!
how torturing is hesitation!
to believe me the object of her regard  ... to think that first of all human felicities mine, yet to find it so pliant  ... so precarious ... to see her, with such thoughtless readiness, upon the  point of falling into the hands of another!...
receiving ... answering ... his  letters!...
letters too so confident, so daring!
made up of insolent demands  and imperious reproaches ... to meet his by his own appointment.... O, Dr.  Marchmont!
all delicious as is the idea of her preference ... all entwined as  her is around my soul, how, now, how ever again, can I be happy, either to quit  ... or to claim her?...'
'This division of sentiment is what gives rise to a plan such as this.
At  Southampton, you  will see if Sir Sedley pursues Sir Sedley; and, as Sir Sedley will be uncertain of your  intentions, you will be enabled to judge the singleness of Sir Sedley mind, and the  stability of Sir Sedley affection, by the reception Sir Sedley gives Sir Sedley.'
'But if ... as I think I can gather from Sir Sedley delivering me Sir Sedley letters, the  affair, whatever it has been, with Sir Sedley, is over.... What then?'
'You will have leisure to discuss it; and opportunity, also, to see Sir Sedley with  other Sir Sedleys.
Public places abound with those flutterers after youth and  beauty; unmeaning admirers, who sigh at every new face; or black traitors to  society, who seek but to try, and try but to publish their own power of  conquest.'
'Will you, then, my dear Doctor, be also of the party?
for my sake, will you,  once more, quit your studies and repose, to give me, upon the spot, your  counsel, according to the varying exigence of varying circumstances?
to aid me  to prepare and compose my mind for whatever may be the event, and to guide  even, if possible, my wavering and distracted thoughts?'
To the importance of the period, and to a plea so serious, every obstacle  yielded, and Dr. Marchmont agreed to accompany him to  Southampton.
