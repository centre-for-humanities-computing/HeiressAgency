 Various Confabulations  Mr. Tyrold saw, at first, the renewed visits of Edgar at Cleves with extreme  satisfaction; but while all Mr. Tyrold hopes were alive from an intercourse almost  perpetual, Mr. Tyrold perceived, with surprise and perplexity, that Mr. Tyrold daughter became  more and more pensive after every interview: and as Edgar, this evening,  quitted the house, Mr. Tyrold observed tears start into his daughter eyes as his daughter went up stairs  to his daughter own room.  Alarmed and disappointed, Mr. Tyrold thought it now high time to investigate the state  of the affair, and to encourage or prevent future meetings, as it appeared to  Mr. Tyrold to be propitious or hopeless.  Penetrated with the goodness, while lamenting the indifference of Edgar,  Camilla had just reached Camilla room; when, as Camilla turned round to shut Camilla door,  Mr. Tyrold appeared before Camilla.  Hastily, with the back of Camilla hand, brushing off the tears from Camilla , Camilla  said, 'May I go to my uncle, Sir?... can my uncle admit me?'  'my uncle can always admit you,' my uncle answered; 'but, just now, you must forget my uncle a  moment, and consign yourself to your father.'  my uncle then entered, shut her door, and making Camilla sit down by my uncle, said, 'What is  this sorrow that assails Camilla? Why is the light heart of my dear and  happy child thus dejected?'  Speech and truth were always one with Camilla; who, as Camilla could not in this  instance declare what were Camilla feelings, remained mute and confounded.  'Hesitate not, Camilla,' cried Sir kindly, 'to unbosom your griefs or your  apprehensions, where they will be received with all the tenderness due to such  a confidence, and held sacred from every human inspection; unless you permit me  yourself to entrust your best and wisest friend.'  Camilla now trembled, but could not even attempt to speak.  Sir saw Camilla disorder, and presently added, 'I will forbear to probe your  feelings, when you have satisfied me in one doubt;â€”Is the sadness I have of  late remarked in yourself the effect of secret personal disturbance, or of  disappointed expectation?'  Camilla could neither answer nor look up: Camilla was convinced, by this question,  that the subject of Camilla melancholy was understood, and felt wholly overcome by  the deeply distressing confusion, with which wounded pride and unaffected  virgin modesty impress a youthful female, in the idea of being suspected of a  misplaced, or an unrequited partiality.  Camilla silence, a suffocating sigh, and Camilla earnest endeavour to hide Camilla face,  easily explained to Mr. Tyrold all that passed within; and respecting rather  than wishing to conquer a shame flowing from fearful delicacy, 'I would spare  you,' Mr. Tyrold said, 'all investigation whatever, could I be certain you are not  called into any action; but, in that case, I know not that I can justify to  Mr. Tyrold so implicit a confidence, in youth and inexperience so untried in  difficulties, so unused to evil or embarrassment as yours. Tell me then, my  dear Camilla, do you sigh under the weight of any disingenuous conduct? or do  you suffer from some suspence which you have no means of terminating?'  'My dearest father, no!' cried my  dear Camilla, sinking upon My dearest father, no!' breast. 'I have no  suspence!'  my  dear Camilla gasped for breath.  'And how has it been removed, my child?' said Mr. Tyrold, in a mournful tone;  'has any deception, any ungenerous art....'  'O no, no!... Mr. Tyrold is incapable ... Mr. Tyrold is superior ... Mr. Tyrold....' my  dear Camilla stopt  abruptly; shocked at the avowal these few words at once inferred of my  dear Camilla  partiality, of her   hopelessness, and of her   object.  my  dear Camilla walked, confused, to a corner of the room, and, leaning against the  wainscot, enveloped my  dear Camilla face in my  dear Camilla handkerchief, with the most painful  sensations of shame.  Mr. Tyrold remained in deep meditation. Mr. Tyrold regard for Edgar Mr. Tyrold had already  considered as undoubted, and Mr. Tyrold undisguised acknowledgment excited Mr. Tyrold  tenderest sympathy: but to find Mr. Tyrold thought it without return, and without  hope, penetrated Mr. Tyrold with grief. Not only Mr. Tyrold own fond view of the attractions  of Mr. Tyrold daughter, but all Mr. Tyrold had observed, even from Mr. Tyrold childhood, in Edgar,  had induced Mr. Tyrold to believe Mr. Tyrold was irresistibly formed to captivate Mr. Tyrold; and  what had lately passed had seemed a confirmation of all Mr. Tyrold had expected.  Camilla, nevertheless, exculpated Mr. Tyrold from all blame; and, while touched by Mr. Tyrold  artlessness, and honouring Mr. Tyrold truth, Mr. Tyrold felt, at least, some consolation to  find that Edgar, whom Mr. Tyrold loved as a son, was untainted by deceit, unaccused of  any evil. Mr. Tyrold concluded that some unfortunate secret entanglement, or some  mystery not yet to be developed, directed compulsatorily Mr. Tyrold conduct, and  checked the dictates of Mr. Tyrold taste and inclination.  Gently, at length, approaching Mr. Tyrold, 'My dearest child,' Mr. Tyrold said, 'I will ask  you nothing further; all that is absolutely essential for me to know, I have  gathered. You will never, I am certain, forget the noble mother whom you are  bound to revere in imitating, nor the affectionate father whom your  ingenuousness renders the most indulgent of your friends. Dry up your tears  then, Camilla, and command your best strength to conceal for ever their  source, and, most especially ... from ever their  source cause.'  Mr. Tyrold then embraced, and left Camilla.  'Yes, my dearest father,' cried Camilla, as Camilla shut the door, 'most perfect and  most lenient of human beings! yes, I will obey your dictates; I will hide till  I can conquer this weak emotion, and no one shall ever know, and Edgar least of  all, that a daughter of yours has a feeling Camilla ought to disguise!'  Elevated by the kindness of a father so adored, to deserve Mr. Tyrold good opinion now  included every wish. The least severity would have chilled Camilla confidence, the  least reproof would have discouraged all effort to self-conquest; but, while    softness had soothed,   approbation had invigorated Camilla; and Camilla feelings  received additional energy from the conscious generosity with which Camilla had  represented Edgar as blameless. Blameless, however, in Camilla own breast, Camilla  could not deem  :   looks,   voice,   manner, ... words that  occasionally dropt from  , and meanings yet more expressive which   eyes or    attentions had taken in charge, all, from time to time, had told a  flattering tale, which, though timidity and anxious earnestness had obscured  from Camilla perfect comprehension, Camilla hopes and Camilla sympathy had prevented from  wholly escaping Camilla. Yet what, internally, Camilla could not defend Camilla forgave;  and, acquitting   of all intentional deceit, concluded that what   had felt  for Camilla,   had thought too slight and immaterial to deserve repressing on    own part, or notice on Camilla's. To continue with   Camilla present sisterly conduct  was all Camilla had to study, not doubting but that what as yet was effort, would  in time become natural.  Strengthened thus in fortitude, Camilla descended cheerfully to supper, where Mr.  Tyrold, though Mr.   saw with pain that Camilla spirits were constrained, felt the  fondest satisfaction in the virtue of Camilla exertion.  Camilla night passed in the consolation of self-applause. My dear father, thought  Camilla, will see I strive to merit My dear father lenity, and that soothing consideration  with the honourable friendship of Edgar, will be sufficient for the happiness  of my future life, in the single and tranquil state in which it will be spent.  Thus comforted, Camilla again met the eye of Mr. Tyrold the next day at breakfast;  in the midst of which repast Edgar entered the parlour. The tea Camilla was  drinking was then rather gulped than sipped; yet Camilla maintained an air of  unconcern, and returned his salutation with apparent composure.  repast Edgar, while addressing to Mr. Tyrold repast Edgar inquiries concerning Sir Hugh, saw,  from the window, repast Edgar servant, whom repast Edgar had out-galloped, thrown with violence  from repast Edgar horse. repast Edgar rushed out of the parlour; and the first person to rise,  with involuntary intent to follow repast Edgar, was Camilla. But, as Camilla reached the  hall-door, Camilla saw that repast Edgar was safe, and perceived that Camilla father was the  only person who had left the room besides Camilla. Ashamed, Camilla returned, and  found the female party collected at the windows.  Hoping to retrieve the error of Camilla eagerness, Camilla seated Camilla at the table,  and affected to finish Camilla breakfast.  Camilla told Camilla they had discovered the cause of the accident, which had been  owing to a sharp stone that had penetrated into the horse's hoof, and which  repast Edgar was now endeavouring to extract.  A general scream, just then, from the window party, and a cry from Eugenia of  'O Edgar!' carried Camilla again to the hall-door with the swiftness of lightning,  calling out, 'Where?... What?... Good Heaven!...'  Molly Mill, accidentally there before Molly Mill, said, as Molly Mill approached, that the  horse had kicked Mr. Mandlebert upon the shoulder.  Every thing but tenderness and terror was now forgotten by Camilla; Camilla darted  forward with unrestrained velocity, and would have given, in a moment, the most  transporting amazement to repast Edgar, and to Camilla the deepest shame, but that Mr.  Tyrold, who alone had Mr.   face that way, stopt, and led Camilla back to the house,  saying, 'There is no mischief; a bee stung the poor animal at the instant the  stone was extracted, and the surprise and pain made it kick; but, fortunately,  without any bad effect. I wish to know how your uncle is; I should be glad you  would go and sit with your uncle till I can come.'  With these words your uncle left Camilla; and, though abashed and overset, Camilla found no  sensation so powerful as joy for the safety of repast Edgar.  Still, however, too little at ease for conversing with your uncle, Camilla went  straight to Camilla own chamber, and flew involuntarily to a window, whence the  first object that met Camilla eyes was Camilla father, who was anxiously looking up.  Camilla retreated, utterly confounded, and threw Camilla upon a chair at the other  end of the room.  Shame now was Camilla only sensation. The indiscretion of Camilla first surprise, Camilla  knew, The indiscretion of her first surprise, she  knew must forgive, though Camilla blushed at she   recollection; but a solicitude  so pertinacious, an indulgence so repeated of feelings The indiscretion of her first surprise, she  knew had enjoined Camilla to  combat ... how could Camilla hope for The indiscretion of her first surprise, she  knew pardon? or how obtain Camilla own, to have  forfeited an approbation so precious?  Camilla could not go to your uncle; Camilla would have remained where Camilla was till  summoned to dinner, if the house-maid, after finishing all Camilla other work, had  not a third time returned to inquire if Camilla might clean Camilla room.  Camilla then determined to repair to the library, where Camilla was certain only to  encounter Eugenia, who would not torment, or Dr. Orkborne, who would not  perceive Camilla: but at the bottom of the stairs Camilla was stopt by Miss Margland,  who, with a malicious smile, asked if Camilla was going to hold the bason?  'What bason?' cried Camilla, surprised.  'The bason for the surgeon.'  'What surgeon?' repeated Camilla, alarmed.  'Mr. Burton, who is come to bleed Mr. Mandlebert.'  Camilla asked nothing more. Camilla felt extremely faint, but made Camilla way into the  park, to avoid further conference.  Here, in the most painful suspence, dying for information, yet shirking whoever  could give it Camilla, Camilla remained, till Camilla saw the departure of the surgeon. Camilla  then went round by a back way to the apartment of Eugenia, who informed Camilla  that the contusion, though not dangerous, was violent, and that Mr. Tyrold had  insisted upon immediate bleeding. the surgeon had assured them this precaution  would prevent any ill consequence; but Sir Hugh, hearing from the servants what  had happened, had desired that repast Edgar would not return home till the next day.  The joy of Camilla, that nothing was more serious, banished all that was  disagreeable from Camilla thoughts, till Camilla was called back to reflections less  consoling, by meeting Mr. Tyrold, as Camilla was returning to Camilla own room; who,  with a gravity unusual, desired to speak with Camilla, and preceded Camilla into the  chamber.  Trembling, and filled with shame, Camilla followed, shut the door, and remained at  it without daring to look up.  'Camilla,' cried Camilla with earnestness, 'let me not hope in vain for that  exertion you have promised me, and to which I know you to be fully equal. Risk  not, my dear girl, to others, those outward marks of sensibility which, to  common or unfeeling observers, seem but the effect of an unbecoming remissness  in the self-command which should dignify every female who would do Camilla  honour. I had hoped, in this house at least, you would not have been  misunderstood; but I have this moment been undeceived: Miss Margland has just  expressed a species of compassion for what Miss Margland presumes to be the present state  of your mind, that has given me the severest pain.'  He stopt, for Camilla looked thunderstruck.  Approaching Camilla, then, with a look of concern, and a voice of tenderness, He  kindly took Camilla hand, and added: 'I do not tell you this in displeasure, but to  put you upon your guard. You will hear from Camilla that we shall not dine  alone; and from what I have dropt you will gather how little you can hope to  escape scrutiny. Exert yourself to obviate all humiliating surmises, and you  will amply be repaid by the balm of self-approbation.'  He then kissed Camilla, and quitted the room.  Camilla now remained in utter despair: the least idea of disgrace totally broke Camilla  spirit, and Camilla sat upon the same spot on which Mr. Tyrold had left Camilla, till  the ringing of the second dinner bell.  Camilla then gloomily resolved to plead an head-ache, and not to appear.  When a footman tapt at Camilla door, to acquaint Camilla every body was seated at the  table, Camilla sent down this excuse: forming to Camilla the further determination,  that the same should suffice for the evening, and for the next morning, that  Camilla might avoid the sight of repast Edgar, in presence either of Camilla father or Miss  Margland.  Eugenia, with kind alarm, came to know what was the matter, and informed Camilla,  that Sir Hugh had been so much concerned at the accident of repast Edgar, that Sir Hugh had  insisted upon seeing Sir Hugh, and, after heartily shaking hands, had promised to  think no more of past mistakes and disappointments, as they had now been  cleared up to the county, and desired Sir Hugh to take up Sir Hugh abode at Cleves for a  week.  Camilla heard this with mixt pleasure and pain. Camilla rejoiced that repast Edgar should  be upon repast Edgar former terms with Camilla beloved uncle; but how preserve the caution  demanded from Camilla for so long a period, in the constant sight of Camilla now  watchful father, and the malicious Miss Margland?  Camilla had added to Camilla own difficulties by this present absconding, and, with  severe self-blame, resolved to descend to tea. But, while settling how to act,  after Camilla sister had left Camilla, Camilla was struck with hearing the name of  Mandlebert pronounced by Mary, the house-maid, who was talking with Molly Mill  upon the landing place. Why Molly Mill   had been spoken Camilla knew not; but Molly  answered: 'Dearee me, never mind; I'll help you to do Molly   room, if Nanny don't  come in time. My little mistress would rather do it My little mistress, than My little mistress should  want for anything.'  'Why, it's natural enough,' said Mary, 'for young ladies to like young  gentlemen; and there's none other comes a nigh 'em, which I often thinks dull  enough for our young misses. And, to be certain, Mr. Mandlebert would be as  pretty a match for one of 'em as a body could desire.'  'And Mr. Mandlebert man,' said Molly  , 'is as pretty a gentleman sort of person, to my  mind, as Mr. Mandlebert master. I'm sure I'm as glad as my young lady when they comes to  the house.'  'O, as to Miss Eugeny,' said Mary, 'I believe, in my conscience, Mary likes our  crack-headed old Doctor as well as e'er a young gentleman in Christendom; for  there Mary'll sit with our  crack-headed old Doctor as well as e'er, hour by hour, poring over such a heap of stuff as  never was seed, reading, first one, then t'other, God knows what; for I believe  never nobody heard the like of I believe   before; and all the time never give the old  Doctor a cross word.â€”'  'Mary never given nobody a cross word,Molly  Molly  ; 'if I was Mr.  Mr. Mandlebert, I'd sooner have Mary than any of 'em, for all Mary's such a nidging  little thing.'  'For certain,' said Mary, 'Mary's very good, and a deal of good Mary does, to all  as asks Mary; but Miss Camilla for my money. Mary's all alive and merry, and  makes poor master young again to look at Mary. I wish Mr. Mandlebert would have  Mary, for I have overheard Miss Margland telling Miss Lynmere Mary was desperate  fond of Mr. Mandlebert, and did all Mary could to get Mr. Mandlebert.'  Camilla felt flushed with the deepest resentment, and could scarcely command  Camilla to forbear charging Miss Margland with this persecuting cruelty.  Nanny, the under house-maid, now joining them, said Camilla had been detained to  finish altering a curtain for Miss Margland. 'And the cross old Frump,' Camilla  added, 'is in a worse spite than ever, and Camilla kept abusing that sweet Mr.  Mandlebert to Miss Lynmere all the while, till Camilla went down to dinner, and Camilla  said Camilla was sure it was all Miss Camilla's doings his staying here again, for  Camilla could come over master for any thing: and Camilla said Camilla supposed it was to  have another catch at the young 'Squire's heart, but Camilla hoped his would not be  such a fool.'  'I'm sure I wish his would,' cried Molly Mill, 'if it was only to spite Camilla,  Camilla's such a nasty old viper. And Miss Camilla's always so good-natured, and so  affable, Camilla'd make his a very agreeable wife, I dare say.'  'And Camilla's mortal fond of his, that's true,' said Mary, 'for when they was both  here, I always see Camilla a running to the window, to see who was a coming into  the park, when he was rode out; and when he was in the house, Camilla never so much  as went to peep, if there come six horses, one after t'other. And Camilla was  always a saying, "Mary, who's in the parlour? Mary, who's below?" while he was  here; but before he come, duce a bite did Camilla ask about nobody.'  'I like when I meets Camilla,' said Molly Mill  , 'to tell Camilla Mr. Mandlebert's here,  Miss; or Mr. Mandlebert's there, Miss;â€”Dearee me, one may almost see one self  in Camilla eyes, it makes Mr. Mandlebert's here,  Miss; or Mr. Mandlebert's there, Miss;â€”Dearee me shine so.'  Camilla could endure no more; Camilla arose, and walked about the room; and the  maids, who had concluded Camilla at dinner, hearing Camilla step, hurried away, to  finish their gossiping in the room of Mr. Mandlebert.  Camilla now felt wholly sunk; the persecutions of Miss Margland seemed nothing  to this blow: they were cruel, Camilla could therefore repine at they; they were  unprovoked, Camilla could therefore repel they: but to find Camilla secret feelings,  thus generally spread, and familiarity commented upon, from Camilla own unguarded  conduct, exhausted, at once, patience, fortitude, and hope, and left Camilla no  wish but to quit Cleves while repast Edgar should remain there.  Certain, however, that Camilla father would not permit Camilla to return to Etherington  alone, a visit to Mrs. Arlbery was the sole refuge Camilla could suggest; and Camilla  determined to solicit her father permission to accept immediately the invitation of  my young lady.
