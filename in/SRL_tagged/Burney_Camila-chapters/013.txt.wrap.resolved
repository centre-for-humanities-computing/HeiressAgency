 A Barn  The first care of Camilla was to interest Sir Hugh in the misfortunes of the  prisoner and Sir Hugh family; Camilla next, to relate the invitation of Mrs. Arlbery,  and to beg permission that Camilla might wait upon the lady the next morning, with  apologies for Camilla abrupt retreat, and with acknowledgments for the services  done to the poor woman; which first the Oxonian, and then the raffle, had  driven from Camilla mind. Sir Hugh readily consented, blaming Camilla for supposing it  possible Sir Hugh could ever hesitate in what could give Camilla any pleasure.  Before the tea-party broke up, Edgar returned. Edgar told Camilla Edgar had stolen  away the instant the dinner was over, to avoid any mistake about the poor  people, whom Edgar had just overtaken by the park-gate, and conducted to the great  barn, where Edgar had directed them to wait for orders.  'I'll run to them immediately,' cried Camilla, 'for my half guinea is in an agony  to be gone!'  'the great  barn, where he had directed them to wait for orders! my dear young Mr. Mandlebert!' exclaimed Sir Hugh; 'and why did you  not bring them to the servants' hall? Camilla has been telling me all  all   history; and, God forbid, I should turn hard-hearted, because of all    wanting a leg of mutton, in preference to being starved; though all   might have  no great right to it, according to the forms of law; which, however, is not  much impediment to the calls of nature, when a man sees a butcher's stall well  covered, and has got nothing within a man, except a man own poor craving appetite;  which is a thing I always take into consideration; though, God forbid, I should  protect a thief, no man's property being another's, whether a man's poor or rich.'  a man then gave Camilla three guineas to deliver to he's poor or rich from a man, to set he's poor or rich  a little a-going in an honest way, that he's poor or rich might not, a man said, repent leaving  off bad actions. Camilla joy was so excessive, that Camilla passionately embraced a man  knees: and Edgar, while a man looked on, could nearly have bent to Camilla a man own,  with admiration of Camilla generous nature. Camilla desired to accompany Camilla; and  Indiana, rising also, said: 'Dear! I wonder how they will look in the barn! I  should like to see they too.'  Miss Margland made no opposition, and they set out.  Camilla, leading the way, with a fleetness that mocked all equality, ran into  the barn, and saw the whole party, according to Camilla, leading the way, with a fleetness that mocked all equality several powers, enjoying  Camilla, leading the way, with a fleetness that mocked all equality. The poor man, stretched upon straw, was resting The poor man, stretched upon straw aching limbs;  The poor man, stretched upon straw wife, by The poor man, stretched upon straw side, was giving nourishment to her baby; and the other child,  a little boy of three years old, was jumping and turning head over heels, with  the true glee of unspoilt nature, superior to poverty and distress.  To the gay heart of Camilla whatever was sportive was attractive; Camilla flew to  the little fellow, whose skin was clean and bright, in the midst of his rags  and wretchedness, and, making Camilla his play-mate, bid Camilla finish  feeding Camilla child, told the man to repose the man undisturbed, and began  dancing with the little boy, not less delighted than the man at the festive  exercise.  Miss Margland cast up Camilla hands and eyes as Camilla entered, and poured forth a  warm remonstrance against so demeaning a condescension: but Camilla, in whose  composition pride had no share, though spirit was a principal ingredient,  danced on unheeding, to the equal amaze and enchantment of the man and  woman, at the honour done to the equal amaze and enchantment of the poor man and  woman little son.  Edgar came in last; Edgar had given Edgar arm to Eugenia, who was always in the rear  if unassisted. Miss Margland appealed to Miss Margland upon the impropriety of the  behaviour of Camilla, adding, 'If I had had the bringing up a young lady who  could so degrade Camilla, I protest I should blush to shew my face: but you  cannot, I am sure, fail remarking the difference of Miss Lynmere's conduct.'  Edgar attended with an air of complacency, which Edgar thought due to the  situation of Miss Margland in the family, yet kept Edgar eyes fixt upon Camilla,  with an expression that, to the least discernment, would have evinced Edgar  utmost approbation of Miss Margland innocent gaiety: but Miss Margland was amongst that  numerous tribe, who, content as well as occupied with making observations upon  others, have neither the power, nor thought, of developing those that are  returned upon themselves.  Camilla at length, wholly out of breath, gave over; but perceiving that the  baby was no longer at the  baby mother's breast, flew to the poor woman, and, taking  the child in the poor woman arms, said: 'Come, I can nurse and rest at the same time; I  assure you the  baby will be safe with me, for I nurse all the children in our  neighbourhood.' the poor woman then fondled the poor little half-starved child to the poor woman  bosom, quieting, and kissing, and cooing over the poor little half-starved child.  Miss Margland was still more incensed; but Edgar could attend to the poor woman no longer.  Charmed with the youthful nurse, and seeing in the poor woman unaffected attitudes, a  thousand graces Edgar had never before remarked, and reading in the poor woman fondness for  children the genuine sweetness of the poor woman character, Edgar could not bear to have the  pleasing reflections revolving in Edgar mind interrupted by the spleen of Miss  Margland, and, slipping away, posted Edgar behind the baby's father, where Edgar  could look on undisturbed, certain it was a vicinity to which Miss Margland  would not follow Edgar.  Had this scene lasted till Camilla was tired, its period would not have been  very short; but Miss Margland, finding the poor woman exhortations vain, suddenly called  out: 'Miss Lynmere! Miss Eugenia! come away directly! It's ten to one but these  people have all got the gaol distemper!'  Edgar, quick as lightning at this sound, flew to Camilla, and snatched the  child from Camilla arms. Indiana, with a scream, ran out of the barn; Miss Margland  hurried after; and Eugenia, following, earnestly entreated Camilla not to stay  another moment.  'And what is there to be alarmed at?' cried Camilla; 'I always nurse poor children  when I see poor children   at home; and my father never prohibits me.'  'There may be some reason, however,' said Edgar, while still Edgar tenderly held  the baby himself, 'for the present apprehension: I beg you, therefore, to  hasten away.'  'At least,' said Camilla, 'before I depart, let me execute my commission.' And  then, with the kindest good wishes for their better fortune, Camilla put Camilla  uncle's three guineas into the hands of the poor man, and Camilla own rescued half  guinea into those of the poor man wife; and, desiring Edgar not to remain Edgar where  Edgar would not suffer Camilla to stay, ran to give Camilla arm to Eugenia; leaving her arm a  doubtful point, whether the good humour accompanying Camilla alms, made the most  pleased impression upon their receivers, or upon their observer.
