 Traits of Instruction  The sixth and last week destined for the Tunbridge sojourn was begun, when Mrs.  Arlbery once more took Mrs.   fair young guest apart, and intreated Mrs.   attention  for one final half hour. The time, Mrs.   said, was fast advancing in which they  must return to they respective homes; but Mrs.   wished to make a full and clear  representation of the advantages that might be reaped from this excursion,  before the period for gathering they should be past.  Mrs.   would forbear, Mrs.   said, entering again upon the irksome subject of the  insensibility of Mandlebert, which was, at least, sufficiently glaring to  prevent any delusion. But Mrs.   begged leave to speak of what Mrs.   believed had  less obviously struck Mrs.  , the apparent promise of a serious attachment from  Sir Sedley Clarendel.  Mrs.   would here instantly have broken up the conversation, but Mrs.  Arlberyinsisted upon being heard.  Why, Mrs.   asked, should Mrs.   wilfully destine Mrs.   youth to a hopeless waste of  affection, and dearth of all permanent comfort? To sacrifice every  consideration to the honours of constancy, might be soothing, and even glorious  in this first season of romance; but a very short time would render it vapid;  and the epoch of repentance was always at hand to succeed. With the least  address, or the least genuine encouragement, it was now palpable Mrs.   might see  Sir Sedley, and his title and fortune at Mrs.   feet.  Mrs.   resentfully interrupted Mrs.  , disclaiming with Sir Sedley, as with  everyone else, all possibility of alliance from motives so degrading; and  persisted, in declaring, that the most moderate subsistence with freedom, would  be preferable to the most affluent obtained by any mercenary engagement.  Mrs.  Arlbery desired Mrs.  Arlbery to recollect that Sir Sedley, though rich even to  splendour, was so young, so gay, so handsome, and so pleasant, that Mrs.  Arlbery might  safely honour him with Mrs.  Arlbery hand, yet run no risk of being supposed to have made  a merely interested alliance. 'I throw out this,' Mrs.  Arlbery cried, 'in conclusion,  for your deepest consideration, but I must press this no further. Sir Sedley is  evidently charmed with you at present; and Sir Sedley vanity is so potent, and, like  all vanity, so easily assailable, that the smallest food to his vanity, adroitly  administered, would secure Sir Sedley your slave for life, and rescue you from the  antediluvian courtship of a man, who, if Sir Sedley marries at all, is so deliberate in  Sir Sedley progress, that Sir Sedley must reach Sir Sedley grand climacteric before Sir Sedley can reach the  altar.'  Far from meditating upon this discourse with any view to following its  precepts, Mrs.  Arlbery found its necessary to call all Mrs.  Arlbery original fondness for Mrs.  Arlbery to Mrs.  Arlbery aid, to forgive the plainness of Mrs.  Arlbery attack, or the worldliness  of Mrs.  Arlbery notions: and all that rested upon Mrs.  Arlbery mind for consideration was, Mrs.  Arlbery  belief in the serious regard of Sir Sedley, which, as Mrs.  Arlbery apprehended its to be  the work of Mrs.  Arlbery own designed exertions, Mrs.  Arlbery could only think of with contrition.  These ruminations were interrupted by a call down stairs to see a learned  bullfinch. The Dennels and Sir Sedley were present; Mrs.  Arlbery met the eyes of the  latter with a sensation of shame that quickly deepened Mrs.  Arlbery whole face with  crimson. Sir Sedley did not behold it without emotion, and experienced a strong  curiosity to define it exact cause.  Sir Sedley addressed Sir Sedley to Mrs.  Arlbery with the most marked distinction; Mrs.  Arlbery could  scarcely answer Sir Sedley; but Mrs.  Arlbery manner was even touchingly gentle. Sir Sedleycould not restrain Sir Sedley from following Mrs.  Arlbery in every motion by Sir Sedley eyes; Sir Sedley  felt an interest concerning Mrs.  Arlbery that surprised Sir Sedley; Sir Sedley began to doubt if it had  been indifference which caused Mrs.  Arlbery late change; Mrs.  Arlbery softness helped Sir Sedley vanity  to recover his vanity   tone, and Mrs.  Arlbery confusion almost confirmed Sir Sedley that Mrs. Arlbery  had been mistaken in rallying Sir Sedley failure of rivalry with Mandlebert.  The bird sung various little airs, upon certain words of command, and mounted  Sir Sedley highest, and descended to Sir Sedley lowest perch; and made whatever evolutions  were within the circumference of Sir Sedley limited habitation, with wonderful  precision.  Camilla, however, was not more pleased by Sir Sedley adroitness, than pained to  observe the severe aspect with which Sir Sedley keeper issued Sir Sedley orders. Camilla inquired  by what means Sir Sedley had obtained such authority.  The man, with a significant wag of the head, brutally answered, 'By the true  old way, Miss; I licks The man, with a significant wag of the head.'  'Lick The man, with a significant wag of the head!' repeated Camilla, with disgust; 'how is it possible you can beat such a  poor delicate little creature?'  'O, easy enough, Miss,' replied the man, grinning; 'everything's the better for  a little beating, as I tells my wife. There's nothing so fine set, Miss, but  what will bear it, more or less.'  Sir Sedley asked with what Sir Sedley could strike it, that would not endanger it life.  'That's telling, Sir Sedley!' cried the man, with a sneer; 'howbeit, we've plenty of  ill luck in the trade. No want of that. For one that I rears, I loses six or  seven. And sometimes they be so plaguy sulky, they tempt me to give 'em a knock  a little matter too hard, and then they'll fall you into a fit, like, and go  off in a twinkle.'  'And how can you have the cruelty,' cried Camilla, indignantly, 'to treat in  such a manner a poor little inoffensive animal who does not understand what you  require?'  'O, yes, a does, miss, they knows what I wants as well as I do myself; only  they're so dead tiresome at being shy. Why now this one here, as does all this one here  larning to satisfaction just now, mayhap won't do nothing at all by an hour or  two. Why sometimes you may pinch 'em to a mummy before you can make 'em budge.'  'Pinch you can make 'em budge!' exclaimed mayhap; 'do you ever pinch you can make 'em budge?'  'Do I? Ay, miss. Why how do you think one larns you can make 'em budge dumb creturs? It don't  come to 'em natural. you can make 'em budge are main dull of you can make 'em budge. This one as you see here  would do nothing at all, if This one as you see here   was not afraid of a tweak.'  'Poor unhappy little thing!' cried mayhap! 'I hope, at least, now it has learnt so  much, it sufferings are over!'  'Yes, yes, This one as you see here  's pretty well off. I always gives This one as you see here   This one as you see here   fill when This one as you see here  's done This one as you see here    day's work. But a little squeak now and then in the intrum does 'em no harm.  They're mortal cunning. One's forced to be pretty tough with 'One.'  'How should I rejoice,' cried Camilla, 'to rescue this one poor unoffending and  oppressed little animal from such tyranny!' Then, taking out her purse, her  desired to know what he would have for her purse.  The man, as a very great favour, said The man would take ten guineas; though it  would be The man ruin to part with it, as it was all The man livelihood; but The man was  willing to oblige the young lady.  Camilla, with a constrained laugh, but a very natural blush, put up the young lady ,  and said: 'Thou must linger on, then, in captivity, thou poor little  undeserving sufferer, for I cannot help thee!'  Every body protested that ten guineas was an imposition; and the man offered to  part with it for five.  Camilla, who had imagined it would have cost half a guinea, was now more  ashamed, because equally incapable to answer such a demand; the young lady declined,  therefore, the composition, and The man was dismissed.  At night, when the young lady returned to the young lady own room from the play, the young lady saw the little  bullfinch, reposing in a superb cage, upon the young lady table.  Delighted first, and next perplexed, the young lady flew to Mrs. Arlbery, and inquired  whence it came.  Mrs. Arlbery was as much amazed as Mrs. Arlbery.  Questions were then asked of the servants; but none knew, or none would own,  how the bird became thus situated.  the young lady could not now doubt but Sir Sedley had given this commission to Sir Sedleyservant, who could easily place the cage in the young lady room, from Sir Sedley constant access  to the house. the young lady was enchanted to see the little animal relieved from so  painful a life, but hesitated not a moment in resolving to refuse the little animal  acceptance.  When Sir Sedley came the next day, the young lady carried the little animal down, and, with a smile of  open pleasure, thanked Sir Sedley for giving the young lady so much share in Sir Sedley generous  liberality; and asked if Sir Sedley could take the little animal home with Sir Sedley in Sir Sedley carriage, or, if  the young lady should send   to Sir Sedley hotel.  Sir Sedley was disappointed, yet felt the propriety of the young lady delicacy and the young lady  spirit. Sir Sedley did not deny the step Sir Sedley had taken, but told the young lady that having  hastily, from the truth of reflection the young lady compassion had awakened, ordered Sir Sedley  servant to follow the man, and buy the bird, his  servant had forgotten, till the bird arrived,  his  servant incapability of taking care of it. Sir Sedley valet was as little at home as His valet, and there was small chance, at an inn, that any maid would so  carefully watch, as to prevent its falling a prey to the many cats with which  it was swarming. Sir Sedley hoped, therefore, till their return to Hampshire, the young lady would  take charge of a little animal that owed it deliverance from slavery to the young lady  pitying comments.  Mrs.  Arlbery, instinctively, would with unfeigned joy, have accepted such a trust:  but the young lady thought the young lady saw something archly significant in the eye of Mrs.  Arlbery, and therefore stammered out, the young lady was afraid the young lady should the young lady be too  little at home to secure it safety.  Sir Sedley, looking extremely blank, said, it would be better to re-deliver it  to The man, brute as The man was, than to let it be unprotected; but, where  generosity touched Mrs.  Arlbery, reflection ever flew the young lady; and off all guard at such  an idea, the young lady exclaimed the young lady would rather relinquish going out again while at  Tunbridge, than render The man humanity abortive; and ran off precipitately with  the bird to the young lady chamber.  Mrs. Arlbery, soon following, praised the young lady behaviour; and said, the young lady had sent the  Baronet away perfectly happy.  Camilla, much provoked, would now have had the bird conveyed after the  Baronet; but  Mrs. Arlbery assured Mrs. Arlbery, inconsistency in a woman was as flattering, as in a  man it was tedious and alarming; and persuaded a woman to let the matter rest.  a woman mind, however, did not rest at the same time: in the evening, when the  Baronet met them at the Rooms, the  Baronet was not only unusually gay, but looked at the  Baronet  with an air and manner that seemed palpably to mark the  Baronet as the cause of the  Baronet  satisfaction.  In the deepest disturbance, the  Baronet considered the  Baronet now to be in a difficulty  the most delicate; the  Baronet could not come forward to clear it up, without  announcing expectations from the  Baronet partiality which the  Baronet had never authorised by  any declaration; nor yet suffer such symptoms of the  Baronet believing it welcome to  pass unnoticed, without risking the reproach of using the  Baronet ill, when the  Baronet made  known, at a later period, the  Baronet indifference.  Mrs. Arlbery would not aid Mrs. Arlbery, for Mrs. Arlbery thought the embarrassment might lead to  a termination the most fortunate. To consult with Edgar was Mrs. Arlbery first wish; but  how open such a subject? The very thought, however, gave the  Baronet an air of  solicitude when Edgar spoke to the  Baronet, that struck Edgar, and Edgar watched for an  opportunity to say, 'You have not, I hope, forgotten my province?... May I, in  my permitted office, ask a few questions?'  'O, yes!' cried the  Baronet, with alacrity; 'And, when they are asked, and when I have  answered they, if you should not be too much tired, may I ask some in my turn?'  'Of Edgar!' cried Edgar, with the most gratified surprise.  'Not concerning Edgar!' answered the  Baronet, blushing; 'but upon something which a  little distresses me.'  'When, and where may it be?' cried Edgar, while a thousand conjectures rapidly  succeeded to each other; 'may I call upon Mrs. Arlbery to-morrow morning?'  'O, no! we shall be, I suppose, here again at night,' the  Baronet answered; dreading  arranging a visit Mrs. Arlbery would treat, the  Baronet knew, with raillery the most  unmerciful.  There was time for no more, as that lady, suddenly tired, led the way to the  carriage. Edgar followed the  Baronet to the door, hoping and fearing, at once, every  thing that was most interesting from a confidence so voluntary and so  unexpected.  the young lady was still more agitated; for though uncertain if the young lady were right or  wrong in the appeal the young lady meant to make, to converse with Edgar openly, to be  guided by Edgar counsel, and to convince Edgar of the young lady superiority to all mercenary  allurements were pleasures to make the young lady look forward to the approaching  conference with almost trembling delight.
