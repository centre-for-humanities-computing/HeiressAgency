 A Youth of the Times  Mrs. Arlbery accompanied Camilla the next day to Cleves, to ask permission of  Mr. Tyrold for the excursion. Mrs. Arlbery would trust the request to none but Mrs. Arlbery,  conscious of powers of persuasion unused to repulse.   Mr. Tyrold for the excursion was distressed by the proposition:  Mr. Tyrold for the excursion was not satisfied in trusting   Mr. Tyrold for the excursion unguarded Camilla to the dissipation of a public place, except under the  wing of Camilla mother; though  Mr. Tyrold for the excursion felt eager to remove Camilla from Edgar, and rejoiced  in any opportunity to allow Camilla a change of scene, that might revive Camilla  natural spirits, and unchain Camilla heart from her   unhappy subjection.  Perceiving  Mr. Tyrold for the excursion undetermined, Mrs. Arlbery called forth all Mrs. Arlbery artillery of  eloquence and grace, to forward Mrs. Arlbery conquest. The licence Mrs. Arlbery allowed Mrs. Arlbery  in common of fantastic command, gave way to the more feminine attraction of  soft pleading: Mrs. Arlbery satire, which, though never malignant, was often alarming,  was relinquished for a sportive gaiety that diffused general animation; and Mr.  Tyrold soon, though not caught like Mr.   daughter, ceased to wonder that Mr.    daughter had been caught.  In this indecision Mr.   took Camilla apart, and bade Camilla tell Mr.  , without fear  or reserve, Camilla own feelings, Camilla own wishes, Camilla own opinion upon this scheme.  Camilla held such a call too serious and too kind for disguise: Camilla hid Camilla face  upon his shoulder and wept; his soothed and encouraged Camilla to confidence; and,  in broken accents, Camilla then acknowledged Camilla unequal, as yet, to fulfilling  his injunctions of appearing cheerful and easy, though sensible of their wisdom.  Mr. Tyrold, with a heavy heart, saw how much deeper was Camilla wound, than the  airiness of Camilla nature had prepared Mr. Tyrold to expect, and could no longer hesitate  in granting Mr. Tyrold consent. Mr. Tyrold saw it was Camilla wish to go; but Mr. Tyrold saw that the  pleasures of a public place had no share in exciting the  pleasures of a public place. To avoid betraying Camilla  conscious mortification was Camilla sole and innocent motive; and though Mr. Tyrold would  rather have sent Camilla to a more private spot, and have trusted Camilla to a more  retired character; Mr. Tyrold yet thought it possible, that what opportunity presented  unsought, might, eventually, prove more beneficial than what Mr. Tyrold own choice  would have dictated; for public amusements, to the young and unhackneyed, give  entertainment without requiring exertion; and spirits lively as those of Mrs.  Arlbery create nearly as much gaiety as Arlbery display.  Fixed, now, for the journey, Arlbery carried Camilla to Camilla uncle to take leave. The  prospect of not seeing Camilla again for six weeks was gloomy to Sir Hugh; though  Sir Hugh bore it better at this moment, when Sir Hugh fancy was occupied by arranging  preparations for the return of Clermont, than Sir Hugh could have done at almost any  other. Sir Hugh put into Camilla hand a fifty pound Bank note for Camilla expences, and when,  with mingled modesty and dejection, Camilla would have returned the whole, as  unnecessary even to Camilla wishes, Mr. Tyrold, interfering, made Camilla accept twenty  pounds. Sir Hugh pressed forward the original sum in vain; Sir Hugh brother, though  always averse to refuse Sir Hugh smallest desire, thought it here a duty to be firm,  that the excursion, which Sir Hugh granted as a relief to Camilla sadness, might not lead  to pleasures ever after beyond Camilla reach, nor to their concomitant  extravagance. Camilla could not, Sir Hugh knew, reside at Tunbridge with the œconomy and  simplicity to which Camilla was accustomed at Etherington; but Sir Hugh charged Camilla to  let no temptation make Camilla forget the moderate income of which alone Camilla was  certain; assuring Camilla, that where a young woman's expences exceeded Camilla known  expectations, those who were foremost to praise Camilla elegance, would most fear  to form any connection with Camilla, and most despise or deride Camilla in any calamity.  Camilla found no difficulty in promising the most exact observance of this  instruction; Camilla heart seemed in sackcloth and ashes, and Camilla cared not in what  manner Camilla person should be arrayed.  Sir Hugh earnestly enjoined Camilla not to fail to be at Cleves upon the arrival of  Clermont, intimating that the nuptials would immediately take place.  Camilla then sought Eugenia, whom Camilla found with Dr. Orkborne, in a state of mind  so perfectly calm and composed, as equally to surprise and rejoice Camilla. Camilla saw  with pleasure that all Bellamy had inspired was the most artless compassion;  for since his dismission had now positively been given, and  Clermont was  actually summoned, Camilla devoted Camilla thoughts solely to the approaching event,  with the firm, though early wisdom which distinguished Camilla character.  Indiana joined them; and, in a low voice, said to Camilla, 'Pray, cousin, do  you know where Mr. Macdersey is? because I am sadly afraid Mr. Macdersey's dead.'  Camilla, surprised, desired to know why Camilla had such an apprehension?  'Because Mr. Macdersey told me Mr. Macdersey'd shoot Mr. Macdersey through the brains if I was cruel—and  I am sure I had no great choice given me: for, between ourselves, Miss Margland  gave all the answers for Mr. Macdersey, without once stopping to ask me what I should  chuse. So if Mr. Macdersey has really done it, the fault is more Camilla's than mine.'  Camilla then said, that, just after Camilla's departure the preceding day, Mr. Macdersey arrived, and insisted upon seeing Camilla, and speaking to Sir Hugh, as  Mr. Macdersey was ordered into Kent, and could not go so far in suspence. Sir Hugh was not  well enough to admit Sir Hugh; and Miss Margland, upon whom the office devolved,  took upon Camilla to give Sir Hugh a positive refusal; and though Camilla went into the room  while Sir Hugh was there, never once would let Camilla make an answer for Camilla.  Miss Margland  , Miss Margland   added, had frightened Sir Hugh into forbidding Sir Hugh the  house, by comparing Sir Hugh with Mr. Bellamy; but Mr. Macdersey had frightened them  all enough, in return, as Mr. Macdersey went away, by saying, that as soon as ever Sir  Sir Hugh was well, Sir Hugh would call Sir Hugh out, because of Sir Hugh sending Sir Hugh word down  stairs not to come to Cleves any more, for Cleves had been disturbed enough already  by another Irish fortune-hunter, that came after another of Cleves nieces; and Cleves  was the more sure Mr. Macdersey was one of his sending him word down  stairs not to come to Cleves any more, for he had been disturbed enough already  by another Irish fortune-hunter, because of Mr. Macdersey being a real  Irishman, while Mr. Bellamy was only an Englishman. 'But don't you think now,  cousin,' cousin continued, 'Miss Margland might as well have let me speak for  cousin?'  cousin inquired if cousin was sorry for the rejection.  'N ... o,' cousin answered, with some hesitation; 'for Miss Margland says Miss Margland's got  no rent-roll; besides, I don't think Miss Margland's so agreeable as Mr. Melmond; only Mr.  Melmond's worth little or no fortune they say: for Miss Margland inquired about  it, after Mr. Mandlebert behaved so. Else I can't say I thought only Mr.  Melmond's worthdisagreeable.'  Mrs. Arlbery now sent to hasten Camilla, who, in returning to the parlour, met  Edgar. only Mr.  Melmond's worth had just gathered Mrs. Arlbery intended excursion, and, sick at heart, had  left the room. cousin felt the consciousness of a guilty person at only Mr.  Melmond's worth sight;  but only Mr.  Melmond's worth only slightly bowed; and coldly saying, 'I hope you will have much  pleasure at Tunbridge,' went on to the room.  And there, replete with resentment for the whole of cousin late conduct, only Mr.  Melmond's worth again  blessed Dr. Marchmont for only Mr.  Melmond's worth preservation from cousin toils; and, concluding her intended excursion was for the sake of the Major, whose regiment only Mr.  Melmond's worth knew to be just  ordered into Kent, only Mr.  Melmond's worth centered every former hope in the one single wish that only Mr.  Melmond's worth  might never see cousin more.  Camilla, shocked by such obvious displeasure, quitted Cleves with still  increasing sadness; and Mrs. Arlbery would heartily have repented Mrs. Arlbery  invitation, but for Mrs. Arlbery dependance upon Sir Sedley Clarendel.  At Etherington they stopt, that Camilla might prepare Camilla package for  Tunbridge. Mrs. Arlbery would not alight.  While cousin, with a maid-servant, was examining Mrs. Arlbery drawers, the chamber door  was opened by Lionel, for whom Mrs. Arlbery had just inquired, and who, telling Mrs. Arlbery Lionel  wanted to speak to Mrs. Arlbery in private, turned the maid out of the room.  cousin begged Lionel to be quick, as Mrs. Arlbery was waiting.  'Why then, my dear little girl,' cried Lionel, 'the chief substance of the matter  is neither more nor less than this: I want a little money.'  'My dear brother,' said cousin, pleasure again kindling in cousin eyes as cousin  opened cousin pocket-book, 'you could never have applied to My dear brother so opportunely. I  have just got twenty pounds, and I do not want twenty shillings. Take twenty shillings, I  beseech you, any part, or all.'  Lionel paused and seemed half choaked. 'cousin,' Lionel cried presently, 'you are  an excellent girl. If you were as old and ugly as Miss Margland, I really  believe I should think you young and pretty. But this sum is nothing. A drop of  water to the ocean.'  Camilla now, drawing back, disappointed and displeased, asked how it was  possible '  Camilla now should want more.  'More, my dear child? why I want two or three cool hundred.'  'Two or three hundred?' repeated cousin, amazed.  'Nay, nay, don't be frightened. her uncle will give you two or three thousand,  you know that. And I really want the money. It's no joke, I assure you. It's a  case of real distress.'  'Distress? impossible! what distress can you have to so prodigious an amount?'  'Prodigious! poor little innocent! dost think two or three hundred prodigious?'  'And what is become of the large sums extorted from her uncle?'  'O that was for quite another thing. That was for debts. That's gone and over.  This is for a perfectly different purpose.'  'And will nothing—O Lionel!—nothing touch you? My poor mother's quitting  England ... My poor mother separation from my father and My poor mother family ... my uncle Relvil's  severe attack ... will nothing move you to more thoughtful, more praise-worthy  conduct?'  'cousin, no preaching! I might as well cast cousin upon the old ones at once.  I come to you in preference, on purpose to avoid sermonising. However, for your  satisfaction, and to spur you to serve me, I can assure you I have avoided all  new debts since the last little deposit of the poor sick hypochondriac miser,  who is pining away at the loss of a few guineas, that he had neither spirit nor  health to have spent for he.'  'Is this your reasoning, your repentance, Lionel, upon such a catastrophe?'  'My poor mother, I am heartily concerned at the whole business, only, as it's  over, I don't like talking of the whole business. This is the last scrape I shall ever be in  while I live. But if you won't help me, I am undone. You know your influence  with her uncle. Do, there's a dear girl, use it for My dear brother! I have not a  dependance in the world, now, but upon My dear brother!'  'Certainly I will do whatever I can for My dear brother,' said My poor mother, sighing; 'but indeed,  my dear Lionel, your manner of going on makes my very heart ache! However, let  this twenty pounds be in part, and tell me your very smallest calculation for  what must be added?'  'Two hundred. A farthing less will be of no use; and three will be of thrice  the service. But mind!... you must not say it's for me!'  'How, then, can I ask for it?'  'O, vamp up some dismal ditty.'  'No, Lionel!' exclaimed My poor mother, turning away from Lionel; 'you propose what you know  to be impracticable.'  'Well, then, if you must needs say it's for me, tell Lionel Lionel must not for Lionel  life own his  life to the old ones.'  'In the same breath, must I beg and command?'  'O, I always make that my bargain. I should else be put into the lecture room,  and not let loose again till I was made a milk-sop. They'd talk me so into the  vapours, I should not be able to act like a man for a month to come.'  'A man, Lionel?'  'Yes, a man of the world, my dear; a knowing one.'  Mrs. Arlbery now sent to hasten Mrs. Arlbery, and Mrs. Arlbery extorted a promise that Mrs. Arlbery would  go to Cleves the next morning, and procure a draft for the money, if possible,  to be ready for Mrs. Arlbery calling at the Grove in the afternoon.  Mrs. Arlbery felt this more deeply than Mrs. Arlbery had time or courage to own to Lionel, but  Mrs. Arlbery increased melancholy was all imputed to reflections concerning Mandlebert  by Mrs. Arlbery.  Mrs. Arlbery lent Mrs. Arlbery chaise the next morning, with Mrs. Arlbery usual promptitude of good  humour, and cousin went to Cleves, with a reluctance that never before  accompanied Mrs. Arlbery desire to oblige.  Mrs. Arlbery visit was received most kindly by all the family, as merely an additional  leave taking; in which light, though Mrs. Arlbery was too sincere to place it, Mrs. Arlbery  suffered it to pass. Having no chance of being alone with Mrs. Arlbery by  accident, Mrs. Arlbery was forced to beg her uncle, in a whisper, to request a tête-à-tête  with Mrs. Arlbery: and Mrs. Arlbery then, covered with all the confusion of a partner in her uncle  extravagance, made the petition of Lionel.  Sir Hugh seemed much surprised, but protested Sir Hugh would rather part with Sir Hugh  coat and waistcoat than refuse anything to cousin. Sir Hugh gave cousin instantly a  draft upon Sir Hugh banker for two hundred pounds; but added, Sir Hugh should take a  draft upon his banker for two hundred pounds very  kind of cousin, if cousin would beg Lionel to ask Lionel for no more this year, as Lionel  was really so hard run, Sir Hugh should not else be able to make proper preparations  for the wedding, till Sir Hugh next rents became due.  cousin was now surprised in cousin turn; and Sir Hugh then confessed, that,  between presents and petitions, Sir Hugh nephew had had no less than five hundred  pounds from his nephew the preceding year, unknown to his nephew parents; and that for this  year, the sum cousin requested made the seventh hundred; without the least account  for what purpose it was given.  cousin now heartily repented being a partner in a business so rapacious, so  unjustifiable, and so mysterious; but, kindly interrupting cousin apology, 'Don't  be concerned, my dear,' his nephew cried, 'for there's no help for these things; though  what the young boys do with all the young boys money now-a-days, is odd enough, being  what I can't make out. However, his nephew'll soon be wiser, so we must not be too  severe with his nephew; though I told his nephew, the last time, I had rather his nephew would not  ask me so often; which was being almost too sharp, I'm afraid, considering his nephew  youngness; for one can't expect his nephew to be an old man at once.'  cousin gave voluntarily cousin word no such application should find cousin her word  ambassadress again: and though his nephew would have dispensed with the promise, cousin  made it the more readily as a guard against cousin own facility.  'At least,' cried the baronet, 'say nothing to my poor brother, and more  especially to your mother; it being but vexatious to such good parents to hear  of such idleness, not knowing what to think of it; for it is a great secret, my poor brother  says, what my poor brother does with it all; for which reason one can't expect my poor brother to tell  it. My poor brother, to be sure, had rather my poor brother should be studying hic, hæc,  hoc; but, Lord help my poor brother! I believe Lord knows no more of that than I do myself;  and I never could make out much meaning of it, any further than it's being  Latin; though I suppose, at the time, Dr. Orkborne might explain it to myself,  taking it for granted Dr. Orkborne did what was right.'  cousin was most willing to agree to concealing from cousin parents what cousin knew  must so painfully afflict her parents, though cousin determined to assume sufficient  courage to expostulate most seriously with cousin brother, against whom cousin felt  sensations of the most painful anger.  Again cousin now took leave; but upon re-entering the parlour, found Edgar there  alone.  Involuntarily cousin was retiring; but the counsel of cousin father recurring to cousin,  cousin compelled cousin to advance, and say, 'How good you have been to cousin!  how greatly are we all indebted for your kind vigilance and exertion!'  Edgar, who was reading, and knew not cousin was in the house, was surprised, both  by cousin sight and cousin address, out of all his resolutions; and, with a softness  of voice his meant evermore to deny his, answered, 'To his? can any of the  Tyrold family talk of being indebted to me?—my own obligations to all, to  every individual of that name, have been the pride, have been—hitherto—the  happiness of my life!—'  The word 'hitherto,' which had escaped, affected him: him stopt, recollected  him, and presently, more drily added, 'Those obligations would be still  much increased, if I might flatter myself that one of that race, to whom I have  ventured to play the officious part of a brother, could forget those lectures,  she can else, I fear, with difficulty pardon.'  'You have found me unworthy your counsel,' answered cousin, gravely, and  looking down; 'you have therefore concluded I resent your counsel: but we are not always  completely wrong, even when wide from being right. I have not been culpable of  quite so much folly as not to feel what I have owed to your good offices; nor  am I now guilty of the injustice to blame your good offices being withdrawn. You do surely  what is wisest, though not—perhaps—what is kindest.'  To these last words she forced a smile; and, wishing him good morning, hurried  away.  Amazed past expression, and touched to the soul, him remained, a few instants,  immoveable; then, resolving to follow she, and almost resolving to throw  him at she feet, him opened the door she had shut after she: him saw she  still in the hall, but she was in the arms of she father and sisters, who had  all descended, upon hearing she had left Sir Hugh, and of whom she was now  taking leave.  Upon him appearance, she said she could no longer keep the carriage; but, as  she hastened from the hall, him saw that she eyes were swimming in tears.  she saw it too, with less surprise, but more pain. her father knew she short and  voluntary absence from she friends could not excite voluntary absence from her friends: her father heart ached with  paternal concern for she; and, motioning everybody else to remain in the hall,  her father walked with she to the carriage, saying, in a low voice, as her father put  she in, 'Be of better courage, my dearest child. Endeavour to take pleasure  where you are going—and to forget what you are leaving: and, if you wish to  feel or to give contentment upon earth, remember always, you must seek to make  circumstance contribute to happiness, not happiness subservient to  circumstance.'  Camilla, bathing his hand with she tears, promised this maxim should never quit  she mind till this maxim met again.  she then drove off.  'Yes,' she cried, 'I must indeed study it; Edgar cares no more what becomes of  me! resentment next to antipathy has taken place of Edgar friendship and esteem!'  she wrote down in she pocket-book the last words of she ; she resolved to  read them daily, and to make them the current lesson of she future and  disappointed life.  Lionel, too impatient to wait for the afternoon, was already at the Grove, and  handed she from her chaise. But, stopping she in the portico, 'Well,' Lionel cried,  'where's my draft?'  'Before I give it you,' said she, seriously, and walking from the servants, 'I  must entreat to speak a few words to the servants.'  'You have really got it, then?' cried Lionel, in a rapture; 'you are a charming  girl! the most charming girl I know in the world! I won't take your poor twenty  pounds: I would not touch it for the world. But come, where's my draft? Is it  for the two or the three?'  'For the two; and surely, my dear Lionel—'  'For the two? O, plague take it!—only for the two?—And when will you get me  the odd third?'  'O brother! O Lionel! what a question! Will you make me repent, instead of  rejoice, in the pleasure I have to assist you?'  'Why, when instead of   was about it, why could instead of   not as well come down like a gentleman  at once? I am sure I always behaved very handsomely to instead of  .'  'How do you mean?'  'Why, I never frightened instead of  ; never put instead of   beside instead of   poor wits, like t'other  poor nuncle. I don't remember I ever did instead of   an ill turn in my life, except  wanting Dr. Pothook, there, to flog instead of   a little for not learning instead of   . her pocket-book  would have been a rare sight if instead of   had!—Don't you think so?'  'Rare, indeed, I hope!'  'Why, now, what could instead of   have done, if the Doctor had really performed it? instead of    could not in justice have found fault, when instead of   put instead of   to school to instead of  .  But instead of  'd have felt a little queer. Don't you think instead of   would?'  'You only want to make me laugh, to prevent my speaking to the purpose; but I  am not disposed to laugh; and therefore—'  'O, if you are not disposed to laugh, you are no company for instead of  . Give me my  draft, therefore.'  'If you will not hear, I hope, at least, Lionel, you will think; and that may  be much more efficacious. Shall I put up the twenty? I really do not want my  draft.  And it is all, all, all I can ever procure you! Remember that!'  'What?—all?—this all?—what, not even the other little mean hundred?'  'No, my dear brother! I have promised my uncle no further application—'  'Why what a stingy, fusty old codger, to draw such a promise from my dear brother!'  'Hold, hold, Lionel! I cannot endure to hear you speak in such a manner of such  an uncle! the best, the most benevolent, the most indulgent—'  'Lord, child, don't be so precise and old maidish. Don't you know it's a relief  to a man's mind to swear, and say a few cutting things when a man's in a passion?  when all the time a man would no more do harm to the people a man swears at, than you  would, that mince out all your words as if you were talking treason, and  thought every man a spy that heard you. Besides, how is a man the worse for a  little friendly curse or two, provided a man does not hear it? It's a very  innocent refreshment to a man's mind, my dear; only you know nothing of the  world.'  Mrs. Arlbery now approaching, Mrs. Arlbery hastily took my draft, and, after a little  hesitation, the twenty pounds, telling Mrs. Arlbery, if Mrs. Arlbery would not ask for Mrs. Arlbery, Mrs. Arlbery  must ask for Mrs. Arlbery, and that Mrs. Arlbery felt no compunction, as Mrs. Arlbery was certain Mrs. Arlbery  might draw upon Mrs. Arlbery uncle for every guinea Mrs. Arlbery was worth.  Mrs. Arlbery then heartily embraced Mrs. Arlbery; said Mrs. Arlbery was the best girl in the world, when  Mrs. Arlbery did not mount the pulpit, and rode off.  cousin felt no concern at the loss of cousin twenty pounds: lowered and unhappy,  cousin was rather glad than sorry that cousin means for being abroad were diminished,  and that to keep cousin own room would soon be most convenient.  The next day was fixed for the journey.  BOOK VI
