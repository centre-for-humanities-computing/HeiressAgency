 A Sermon  The kind reception of Mrs. Arlbery, and all the animation of her discourse,  were thrown away upon Camilla. An absent smile, and a few faint acknowledgments  of her goodness were all she could return: Eugenia abandoned when she might  have been served, Edgar contemning when he might have been approving ... these  were the images of her mind, which resisted entrance to all other.  Tired of fruitless attempts to amuse her, Mrs. Arlbery, upon their arrival at  the Grove, conducted her to an apartment prepared for her, and made use of no  persuasion that she would leave it before dinner.  Camilla then, too unhappy to fear any injunction, and resigned to whatever she  might receive, read the discourse of Mr. Tyrold.  For Miss Camilla Tyrold.  It is not my intention to enumerate, my dear Camilla, the many blessings of  your situation; your heart is just and affectionate, and will not forget them:  I mean but to place before you your immediate duties, satisfied that the review  will ensure their performance.  Unused to, because undeserving control, your days, to this period, have been as  gay as your spirits. It is now first that your tranquillity is ruffled; it is  now, therefore, that your fortitude has its first debt to pay for its hitherto  happy exemption.  Those who weigh the calamities of life only by the positive, the substantial,  or the irremediable mischiefs which they produce, regard the first sorrows of  early youth as too trifling for compassion. They do not enough consider that it  is the suffering, not its abstract cause, which demands human commiseration.  The man who loses his whole fortune, yet possesses firmness, philosophy, a  disdain of ambition, and an accommodation to circumstances, is less an object  of contemplative pity, than the person who, without one real deprivation, one  actual evil, is first, or is suddenly forced to recognise the fallacy of a  cherished and darling hope.  That its foundation has always been shallow is no mitigation of disappointment  to him who had only viewed it in its super-structure. Nor is its downfall less  terrible to its visionary elevator, because others had seen it from the  beginning as a folly or a chimæra; its dissolution should be estimated, not by  its romance in the unimpassioned examination of a rational looker on, but by  its believed promise of felicity to its credulous projector.  Is my Camilla in this predicament? had she wove her own destiny in the  speculation of her wishes? Alas! to blame her, I must first forget, that  delusion, while in force, has all the semblance of reality, and takes the same  hold upon the faculties as truth. Nor is it till the spell is broken, till the  perversion of reason and error of judgment become wilful, that Scorn ought to  point 'its finger' or Censure its severity.  But of this I have no fear. The love of right is implanted indelibly in your  nature, and your own peace is as dependant as mine and as your mother's upon  its constant culture.  Your conduct hitherto has been committed to yourself. Satisfied with  establishing your principles upon the adamantine pillars of religion and  conscience, we have not feared leaving you the entire possession of general  liberty. Nor do I mean to withdraw it, though the present state of your  affairs, and what for some time past I have painfully observed of your  precipitance, oblige me to add partial counsel to standing precept, and  exhortation to advice. I shall give them, however, with diffidence, fairly  acknowledging and blending my own perplexities with yours.  The temporal destiny of woman is enwrapt in still more impenetrable obscurity  than that of man. She begins her career by being involved in all the worldly  accidents of a parent; she continues it by being associated in all that may  environ a husband: and the difficulties arising from this doubly appendant  state, are augmented by the next to impossibility, that the first dependance  should pave the way for the ultimate. What parent yet has been gifted with the  foresight to say, 'I will educate my daughter for the station to which she  shall belong?' Let us even suppose that station to be fixed by himself, rarely  as the chances of life authorise such a presumption; his daughter all duty, and  the partner of his own selection solicitous of the alliance: is he at all more  secure he has provided even for her external welfare? What, in this sublunary  existence, is the state from which she shall neither rise nor fall? Who shall  say that in a few years, a few months, perhaps less, the situation in which the  prosperity of his own views has placed her, may not change for one more humble  than he has fitted her for enduring, or more exalted than he has accomplished  her for sustaining? The conscience, indeed, of the father is not responsible  for events, but the infelicity of the daughter is not less a subject of pity.  Again, if none of these outward and obvious vicissitudes occur, the proper  education of a female, either for use or for happiness, is still to seek, still  a problem beyond human solution; since its refinement, or its negligence, can  only prove to her a good or an evil, according to the humour of the husband  into whose hands she may fall. If fashioned to shine in the great world, he may  deem the metropolis all turbulence; if endowed with every resource for  retirement, he may think the country distasteful. And though her talents, her  acquirements, may in either of these cases be set aside, with an only silent  regret of wasted youth and application; the turn of mind which they have  induced, the appreciation which they have taught of time, of pleasure, or of  utility, will have nurtured inclinations and opinions not so ductile to new  sentiments and employments, and either submission becomes a hardship, or  resistance generates dissention.  If such are the parental embarrassments, against which neither wisdom nor  experience can guard, who should view the filial without sympathy and  tenderness?  You have been brought up, my dear child, without any specific expectation. Your  mother and myself, mutually deliberating upon the uncertainty of the female  fate, determined to educate our girls with as much simplicity as is compatible  with instruction, as much docility for various life as may accord with  invariable principles, and as much accommodation with the world at large, as  may combine with a just distinction of selected society. We hoped, thus, should  your lots be elevated, to secure you from either exulting arrogance, or bashful  insignificance; or should they, as is more probable, be lowly, to instil into  your understandings and characters such a portion of intellectual vigour as  should make you enter into an humbler scene without debasement, helplessness,  or repining.  It is now, Camilla, we must demand your exertions in return. Let not these  cares, to fit you for the world as you may find it, be utterly annihilated from  doing you good, by the uncombated sway of an unavailing, however well-placed  attachment.  We will not here canvass the equity of that freedom by which women as well as  men should be allowed to dispose of their own affections. There cannot, in  nature, in theory, nor even in common sense, be a doubt of their equal right:  but disquisitions on this point will remain rather curious than important, till  the speculatist can superinduce to the abstract truth of the position some  proof of its practicability.  Meanwhile, it is enough for every modest and reasonable young woman to  consider, that where there are two parties, choice can belong only to one of  them: and then let her call upon all her feelings of delicacy, all her notions  of propriety, to decide: Since Man must choose Woman, or Woman Man, which  should come forward to make the choice? Which should retire to be chosen?  A prepossession directed towards a virtuous and deserving object wears, in its  first approach, the appearance of a mere tribute of justice to merit. It seems,  therefore, too natural, perhaps too generous, to be considered either as a  folly or a crime. It is only its encouragement where it is not reciprocal, that  can make it incur the first epithet, or where it ought not to be reciprocal  that can brand it with the second. With respect to this last, I know of nothing  to apprehend:—with regard to the first—I grieve to wound my dearest  Camilla, yet where there has been no subject for complaint, there can have been  none for expectation.  Struggle then against yourself as you would struggle against an enemy. Refuse  to listen to a wish, to dwell even upon a possibility, that opens to your  present idea of happiness. All that in future may be realised probably hangs  upon this conflict. I mean not to propose to you in the course of a few days to  reinstate yourself in the perfect security of a disengaged mind. I know too  much of the human heart to be ignorant that the acceleration, or delay, must  depend upon circumstance: I can only require from you what depends upon  yourself, a steady and courageous warfare against the two dangerous underminers  of your peace and of your fame, imprudence and impatience. You have champions  with which to encounter them that cannot fail of success, ... good sense and  delicacy.  Good sense will shew you the power of self-conquest, and point out its means.  It will instruct you to curb those unguarded movements which lay you open to  the strictures of others. It will talk to you of those boundaries which custom  forbids your sex to pass, and the hazard of any individual attempt to  transgress them. It will tell you, that where allowed only a negative choice,  it is your own best interest to combat against a positive wish. It will bid  you, by constant occupation, vary those thoughts that now take but one  direction, and multiply those interests which now recognise but one object: and  it will soon convince you, that it is not strength of mind which you want, but  reflection, to obtain a strict and unremitting control over your passions.  This last word will pain, but let it not shock you. You have no passions, my  innocent girl, at which you need blush, though enough at which I must  tremble!—For in what consists your constraint, your forbearance? your wish is  your guide, your impulse is your action. Alas! never yet was mortal created so  perfect, that every wish was virtuous, or every impulse wise!  Does a secret murmur here demand: if a discerning predilection is no crime,  why, internally at least, may it not be cherished? whom can it injure or  offend, that, in the hidden recesses of my own breast, I nourish superior  preference of superior worth?  This is the question with which every young woman beguiles her fancy; this is  the common but seductive opiate, with which inclination lulls reason.  The answer may be safely comprised in a brief appeal to her own breast.  I do not desire her to be insensible to merit; I do not even demand she should  confine her social affections to her own sex, since the most innocent esteem is  equally compatible, though not equally general with ours: I require of her  simply, that, in her secret hours, when pride has no dominion, and disguise  would answer no purpose, she will ask herself this question, 'Could I calmly  hear that this elect of my heart was united to another? Were I to be informed  that the indissoluble knot was tied, which annihilates all my own future  possibilities, would the news occasion me no affliction?' This, and this alone,  is the test by which she may judge the danger, or the harmlessness of her  attachment.  I have now endeavoured to point out the obligations which you may owe to good  sense. Your obligations to delicacy will be but their consequence.  Delicacy is an attribute so peculiarly feminine, that were your reflections  less agitated by your feelings, you could delineate more distinctly than myself  its appropriate laws, its minute exactions, its sensitive refinements. Here,  therefore, I seek but to bring back to your memory what livelier sensations  have inadvertently driven from it.  You may imagine, in the innocency of your heart, that what you would rather  perish than utter can never, since untold, be suspected: and, at present, I am  equally sanguine in believing no surmise to have been conceived where most it  would shock you: yet credit me when I assure you, that you can make no greater  mistake, than to suppose that you have any security beyond what sedulously you  must earn by the most indefatigable vigilance. There are so many ways of  communication independent of speech, that silence is but one point in the  ordinances of discretion. You have nothing, in so modest a character, to  apprehend from vanity or presumption; you may easily, therefore, continue the  guardian of your own dignity: but you must keep in mind, that our perceptions  want but little quickening to discern what may flatter them; and it is mutual  to either sex to be to no gratification so alive, as to that of a conscious  ascendance over the other.  Nevertheless, the female who, upon the softening blandishment of an undisguised  prepossession, builds her expectation of its reciprocity, is, in common, most  cruelly deceived. It is not that she has failed to awaken tenderness; but it  has been tenderness without respect: nor yet that the person thus elated has  been insensible to flattery; but it has been a flattery to raise himself, not  its exciter in his esteem. The partiality which we feel inspires diffidence:  that which we create has a contrary effect. A certainty of success in many  destroys, in all weakens, its charm: the bashful excepted, to whom it gives  courage; and the indolent, to whom it saves trouble.  Carefully, then, beyond all other care, shut up every avenue by which a secret  which should die untold can further escape you. Avoid every species of  particularity; neither shun nor seek any intercourse apparently; and in such  meetings as general prudence may render necessary, or as accident may make  inevitable, endeavour to behave with the same open esteem as in your days of  unconsciousness. The least unusual attention would not be more suspicious to  the world, than the least undue reserve to the subject of our discussion.  Coldness or distance could only be imputed to resentment; and resentment, since  you have received no offence, how, should it be investigated, could you  vindicate? or how, should it be passed in silence, secure from being attributed  to pique and disappointment?  There is also another motive, important to us all, which calls for the most  rigid circumspection. The person in question is not merely amiable; he is also  rich: mankind at large, therefore, would not give merely to a sense of  excellence any obvious predilection. This hint will, I know, powerfully operate  upon your disinterested spirit.  Never from personal experience may you gather, how far from soothing, how wide  from honourable, is the species of compassion ordinarily diffused by the  discovery of an unreturned female regard. That it should be felt unsought may  be considered as a mark of discerning sensibility; but that it should be  betrayed uncalled for, is commonly, however ungenerously, imagined rather to  indicate ungoverned passions, than refined selection. This is often both cruel  and unjust; yet, let me ask—Is the world a proper confident for such a  secret? Can the woman who has permitted it to go abroad, reasonably demand that  consideration and respect from the community, in which she has been wanting to  herself? To me it would be unnecessary to observe, that her indiscretion may  have been the effect of an inadvertence which owes its origin to artlessness,  not to forwardness: She is judged by those, who, hardened in the ways of men,  accustom themselves to trace in evil every motive to action; or by those, who,  preferring ridicule to humanity, seek rather to amuse themselves wittily with  her susceptibility, than to feel for its innocence and simplicity.  In a state of utter constraint, to appear natural is, however, an effort too  difficult to be long sustained; and neither precept, example, nor disposition,  have enured my poor child to the performance of any studied part. Discriminate,  nevertheless, between hypocrisy and discretion. The first is a vice; the second  a conciliation to virtue. It is the bond that keeps society from disunion; the  veil that shades our weakness from exposure, giving time for that interior  correction, which the publication of our infirmities would else, with respect  to mankind, make of no avail.  It were better no doubt, worthier, nobler, to meet the scrutiny of our  fellow-creatures by consent, as we encounter, per force, the all-viewing eye of  our Creator: but since for this we are not sufficiently without blemish, we  must allow to our unstable virtues all the encouragement that can prop them.  The event of discovered faults is more frequently callousness than amendment;  and propriety of example is as much a duty to our fellow-creatures, as purity  of intention is a debt to ourselves.  To delicacy, in fine, your present exertions will owe their future recompence,  be your ultimate lot in life what it may. Should you, in the course of time,  belong to another, you will be shielded from the regret that a former  attachment had been published; or should you continue mistress of yourself,  from a blush that the world is acquainted it was not by your choice.  I shall now conclude this little discourse by calling upon you to annex to  whatever I have offered you of precept, the constant remembrance of your mother  for example.  In our joint names, therefore, I adjure you, my dearest Camilla, not to  embitter the present innocence of your suffering by imprudence that may attach  to it censure, nor by indulgence that may make it fasten upon your vitals!  Imprudence cannot but end in the demolition of that dignified equanimity, and  modest propriety, which we wish to be uniformly remarked as the attributes of  your character: and indulgence, by fixing, may envenom a dart that as yet may  be gently withdrawn, from a wound which kindness may heal, and time may close;  but which, if neglected, may wear away, in corroding disturbance, all your  life's comfort to yourself, and all its social purposes to your friends and to  the world.  Augustus Tyrold.
