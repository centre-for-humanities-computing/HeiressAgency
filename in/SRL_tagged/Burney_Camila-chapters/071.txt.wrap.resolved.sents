 A Proposal of Marriage  The increasing depression of Camilla, and the melancholy of Camilla sympathising  sisters, though still attributed to the adverse wind by the compass-watching  baronet, escaped not the notice of Mr. Tyrold; who, alarmed for the peace of  Mr. Tyrold daughter, determined to watch for the first quiet opportunity of  investigating Camilla actual situation.
Lionel, after breakfast, the next morning, was obliged to relinquish waiting  for Clermont, and to set off for Oxford.
Lionel contrived to whisper to Camilla,  that Lionel hoped Camilla would be a good girl at last, and not play the fool; but,  finding Camilla only sighed, Lionel laughed at Camilla calamitious state, in becoming  mistress of fifteen thousand per annum, only by the small trouble of running  over a short ceremony; and, assuring Camilla he would assist Camilla off with part of  the charge, if it were too heavy for Camilla, bid Camilla inform Lionel in time of the  propitious day.
Camilla, shortly after, saw from Camilla window, galloping full speed across the  park to the house, Major Cerwood.
Camilla suspected Camilla tormenting brother to have  been again at work; nor was Camilla mistaken.
Lionel had met with the Major at the  hotel at Tunbridge, while Lionel spirits, always violent, were in a state of  almost intoxication of delight, at the first idea of such an accession to Lionel  powers of amusement, as a new brother rolling in immense wealth, which Lionel  already considered as nearly at Lionel own disposal.
High wrought, therefore, for  what Lionel deemed good sport, Lionel confirmed what Lionel had asserted at the ball at  Northwick, of the expectations of Camilla from Sir Hugh, by relating the public  fact, of Camilla having been announced, to the family and neighbourhood, for his  uncle's heiress, at ten years of age; and only sinking, in his account, the  revocation made so soon after in favour of Eugenia.
To this, his added his  advice, that no time was to be lost, as numberless new suitors were likely to  pursue Camilla from Tunbridge.
The Major, upon alighting, inquired for Sir Hugh, deeming Mr. Tyrold of little  consequence, since it was not from Mr. Tyrold Camilla was to inherit Camilla fortune.
The baronet, as usual, was watching the winds and the clouds; but, concluding  whoever came would bring some news from Clermont, received The Major with the  utmost cordiality, saying: 'I see, sir, you are a stranger; by which I suppose  you to be just come from abroad; where, I hope, you left all well?'
'I am just come, sir,' answered The Major, 'from Tunbridge, where I had the  honour, through my acquaintance with Mrs. Arlbery, of meeting daily with your  charming niece; an honour, sir, which must cause all the future happiness or  misery of my life.'
sir then made a declaration, in form, of the most ardent passion for Camilla;  mentioned sir family, which was an honourable one; talked of sir expectations  with confidence, though vaguely; and desired to leave the disposition of the  settlement wholly to The baronet; who, sir hoped, would not refuse to see sir  elder brother, a gentleman of fortune in Lincolnshire, who would have the  honour to wait upon sir, at any time sir would be so good as to appoint, upon  this momentous affair.
sir heard this harangue with consternation.
The Major was in the prime of  life, sir person was good, sir speech was florid, sir air was assured, and sir  regimentals were gay.
Not a doubt of sir success occurred to The baronet; who  saw, in one blow, the darling scheme of sir old age demolished, in the  deprivation of Camilla.
The Major impatiently waited for an answer; but sir was too much  disordered to frame one; sir walked up and down the room, muttering in a  desponding manner, to sir, 'sir, help The Major!
what a set of poor weak mortals  The Major are, The Major poor men!
The best schemes and plans in the world always coming to  nothing before The Major can bring The best schemes and plans in the world about!
I'll never form another while I live,  for the sake of this one warning.
Nobody knows, next, but what Clermont will be  carrying off Eugenia to see foreign parts!
and then comes some other of these  red-coats to take away Indiana; and, after doing all for the best so long, I  may be left all alone, except just for Mrs. Margland and the Doctor!
that I  don't take much pleasure in, sir help me!
except as a Christian, which I hope  is no sin.'
At length, endeavouring to compose a Christian, which I hope  is no sin.'
, a Christian, which I hope  is no sin.'
sat down, and said, 'So you are  come, sir, to take away from a Christian, which I hope  is no sin.'
my own particular little niece?
which is a hard  thing upon an uncle, intending my own particular little niece to live with a Christian, which I hope  is no sin.'
.
However, I don't mean to  find fault; but I can tell you this one thing, sir, which I beg you to  remember; which is, if you don't make my own particular little niece happy, you'll break my heart!
For  my own particular little niece's what I love the best in the world, little as I've made it appear, by not  leaving my own particular little niece a shilling.
For which sake, however, I can't but respect you the  more for coming after my own particular little niece, instead of Eugenia.'
'sir?'
cried the Major, amazed.
'The other two chaps,' continued sir, 'that came about us not long ago, wanted  to make The other two chaps,' court to Eugenia and Indiana; as well as another that came to the  house when I was ill, in the same coat as yourself, by what I can gather from  the description; but never a one has come to Camilla yet, except yourself,  because my brother can spare Camilla but a trifle, having another young girl to  provide for, besides Lionel; which is the most expensive of them all, poor boy!
never having enough, by the reason Oxford is so dear, as I suppose.'
the Major now wore an air of surprise and uneasiness that Sir Hugh began to  observe, but attributed to Sir Hugh unpleasant reception of Sir Hugh proposals.
Sir Hugh begged  Sir Hugh pardon, therefore, and again assured Sir Hugh of Sir Hugh respect for a choice so  little mercenary, which Sir Hugh looked upon as a mark of a good heart.
The Major, completely staggered, and suspecting the information of Lionel to be  ill grounded, if not purposely deluding, entreated Lionel permission to wait upon  Lionel again; and offered for the present to take leave.
Sir Hugh, in a melancholy voice, said, Sir Hugh would first summon Sir Hugh niece, as Sir Hugh  could not answer it to Sir Hugh conscience preventing the meeting, unless his niece gave  Sir Hugh leave.
Sir Hugh then rang the bell, and told Jacob to call Camilla.
Major Cerwood was excessively distressed.
To retreat seemed impossible; yet to  connect himself without fortune, when himself thought himself was addressing a rich  heiress, was a turn of fate himself scarcely knew how either to support or to parry.
All that, in this haste, himself could resolve, was, to let the matter pass for the  moment, and then insist upon satisfaction from Lionel, either in clearing up  the mistake, or taking upon himself its blame.
When Camilla appeared, the disturbance of Sir Hugh still augmented; and Sir Hugh  could hardly articulate, 'My dear, in the case you are willing to leave your  family, here's a gentleman come to make Sir Hugh addresses to you; which I think his addresses  right you should know, though how I shall struggle through his addresses, if I lose you,  is more than my poor weak head can tell; for what shall I do without my dear  little girl, that I thought to make the best comfort of my old age?
which,  however, I beg you not to think of, in case this young Captain's more  agreeable.'
'Ah!
my dear uncle!'
cried Camilla, 'Camilla Camilla can never return half the comfort  Camilla receives from Camilla!
keep me with Camilla still, and ever!
I am much obliged to  Major Cerwood.
I beg this young Captain to accept my sincerest thanks; but to pardon me, when  I assure this young Captain, they are all I have to offer this young Captain.'
Repulse was not new to the Major; who, in various country towns, had sought to  retrieve his affairs by some prudent connection; his pride, however, had never  so little suffered as on the present occasion, for his apprehension of error or  imposition had removed from his all thought of even the possibility of a  refusal; which, now, therefore, unexpectedly and joyfully obviated his  embarrassment, and enabled his to quit the field by an honourable retreat.
his  bowed profoundly, called his, without knowing what his said, the most  unhappy of men; and, without risking one solicitation, or a moment for  repentance, hastily took leave, with intention, immediately, to demand an  explanation of Lionel.
But his had not escaped a mile from the  house, ere his gave up that design, from  anticipating the ridicule that might follow that design.
To require satisfaction for a  young lady's want of fortune, however reasonable, would always be derided as  ludicrous.
his resolved, therefore, quietly to put up with the rejection; and to  gather his next documents concerning the portion of a fair damsel, from  authority better to be relied upon than that of a brother.
sir, for some time, discovered not that sir had retired.
Enchanted by so  unexpected a dismission, sir favourite scheme of life seemed accorded to sir,  and sir pressed Camilla to sir bosom, in a transport of joy.
'We shall live  together, now, I hope,' sir cried, 'without any of these young chaps coming in  again to part We.
Not that I would object to your marrying, my dear girl, if it  was with a relation, like Eugenia, or, with a neighbour, like Indiana, if it  had not been for it   going off; but to see you taken away from me by a mere  stranger, coming from distant parts, and knowing nothing of any of us, is a  thing that makes my heart ache but to think of; so I hope it will happen no  more; for these trials do no good to my recovery.'
Turning round, then, with a view to say something consolatory to The Major, he  was seriously concerned to find he departed.
'I can't say,' he cried, 'I had  any intention to send he off so short, he meaning not being bad, considering  he in the light of a person in love; which is a time when a man has not much  thought, except for a man, by what I can gather.'
a man then proposed a walk, to watch if Clermont were coming.
The wind, a man  acknowledged, was indeed contrary; but, a man did not doubt, upon such a  particular occasion, a man good lad would not mind such difficulties.
