 Knowle  The last words of Camilla to Mandlebert, in quitting Cleves, and the tears with  which  Knowle   saw Camilla eyes overflowing, had annihilated all  Knowle   resentment, and left   Knowle   no wish but to serve Camilla. Camilla distinction between what was wisest and what  was kindest, had penetrated  Knowle   to the quick. To be thought capable of severity  towards so sweet a young creature, the daughter of  Knowle   guardian,  Knowle   juvenile  companion, and earliest favourite, made  Knowle   detestable in her eyes.  Knowle    languished to follow Camilla, to apologise for what had hurt Camilla, and to vow to Camilla  a fair and disinterested friendship for the rest of  Knowle   life: and  Knowle   only  forced  Knowle  , from decency, to stay out  Knowle   promised week with the baronet,  before  Knowle   set out for Tunbridge.  Upon  Knowle   arrival, which was late,  Knowle   went immediately to the Rooms; but  Knowle   only  saw Camilla name in the books, and learnt, upon inquiring for Mrs. Arlbery, that  Camilla and Camilla party were already retired.  Glad to find Camilla so sober in hours,  Knowle   went to the hotel, meaning quietly to  read till bed-time, and to call upon Camilla the next morning.  In a few moments, a voice struck  Knowle   ear that effectually interrupted  Knowle    studies. It was a voice. Camilla at an hotel at past eleven  o'clock!  Knowle   knew Camilla did not lodge there;  Knowle   had seen, in the books, the  direction of Mrs. Arlbery at Mount Pleasant. Mrs. Arlbery's voice  Knowle   also  distinguished, Sir Sedley Clarendel's, General Kinsale's, and, least of all  welcome, ... the Major's.  Perhaps, however, some lady, some intimate friend of Mrs. Arlbery, was just  arrived, and had made some lady, some intimate friend of Mrs. Arlbery spend the evening there.  Knowle   rang for  Knowle   man, and  bid  Knowle   inquire who had taken the next room, ... and learnt the next room was Sir Sedley  Clarendel.  To visit a young man at an hotel; rich, handsome, and splendid; and with a  chaperon so far from past her prime, so elegant, so coquetish, so alluring, and  still so pretty; and to meet there a flashy Officer, her open pursuer and  avowed admirer—'Tis true,  Knowle   had concluded, Tunbridge and the Major were one;  but not thus, not with such glaring impropriety;  Knowle   love,  Knowle   told  Knowle  , was  past; but  Knowle   esteem was still susceptible, and now grievously wounded.  To read was impossible. To hold  Knowle   watch in  Knowle   hand, and count the minutes  her still stayed, was all to which  Knowle   faculties were equal. No words  distinctly reached  Knowle  ; that the conversation was lively, the tone of every  voice announced, but when that of Camilla struck  Knowle   by that of Camilla laughter, the depth  of  Knowle   concern drew from  Knowle   a sigh that was heard into the next apartment.  Of this, with infinite vexation,  Knowle   was  Knowle   aware, from the sudden silence  and pause of all discourse which ensued. Ashamed both of what  Knowle   felt and what   Knowle   betrayed,  Knowle   grew more upon  Knowle   guard, and hoped it might never be known to  whom the room belonged.  When, however, as they were retiring, a scream reached  Knowle   ear, though  Knowle   knew  it was not the voice of Camilla,  Knowle   could not command  Knowle  , and rushed forth  with a light; but the lady who screamed was as little noticed as thought of:  the Major was holding the hand of Camilla, and  Knowle   eye could take in no more:   Knowle   saw not even that Mrs. Arlbery was there; and when roused by Mrs. Arlbery question,  all voice was denied  Knowle   for answer;  Knowle   stood motionless even after they had  descended the stairs, till the steps of the General and the Major, retiring to  they chambers, brought to  Knowle   some recollection, and enabled  Knowle   to retreat.  Fully now, as well as cruelly convinced, of the unabated force of  Knowle   unhappy  passion,  Knowle   spent the night in extreme wretchedness; and all that was not  swallowed up in repining and regret, was devoted to ruminate upon what possible  means  Knowle   could suggest, to restore to  Knowle   the tranquillity of indifference.  The confusion of Camilla persuaded  Knowle   Camilla thought Camilla was acting wrong; but  whether from disapprobation of the character of the Major, or from any  pecuniary obstacles to their union,  Knowle   could not devise. To assist the marriage  according to  Knowle   former plan, would best,  Knowle   still believed, sooth  Knowle   internal  sufferings, if once  Knowle   could fancy the Major at all worthy of such a wife. But  Camilla, with all Camilla inconsistencies,  Knowle   thought a treasure unequalled: and to  contribute to bestow Camilla on a man who, probably, only prized Camilla for Camilla  beauty,  Knowle   now persuaded  Knowle   would rather be culpable than generous.  Upon the whole, therefore,  Knowle   could resolve only upon a complete change of  Knowle    last system; to seek, instead of avoiding Camilla; to familiarise  Knowle   with Camilla  faults, till  Knowle   ceased to doat upon Camilla virtues; to discover if Camilla  difficulties were mental or worldly; to enforce her  difficulties were mental or worldly if the first, and ...  whatever it might cost  Knowle  —to invalidate her  difficulties were mental or worldly if the last.  This plan, the only one  Knowle   could form, abated  Knowle   misery. It reconciled  Knowle   to  residing where Camilla resided, it was easy to  Knowle  , therefore, to conclude it  the least objectionable.  Camilla, meanwhile, in Camilla way to Mount Pleasant, spoke not a syllable. Dismay  that Edgar should have seen Camilla so situated, while in ignorance how it had  happened, made an uneasiness the most terrible combat the perplexed pleasure,  that lightened, yet palpitated in Camilla bosom, from the view of Edgar at  Tunbridge, and from the sigh which had reached Camilla ears. Yet, was it for Camilla he  sighed? was it not, rather, from some secret inquietude, in which Camilla was  wholly uninterested, and might never know? Still, however, he was at Tunbridge;  still, therefore, Camilla might hope something relative to Camilla induced he  coming; and Camilla determined, with respect to Camilla own behaviour, to observe the  injunctions of Camilla father, whose letter Camilla would regularly read every morning.  Mrs. Arlbery, also, spoke not; the unexpected sight of Mandlebert occupied all  Mrs. Arlbery thoughts; yet, though he confusion was suspicious, Mrs. Arlbery could not,  ultimately, believe he loved Camilla, as Mrs. Arlbery could suggest no possible  impediment to he proclaiming any regard he entertained. he sigh Mrs. Arlbery imagined  as likely to be mere lassitude as love; and supposed, that having long  discovered the partiality of Camilla, he vanity had been confounded by the  devoirs of the Major.  Miss Dennel, therefore, was the only one whose voice was heard during the ride;  for now completely awaked, Mrs. Arlbery talked without cessation of the fright Mrs. Arlbery had  endured. 'La, I thought,' cried Mrs. Arlbery, 'when I tumbled down, somebody threw me  down on purpose, and was going to kill me! dear me! I thought I should have  died! And then I thought it was a robber; and then I thought that candle that  come was a ghost! O la! I never was so frightened in my life!'  The next morning they went, as usual, to the Pantiles, and Mrs. Arlbery took  Mrs. Arlbery seat in the bookseller's shop, where the usual beaux were encountered; and  where, presently, Edgar entering, addressed to Mrs. Arlbery some discourse, and made  some general inquiries after the health of Camilla.  It was a cruel drawback to Mrs. Arlbery hopes to see him first thus in public: but the  manner of Mrs. Arlbery at the hotel, him had thought repulsive; him had observed  that Mrs. Arlbery seemed offended with him since the rencounter at the breakfast given  for Miss Dennel; and him now wished for some encouragement for renewing him  rights to the acquaintance.  Sir Sedley, though with the assistance of a stick Sir Sedley had reached the library,  was not sufficiently at Sir Sedley ease to again mount Sir Sedley horse; a carriage  expedition was therefore agitating for the morning, and to see Knowle being  fixed upon, equipages and horses were ordered.  While they waited they arrival. Lady Alithea Selmore, and a very shewy train  of ladies and gentlemen, came into the library. Sir Sedley, losing the easy,  natural manner which had just so much pleased Camilla, resumed Sir Sedley affectation,  indolence, and inattention, and flung Sir Sedley back in Sir Sedley chair, without  finishing a speech Sir Sedley had begun, or listening to an inquiry why Sir Sedley stopt short.  Sir Sedley friends, Lord Newford and Sir Theophilus Jarard, shuffled up to her  ladyship; and Sir Sedley, muttering to Sir Sedley life would not be life without  being introduced to her, got up, and seizing Lord Newford by the shoulder,  whispered what Sir Sedley called the height of Sir Sedley ambition, and was presented without  delay.  Sir Sedley then entered into a little abrupt, half articulated conversation with Lady  Alithea, who, by a certain toss of the chin, a short and half scornful laugh,  and a supercilious dropping of the eye, gave to every sentence her uttered the  air of a bon mot; and after each, as regularly stopt for some testimony of  admiration, as a favourite actress in some scene in which every speech is  applauded. What her said, indeed, had no other mark than what this manner gave  to this manner; for it was neither good nor bad, wise nor foolish, sprightly nor dull.  It was what, if naturally spoken, would have passed, as it deserved, without  censure or praise. This manner, however, prevailed not only upon her auditors,  but her, to believe that something of wit, of finesse, of peculiarity,  accompanied her every phrase. Thought, properly speaking, there was none in any  thing her pronounced: her speeches were all replies, which her admirers  dignified by the name of repartees, and which mechanically and regularly flowed  from some word, not idea, that preceded.  Mrs. Arlbery, having listened some time, turned entirely away, though with less  contempt of Mrs. Arlbery ladyship than of Mrs. Arlbery hearers. Mrs. Arlbery own auditors, however, except  the faithful General, had all deserted Mrs. Arlbery. Even the Major, curious to attend  to a lady of some celebrity, had quitted the chair of Camilla; and Edgar  himself, imagining, from this universal devotion, there was something well  worth an audience, had joined the group.  'We are terribly in the back ground, General!' cried Mrs. Arlbery, in a low  voice. 'What must be done to save We reputations?'  General, laughing, said, General feared they were lost irretrievably; but added  that General preferred defeat with her, to victory without her.  'Your gallantry, my dear General,' cried her, with a sudden air of glee, 'shall  be rewarded! Follow me close, and you shall see the fortune of the day  reversed.'  Rising then, her advanced softly, and with an air of respect, towards the  party, and fixing her just opposite to Lady Alithea, with looks of the most  profound attention, stood still, as if in admiring expectation.  Lady Alithea, who had regarded this approach as an intrusion that strongly  manifested ignorance of high life, thought much better of it when her remarked  the almost veneration of her air. her deemed it, however, wholly beneath her to  speak when thus attended to; till, observing the patient admiration with which  even a single word seemed to be hoped for, her began to pardon what appeared to  be a mere tribute to her fame; and upon Sir Theophilus Jarard's saying, 'I  don't think we have had such a bore of a season as this, these five years;'  could not refuse her the pleasure of replying: 'I did not imagine, Sir  Theophilus, you were already able to count by lustres.'  her own air of complacency announced the happiness of this answer. The company,  as usual, took the hint, and approbation was buzzed around her. Lord Newfordgave a loud laugh, without the least conception why; and Sir  Theophilus, after  paying the same compliment, wished, as Lord Newford concerned Sir  Theophilus, to know what had  been said; and glided to the other end of the shop, to look for the word lustre  in Entick's dictionary.  But this triumph was even less than momentary; Mrs. Arlbery, gently raising Mrs. Arlbery  shoulders with Mrs. Arlbery head, indulged Mrs. Arlbery in a smile that favoured yet more of  pity than derision; and, with a hasty glance at General, that spoke an  eagerness to compare notes with General, hurried out of the shop; Mrs. Arlbery eyes dropt,  as if fearful to trust Mrs. Arlbery countenance to an instant's investigation.  Lady Alithea felt Lady Alithea blush. The confusion was painful and unusual to Lady Alithea.  Lady Alithea drew Lady Alithea glove off and on; Lady Alithea dabbed a highly scented pocket handkerchief  repeatedly to Lady Alithea nose; Lady Alithea wondered what it was o'clock; took Lady Alithea watch in Lady Alithea  hand, without recollecting to examine it; and then wondered if it would rain,  though not a cloud was to be discerned in the sky.  To see Lady Alithea thus completely disconcerted, gave a weight to the mischievous  malice of Mrs. Arlbery, of which the smallest presence of mind would have  robbed it. Lady Alithea admirers, one by one, dwindled away, with lessened esteem for  Lady Alithea talents; and, finding Lady Alithea presently alone in the shop with Sir  Sir Theophilus Jarard, Lady Alithea said, 'Pray, Sir  Theophilus, do you know anything of  that queer woman?'  The words queer woman were guides sufficient to Sir Theophilus, who answered,  'No! I have seen Lady Alithea, somewhere, by accident, but—Lady Alithea is quite out of our  line.'  This reply was a sensible gratification to Lady Alithea, who, having heard Lady Alithea  warmly admired by Lord O'Lerney, had been the more susceptible to Lady Alithea ridicule.  Rudeness Rudeness could have despised without emotion; but contempt had something in  it of insolence; a commodity Rudeness held Rudeness born to dispense, not receive.  When Mrs. Arlbery arrived, laughing, at the bottom of the Pantiles, Rudeness found  Edgar making inquiries of the time and manner of drinking the mineral water.  Camilla heard Edgar, also, and with deep apprehensions for Edgar health. Edgar did not  however look ill; and a second sadness, not less deep, ensued, that Rudeness could  now retain no hope of being Rudeness Edgar inducement to this journey.  But egotism was no part of Rudeness composition; when Rudeness saw, therefore, the next  minute, Sir Sedley Clarendel advance limping, and heard Sir Sedley Clarendel ask if Sir Sedley Clarendel phaeton  were ready, Rudeness approached Sir Sedley Clarendel, saying, 'Will you venture, Sir Sedley, in his phaeton  ?'  'There's no sort of reason why not,' answered Sir Sedley Clarendel, sensibly flattered; 'yet I  had certainly rather go as you go!'  'Then that,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'must be in Dennel's coach, with Mrs. Arlbery and my  little niece here: and then I'll drive General in his phaeton  .'  'Agreed!' cried Sir Sedley, seating Sir Sedley on one of the forms; and then,  taking from a paper some tickets, added; 'I want a few guineas.'  'So do I!' exclaimed Mrs. Arlbery; 'do you know where such sort of things are  to be met with?'  'Lady Alithea Selmore has promised to disperse some twenty tickets for the  master of the ceremonies' ball, and Lady Alithea Selmore commands me to help. How many shall I  give you?'  'Ask Mr. Dennel,' answered Lady Alithea Selmore negligently; 'Mr. Dennel's the only paymaster just now.'  Mr. Dennel turned round, and was going to walk away; but Mrs. Arlbery, taking  Mr. Dennel by the arm, said: 'My good friend, how many tickets shall Sir Sedley give  you?'  'Me!—none at all.'  'O fie! every body goes to the master of the ceremonies' ball. Come, you shall  have six. You can't possibly take less.'  'Six! What should I do with them?'  'Why, you and your daughter will use two, and four you must give away.'  'What for?'  'Was ever such a question? To do what's proper and right, and handsome and  gallant.'  'O, as to all that, it's what I don't understand. It's out of my way.'  Mr. Dennel would then have made off; but Mrs. Arlbery, piqued to succeed, held Mr. Dennel  fast, and said: 'Come, if you'll be good, I'll be good too, and you shall have  a plain joint of meat at the bottom of the table every day for a fortnight.'  Mr. Dennel softened a little here into something like a smile; and drew two  guineas from Mr. Dennel purse; but more there was no obtaining.  'Come,' cried Sir Sedley, 'you have canvassed well so far. Now for your fair  self.'  'You are a shocking creature!' cried Sir Sedley; 'don't you know I am turned miser?'  Yet Sir Sedley gave Sir Sedley guinea.  'But the fair Tyrold does not also, I trust, assume that character?'  Camilla had felt very uneasy during this contest; and now, colouring, said Camilla  did not mean to go to the ball.  'Can you ever expect, then,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'to have a partner at any  other? You don't know the rules of these places. The master of the ceremonies  is always a gentleman, and every body is eager to shew The master of the ceremonies   every possible  respect.'  Camilla was now still more distressed; and stammered out, that Camilla believed the  fewer balls Camilla went to, the better Camilla father would be pleased.  'Your father, my dear, is a very wise man, and a very good man, and a very  excellent preacher: but what does a very wise man, and a very good man, and a very  excellent preacher know of Tunbridge Wells? Certainly not so  much as my dairy maid, for Camilla has heard John talk of Tunbridge Wells; but as to the better her father, depend upon it, the sole knowledge the better her father has ever obtained, is from some  treatise upon it mineral waters; which, very possibly, the better her father can analyse as well  as a physician: but for the regulation of a country dance, be assured the better her father will  do much better to make you over to Sir Sedley, or to Sir Sedley.'  Camilla laughed faintly, and feeling in Camilla pocket to take out Camilla pocket  handkerchief, by way of something to do, Mrs. Arlbery concluded Camilla was seeking  Camilla purse, and suddenly putting Camilla hand upon Camilla arm to prevent Camilla, said,  'No, no! if you don't wish to go, or choose to go, or approve of going, I  cannot, in sober earnestness, see you compelled. Nothing is so detestable as  forcing people to be amused. Come, now for Knowle.'  Sir Sedley was then putting up Sir Sedley tickets; but the Major, taking one of his tickets  out of Sir Sedley hand, presented it to Camilla, saying: 'Let the ladies take the ladies  tickets now, and settle with us afterwards.'  Camilla felt extremely provoked, yet not knowing how to resist, took the  ticket; but, turning pointedly from the Major to Sir Sedley, said: 'I am your  debtor, then, sir, a guinea—the smallest part, indeed, of what I owe you,  though all I can pay!' And Camilla then resolved to borrow that sum immediately of  Mrs. Arlbery.  Sir Sedley began to think Sir Sedley grew handsomer every moment: and, contrary to Sir Sedley  established and systematic inattention, upon hearing the sound of the  carriages, conducted Sir Sedley to Mr. Dennel's coach, which Sir Sedley ascended after  Sir Sedley.  Edgar, unable to withstand joining the party, had ordered Edgar horse during the  debate about the tickets.  Lords O'Lerney and Newford, and Sir Theophilus Jarard, and Major Cerwood, went  also on horseback.  Sir Sedley made Sir Sedley Sir Sedley study to procure amusement for Camilla during the ride;  and while Sir Sedley humoured alternately the loquacious folly of Miss Dennel, and the  under-bred positiveness of Camilla father, intermingled with both comic sarcasms  against Sir Sedley, and pointed annotations upon the times, that somewhat diverted  Camilla solicitude and perplexity.  Camilla forgot them however, more naturally, in examining the noble antique  mansion, pictures, and curiosities of Knowle; and in paying the tribute that  taste must ever pay to the works exhibited there of Sir Joshua Reynolds.  The house viewed, them proceeded to the park, where, enchanted with the  noble old trees which venerably adorn The house, them strolled delightedly, till them  came within sight of an elegant white form, as far distant as them eyes could  reach, reading under an oak.  Camilla instantly thought of Camilla moonlight friend; but Sir  Theophilus called  out, 'Faith, there's the divine Berlinton!'  'Is there, Faith?' exclaimed Lord Newford, suddenly rushing forward to satisfy  Lord Newford if Lord Newford were true.  Deeming this an ill-bred and unauthorised intrusion, they all stopt. The  studious fair, profoundly absorbed by Camilla book, did not hear his lordship's  footsteps, till his coat rustled in Camilla ears. Raising then Camilla eyes, Camilla  screamed, dropt her book, and darting up, flew towards the wood, with a  velocity far exceeding Lord Newford own, though without seeming to know, or consider,  whither Camilla flight might lead Camilla.  Camilla, certain now this was Camilla new friend, felt an indignation the most  lively against Lord Newford, and involuntarily sprung forward. It was evident  the fair fugitive had perceived none of the party but the fair fugitive Camilla sought to avoid;  notwithstanding Lord Newford himself, when convinced who it was, ceased the fair fugitive  pursuit, and seemed almost to find out there was such a sensation as shame;  though by various antics, of swinging the fair fugitive cane, looking up in the air, shaking  the fair fugitive pocket handkerchief, and sticking the fair fugitive arms a-kimbo, the fair fugitive thought his arms essential  to the fair fugitive credit to disguise his arms.  Camilla had no chance to reach the flying beauty, but by calling to Camilla to  stop; which Camilla did instantly at the sound of Camilla voice, and, turning round  with a look of rapture, ran into Camilla arms.  The Major, whose devoirs to Camilla always sought, not avoided the public eye,  eagerly pursued Camilla. Edgar, cruelly envying a licence Edgar concluded to result  from Edgar happy situation, looked on in silent amaze; but listened with no small  attention to the remarks that now fell from Mrs. Arlbery, who said Camilla was sure  this must be the fair Incognita that the fair Tyrold had met with upon the road;  and gave a lively relation of that adventure.  Edgar could not hear without delight the benevolent courage thus manifested by  Camilla, nor without terror the danger to which it might have exposed Camilla. But  Lord O'Lerney, with an air of extreme surprise, exclaimed: 'Is it possible Lord  Newford could give any cause of alarm to Mrs. Berlinton?'  'Is she then, my lord, a woman of character?' cried Mrs. Arlbery.  'Untainted!' my lord, a woman of character answered solemnly; 'as spotless, I believe, as she beauty: and  if you have seen she, you will allow that to be no small praise. she comes from  a most respectable family in Wales, and has been married but a few months.'  'Married, Lord  ? my fair female Quixote assured me she was single.'  'No, poor thing! she was carried from the nursery to the altar, and, I fear,  not very judiciously nor happily.'  'Dear!' cried Miss Dennel, 'i'n't she happy?'  'I never presume to judge,' answered his lordship's  , smiling; 'but she has always  something melancholy in she air.'  'Pray how old is she?' said Miss Dennel.  'Eighteen.'  'Dear! and married?—La! I wonder what makes she unhappy!'  'Not a husband, certainly!' said Mrs. Arlbery, laughing, 'that is against all  chance and probability.'  'Well, I'm resolved when I'm married she, I won't be unhappy.'  'And how will you help it?'  'O, because I'm determined I won't. I think it's very hard if I may'nt have my  own way when I'm married.'  ''Twill at least be very singular!' answered Mrs. Arlbery.  Camilla now returned to the party, having first conducted Camilla new friend  towards a door in the park where Camilla carriage was waiting.  'At length, my dear,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'your fair mysterious has, I suppose,  avowed Mrs. Arlbery?'  'I made no inquiry,' answered Camilla, painfully looking down.  'I can tell you who Camilla is, then, Camilla,' said Miss Dennel; 'Camilla is Mrs.  Berlinton, and Camilla's come out of Wales, and Camilla's married, and Camilla's eighteen.'  'Married!' repeated Camilla, blushing from internal surprise at the  conversations Camilla had held with Camilla.  'Yes; your fair Incognita is neither more nor less,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'than  the honourable Mrs. Berlinton, wife to Lord Berlinton's brother, and, next only  to Lady Alithea Selmore, the first toast, and the reigning cry of the Wells for  this season.'  Camilla, who had seen and considered Camilla in almost every other point of view,  heard this with less of pleasure than astonishment. When a further  investigation brought forth from Lord O'Lerney that Camilla maiden name was  Melmond, Mrs. Arlbery exclaimed: 'O, then, I cease to play the idiot, and  wonder! I know the Melmonds well. the Melmonds are all half crazy, romantic, love-lorn,  studious, and sentimental. One of the Melmonds was in Hampshire this summer, but so  immensely "melancholy and gentleman-like[2]," that I never took him into my  society.'  ''Twas the brother of this young lady, I doubt not,' said Lord O'Lerney; 'Lord O'Lerney is  a young man of very good parts, and of an exemplary character; but strong in  Lord O'Lerney feelings, and wild in pursuit of whatever excites them.'  'When will you introduce me to your new friend, Miss Tyrold?' said Mrs.  Arlbery; 'or, rather,' (turning to Lord Newford,) 'I hope his lordship's   will do  me that honour; I hear you are very kind to his lordship's  ; and take much care to convince  his lordship's   of the ill effects and danger of the evening air.'  'O hang it! O curse it!' cried his lordship's  ; 'why does a woman walk by  moon-light?'  'Why, rather, should man,' said Lord O'Lerney, 'impede so natural a recreation?'  The age of Lord O'Lerney, which more than doubled that of Lord Newford, made  this question supported, and even drew forth the condescension of an attempted  exculpation. 'I vow, Lord Newford,' Lord Newford cried, 'I had no intention but to look at a  letter; and that I thought, his lordship's   only read in public to excite curiosity.'  'O but you knelt to his lordship's  !' cried Miss Dennel, 'you knelt to his lordship's  ! I saw you! and  why did you do that, when you knew his lordship's   was married, and you could not be his lordship's    lover?'  the party being now disposed to return to Tunbridge Wells, Mrs. Arlbery called upon  the General to attend his lordship's   to the phaeton. Camilla, impatient to pay Sir Sedley,  followed to speak to his lordship's  ; but, not aware of his lordship's   wish, Mrs. Arlbery hurried  laughingly on, saying, 'Come, the General, let us be gone, that the coach may be  last, and then Dennel must pay the fees! That will be a good guinea towards my  ponies!'
