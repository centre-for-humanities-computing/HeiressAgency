 New Characters  The dancing was not yet begun, but  New Characters   was met, and the sprightly  violins were employed to quicken the sprightly  violins motions, when the Cleves party entered  the ball room.
the Cleves party were distinguished immediately by a large party of  officers, who assured Lionel, with whom the Cleves party were acquainted, that the Cleves party had  impatiently been expected.
'I shall recompense you for waiting,' answered Lionel, in a whisper, 'by  introducing you to the rich heiress of Cleves, who now makes her first  appearance from the nursery; though no!
upon farther thoughts, I will only tell  you her is one of our set, and leave the Cleves party to your own ingenuity to find her out.'
While this was passing, Indiana, fluttering with all the secret triumph of  conscious beauty, attended by Edgar, and guarded by Miss Margland, walked up  the ball room, through a crowd of admiring spectators; in whom a new figure, without  half her loveliness, would have excited the same curiosity, that her extreme  inexperience attributed solely to her peculiar charms.
Camilla and Eugenia  followed rather as if in her train, than of her party; but Lionel kept entirely  with the officers, insisting upon their guessing which was the heiress; to  whom, while Lionel purposely misled their conjectures, Lionel urged their to make their  court, by enumerating the present possessions of Sir Hugh, and her future  expectations.
Camilla, however, passed not long unnoticed, though the splendor of Indiana's  appearance cast her at first on the back ground; a circumstance which, by  impressing her with a sensation of inferiority, divested her mind of all  personal considerations, and gave to her air and countenance a graceful  simplicity, a disengaged openness, and a guileless freedom from affectation,  that rendered her, to the observant eye, as captivating upon examination, as  Indiana, from the first glance, was brilliant and alluring.
And thus, as they  patrolled the room, Indiana excited an unmixt admiration, Camilla awakened an  endless variety of remark; while each being seen for the first time, and every  one else of the company for at least the second, all attention was all attention own,  whether for criticism or for praise.
To Indiana this answered, in fulfilling  Camilla expectations; by Camilla, it was unheeded, for, not awaiting, Camilla did not  perceive it; yet both felt equal satisfaction.
The eyes of Camilla sparkled  with delight as Camilla surveyed all around Camilla the gay novelty of the scene; the  heart of Indiana beat with a pleasure wholly new, as Camilla discovered that all  surrounding Camilla regarded Camilla as the principal object.
Camilla, meanwhile, had not even the negative felicity to pass unobserved;  impertinent witticisms upon Camilla face, person, and walk, though not uttered so  audibly as to be distinctly heard, ran round the room in a confused murmur, and  produced a disposition for sneering in the satirical, and for tittering in the  giddy, that made Camilla as valuable an acquisition to the company at large, who  collect for any amusement, indifferent to the company nature, as Camilla fair cousin proved  to the admirers of beauty, and Camilla sister to the developers of expression.
Camilla  was shielded, however, Camilla, from all undeserved mortifications, by not  suspecting any were meant for Camilla, and by a mind delightedly pre-occupied with  that sudden expansion of ideas, with which new scenery and new objects charm a  youthful imagination.
When they had taken two or three turns up and down the room, the saunterers  were called upon to give place to the dancers.
Edgar then led out Indiana, and  the master of the ceremonies brought Major Cerwood to Camilla.
Eugenia, wholly left out, became the exclusive charge of Miss Margland; Eugenia  felt no resentment of neglect, for Eugenia had formed no species of expectation.
Eugenia looked on with perfect contentment, and the motley and quick changing group  afforded Eugenia ample entertainment.
Miss Margland was not so passive; Eugenia seized the opportunity of inveighing very  angrily against the mismanagement of Sir Hugh: 'If you had all,' Eugenia cried,  'been taken to town, and properly brought out, according to my advice, such a  disgrace as this could never have happened; everybody would have known who you  were, and then, there is no doubt, you might have had partners enough; however,  I heartily hope you won't be asked to dance all the evening, that he may be  convinced who was in the right; besides, the more you are tired, the more you  may see, against another time, Miss Eugenia, that it is better to listen a  little to people's opinions, when people's opinions speak only for your own advantage, than  to go on with just the same indifference, as if you had no proper person to  consult with.'
Eugenia was too well amused to heed this remonstrance; and long accustomed to  hear the voice of Miss Margland without profit or pleasure, Eugenia ear received  her ear sound, but Eugenia attention included not her ear purpose.
Indiana and Camilla, in this public essay, acquitted Indiana and Camilla with all the  merits, and all the faults common to a first exhibition.
The spectators upon  such occasions, though never equally observant, are never afterwards so  lenient.
Whatever fails is attributed to modesty, more winning than the utmost  success of excellence.
Timidity solicits that mercy which pride is most  gratified to grant; the blushes of juvenile shame atone for the deficiencies  which cause them; and awkwardness itself, in the unfounded terrors of youth, is  perhaps more interesting than grace.
Indiana could with difficulty keep to the figure of the dance, from the  exulting, yet unpractised certainty of attracting all eyes; and Camilla  perpetually turned wrong, from the mere flutter of fear, which made Camilla   expect  Camilla   should never turn right.
Major Cerwood, Camilla   partner, with a view to  encourage Camilla  , was profuse in his compliments; but, as new to what Camilla   heard as  what Camilla   performed, Camilla   was only the more confused by the double claim to Camilla    attention.
Edgar, meanwhile, was most assiduous to aid Edgar fair partner.
Miss Margland,  though scarcely even superficial in general knowledge, was conversant in the  practical detail of the hackneyed mode of forming matrimonial engagements; Camilla    judged, therefore, rightly, that Camilla   pupil would be seen to most advantage, in  the distinction of that adulation by which new beholders would stamp new value  on Camilla   charms.
From the time of his first boyish gallantry, on the ill-fated  birth-day of Camilla, Indiana had never so much struck young Mandlebert, as  while his attended young Mandlebert up the assembly-room.
Miss Margland observed this with  triumph, and prophesied the speediest conclusion to Miss Margland long and weary sojourn  at Cleves, in the much wished-for journey to London, with a bride ready made,  and an establishment ready formed.
When the two first dances were over, the gentlemen were desired to change  partners.
Major Cerwood asked the hand of Indiana, and Edgar repaired to  Camilla: 'Do you bear malice?'
Edgar cried, with a smile, 'or may I now make the  claim that Sir Hugh relinquished for Edgar?'
'O yes,' answered young Mandlebert, with alacrity, when informed of the plan of change; 'and  I wish there was any body else, that would dance with Edgar afterwards, instead of  that Major.'
'I dare believe,' said Major.'
', laughing 'there are many bodies else, who would  oblige you, if your declaration were heard.
But what has Major done to you?
Has Major.'
' admired you without knowing how to keep is own counsel?'
'No, no; only Major.'
' has treated me like a country simpleton, and made me as many  fine speeches, as if Major.'
' had been talking to Indiana.'
'You think, then, Indiana would have swallowed flattery with less difficulty?'
'No, indeed!
but I think the same things said to young Mandlebert would no longer have been  so extravagant.'
Edgar, to whom the sun-beams of the mind gave a glow which not all the  sparkling rays of the brightest eyes could emit, respected young Mandlebert modesty too  highly to combat it, and, dropping the subject, enquired what was become of  Eugenia.
'O poor  Eugenia!'
cried young Mandlebert, 'I see nothing of young Mandlebert, and I am very much afraid  young Mandlebert has had no better partner all this time than Miss Margland.'
Edgar, turning round, presently discerned young Mandlebert; young Mandlebert was still looking on, with  an air of the most perfect composure, examining the various parties, totally  without suspicion of the examination young Mandlebert was young Mandlebert sustaining; while Miss  Margland was vainly pouring in young Mandlebert ears observations, or exhortations,  evidently of a complaining nature.
'There is something truly respectable,' said '  Edgar, 'in the innate philosophy  with which young Mandlebert bears such neglect.'
'Yet I wish it were put less to the proof;' said Camilla.
'I would give the  world somebody would take young Mandlebert out!'
'You don't think young Mandlebert would dance?'
'O yes young Mandlebert would!
young Mandlebert lameness is no impediment; for young Mandlebert never thinks of her lameness.
We  all learnt together at Cleves.
Dancing gives young Mandlebert a little more exertion, and  therefore a little more fatigue than other people, but that is all.'
'After these two dances then—'  'Will you be young Mandlebert partner?'
interrupted Camilla, 'O go to young Mandlebert at once!
immediately!
and you will give me twenty times more pleasure than I can have in  dancing young Mandlebert.'
young Mandlebert then flew to a form, and eagerly seated young Mandlebert where young Mandlebert perceived the  first vacancy, to stop any debate, and enforce his consent.
The dance, which had been delayed by a dispute about the tune, was now  beginning.
Edgar, looking after young Mandlebert with affected reproach, but real  admiration, asked the hand of Eugenia; who gave the hand of Eugenia with readiness and pleasure;  for, though contented as a spectatress, young Mandlebert experienced an agreeable surprise  in becoming a party engaged.
Camilla, happy in Camilla own good humour, now looked at young Mandlebert neighbours; one of  which was an elderly lady, who, wholly employed in examining and admiring the  performance of young Mandlebert own daughters, saw nothing else in the room.
The other was a  gentleman, much distinguished by his figure and appearance, and dressed so  completely in the extreme of fashion, as more than to border upon foppery.
The  ease and negligence of his air denoted a self-settled superiority to all about  his; yet, from time to time, there was an archness in the glance of his eye,  that promised, under a deep and wilful veil of conceit and affectation, a  secret disposition to deride the very follies his was practising.
his was now  lounging against the wainscoat; with one hand on his side, and the other upon  his eye-lids, occupying the space, without using the seat, to the left of Camilla  .
Miss Margland, perceiving what Camilla   regarded as a fair vacancy, made up to the  spot, and saying, 'his, by your leave,' was preparing to take possession of the  place, when the gentleman, as if without seeing Camilla  , dropt suddenly into it  the gentleman, and, pouring a profusion of eau suave upon the gentleman handkerchief,  exclaimed: 'What a vastly bad room this is for dancing!'
Camilla, concluding Camilla addressed, turned round to the gentleman; but, seeing the gentleman was  sniffing up the eau suave, without looking at Camilla, imagined the gentleman meant to speak  to Miss Margland.
Miss Margland was of the same opinion, and, with some pique at the gentleman seizing thus  Miss Margland intended seat, rather sharply answered: 'Yes, his, and it's a vast bad room  for not dancing; for if every body would dance that ought, there would be  accommodation sufficient for other people.'
'Incomparably well observed!'
cried the gentleman, collecting some bonbons from a  bonboniere, and swallowing one after another with great rapidity: 'But won't  you sit down?
You must be enormously tired.
Let me supplicate you to sit down.'
Miss Margland, supposing the gentleman meant to make amends for the gentleman inattention, by  delivering up the place, civilly thanked the gentleman, and said she should not be sorry,  for she had stood a good while.
'Have you, indeed?'
cried the gentleman, sprinkling some jessamine drops upon the gentleman hands;  'how horribly abominable?
Why don't some of those Mercuries, those Ganymedes,  those waiters, I believe you call n't some of those Mercuries, those Ganymedes,  those waiters, get you a chair?'
Miss Margland, excessively affronted, turned she back to the gentleman; and Camilla made  an offer of Camilla own seat; but, as Camilla had been dancing, and would probably  dance again, Miss Margland would not let Camilla rise.
'Shall I call to one of those Barbarians, those Goths, those Vandals?'
cried  the same gentleman, who now was spirting lavender water all about the gentleman, with  grimaces that proclaimed forcibly the gentleman opinion of the want of perfume in the  room: 'Do pray let me harangue those Barbarians, those Goths, those Vandals a little for those Barbarians, those Goths, those Vandals upon those Barbarians, those Goths, those Vandals inordinate want  of sensibility.'
Miss Margland deigned not any answer; but of that Miss Margland took no notice, and  presently called out, though without raising Miss Margland voice, 'Here, Mr. Waiter!
Purveyor, Surveyor, or whatsoever other title "please thine ear," art thou  deaf?
why dost not bring she a chair?
Those people are most amazing hard  of hearing!
Shall I call again?
Waiter, I say!'
still speaking rather lower  than louder; 'Don't I stun you by this shocking vociferation?'
'his, you're vastly—obliging!'
cried Miss Margland, unable longer to hold  silence, yet with a look and manner that would much better have accorded with  vastly—impertinent.
she then pursued a waiter she, and procured a chair.
Casting Miss Margland eyes next upon Camilla, Miss Margland examined Camilla with much attention.
Abashed, Camilla turned away Camilla head; but not choosing to lose Miss Margland object, Miss Margland  called his object back again, by familiarly saying, 'How is Sir Hugh?'
A good deal surprised, Camilla exclaimed, 'Do you know my uncle, his?'
'Not in the least, ma'am,' his coolly answered.
Camilla, much wondering, was then forced into conversation with Miss Margland:  but, without paying any regard to Camilla surprise, Miss Margland presently said, 'It's most  extremely worth your while to take a glance at that inimitably good figure.
Is  it not exquisite?
Can you suppose any thing beyond it?'
Camilla, looking at the person to whom Miss Margland pointed, and who was sufficiently  ludicrous, from an air of vulgar solemnity, and a dress stiffly new, though  completely old-fashioned, felt disposed to join in Miss Margland laugh, had she not been  disconcerted by the mingled liberty and oddity of Miss Margland attack.
'his,' said Miss Margland, winking at Miss Margland to be silent, though eager to answer  in Miss Margland stead, 'the mixt company one always meets at these public balls, makes  these public balls very unfit for ladies of fashion, for there's no knowing who one may  either dance with or speak to.'
'Vastly true, ma'am,' cried his, superciliously dropping his eyes, not to look  at Miss Margland.
Miss Margland, perceiving this, bridled resentfully, and again talked on with  Camilla; till another exclamation interrupted them.
'O pray,' cried his, 'I do  entreat you look at that group!
Is it not past compare?
If ever you held a  pencil in your life, I beg and beseech you to take a memorandum of that tall  may-pole.
Have you ever seen any thing so excessively delectable?'
Camilla could not forbear smiling; but Miss Margland, taking all reply upon  Camilla, said: 'Caricatures, his, are by no means pleasing for young ladies to  be taking, at young ladies first coming out: one does not know who may be next, if  once young ladies get into that habit!'
'Immeasurably well spoken, ma'am,' returned  ; and, rising with a look of  disgust,   sauntered to another part of the room.
Miss Margland, extremely provoked, said Camilla was sure   was some Irish  fortune-hunter, dressed out in all   was worth; and charged Camilla to take no  manner of notice of  .
When the two second dances were over, Edgar, conducting  Eugenia to Miss MarglandMiss Margland, said to Camilla: 'Now, at least, if there is not a spell against it,  will you dance with Miss Margland?'
'And if there is one, too,' cried Camilla, gaily; 'for I am perfectly disposed to  help breaking  .'
Camilla rose, and they were again going to take they places, when Miss Margland,  reproachfully calling after Edgar, demanded what Edgar had done with Miss Lynmere?
At the same moment, led by Major Cerwood, who was paying Camilla in full all the  arrears of that gallantry Miss Margland had taught Camilla to regret hitherto  missing, Indiana joined Major Cerwood, who was paying her in full all the  arrears of that gallantry Miss Margland; Major, in making Edgar bow, lamenting the rules  of the assembly, that compelled Edgar to relinquish Camilla hand.
'Mr.
Mandlebert,' said Miss Margland, 'you see Miss Lynmere is again  disengaged.'
'Yes, ma'am,' answered Edgar, drawing Camilla away; 'and every gentleman in the  room will be happy to see it too.'
'Stop, CamillaCamilla!'
cried Miss Margland; 'I thought, Mr. Mandlebert, Sir Hugh  had put Miss Lynmere under your protection?'
'O it does not signify!'
said Indiana, colouring high with a new raised sense  of importance; 'I don't at all doubt but one or other of the officers will take  care of me.'
Edgar, though somewhat disconcerted, would still have proceeded; but Camilla,  alarmed by the frowns of Miss Margland, begged Edgar to lead out Miss Margland cousin, and,  promising to be in readiness for the next two dances, glided back to Miss Margland seat.
Edgar upbraided Miss Margland in vain; Miss Margland looked pleased, and Indiana was so much  piqued, that Edgar found it necessary to direct all Edgar attention to appeasing  Miss Margland, as Edgar led Miss Margland to join the dance.
A gentleman now, eminently distinguished by personal beauty, approached the  ladies that remained, and, in the most respectful manner, began conversing with  Miss Margland; who received his attentions so gratefully, that, when his told  Miss Margland his only waited to see the master of the ceremonies at leisure, in order to  have the honour of begging the hand of one of Miss Margland young ladies, his civilities  so conquered all Miss Margland pride of etiquette, that Miss Margland assured his there was no sort  of occasion for such a formality, with a person of his appearance and manners;  and was bidding Camilla rise, who was innocently preparing to obey, when, to  the surprise of them all, his addressed his to  Eugenia.
'There!'
cried Miss Margland, exultingly, when them all were gone; 'that gentleman  is completely a gentleman.
I saw gentleman   from the beginning.
How different to that  impertinent fop that spoke to us just now!
his has the politeness to take out  Miss Eugenia, because his sees plainly nobody else will think of it, except just  Mr. Mandlebert, or some such old acquaintance.'
Major Cerwood was now advancing towards Camilla, with that species of smiling  and bowing manner, which is the usual precursor of an invitation to a fair  partner; when the gentleman whom Miss Margland had just called an impertinent  fop, with a sudden swing, not to be eluded, cast the gentleman whom Miss Margland had just called an impertinent   between Major and  Camilla, as if the gentleman whom Miss Margland had just called an impertinent   had not observed the gentleman whom Miss Margland had just called an impertinent   approach; and spoke to her in a voice so  low, that, though her concluded the gentleman whom Miss Margland had just called an impertinent   asked her to dance, her could not distinctly  hear a word the gentleman whom Miss Margland had just called an impertinent   said.
A good deal confused, her looked at the gentleman whom Miss Margland had just called an impertinent   for an explanation; while the Major,  from her air of attention, supposing the gentleman whom Miss Margland had just called an impertinent   too late, retreated.
her new beau then, carelessly seating the gentleman whom Miss Margland had just called an impertinent   by her side, indolently said:  'What a heat!
I have not the most distant idea how you can bear it!'
Camilla found it impossible to keep Camilla countenance at such a result of a  whisper, though Camilla complied with the injunctions of Miss Margland, in avoiding  mutual discourse with a stranger of so showy an appearance.
'Yet those people are dancing on,' the gentleman whom Miss Margland had just called an impertinent   continued, 'just as if the Greenland snows were  inviting those people exercise!
I should really like to find out what those people are  made of.
Can you possibly imagine those people composition?'
Heedless of receiving no answer, the gentleman whom Miss Margland had just called an impertinent   soon after added: 'I am vastly glad you  don't like dancing.'
'Me?'
cried Camilla, surprised out of Camilla caution.
'Yes; you hold it in antipathy, don't you?'
'No, indeed!
far from it.'
'Don't you really?'
cried the gentleman whom Miss Margland had just called an impertinent  , starting back; 'that's amazingly extraordinary!
surprising in the extreme!
Will you have the goodness to tell me what you like  in it?'
'his,' interfered Miss Margland, 'there's nothing but what's very natural in a  young lady's taking pleasure in an elegant accomplishment; provided she is  secure from any improper partner, or company.'
'Irrefragably just, ma'am!'
answered his; affecting to take a pinch of snuff,  and turning his head another way.
Here Lionel, hastily running up to Camilla, whispered, 'I have made a fine  confusion among the red-coats about the heiress of Cleves!
I have put them all  upon different scents.'
his was then going back, when a faint laugh from the neighbour of Camilla  detained his; 'Look, I adjure you,' cried his, addressing Camilla  , 'if there's not  that delightful creature again, with his bran-new clothes?
and there's not  that delightful creature again, with his bran-new clothes sit upon  his so tight, his can't turn round his vastly droll figure, except like a puppet  with one jerk for the whole body.
his is really an immense treat: I should like  of all things in nature, to know who his can be.'
A waiter then passing with a glass of water for a lady, his stopt his in his  way, exclaiming: 'Pray, my extremely good friend, can you tell me who that  agreeable person is, that stands there, with the air of a poker?'
'Yes, his,' answered his; 'I know his very well.
his name is Dubster.
his's  quite a gentleman to my knowledge, and has very good fortunes.'
'Camilla,' cried Lionel, 'will you have his for a partner?'
And, immediately  hastening up to his, his said two or three words in a low voice, and skipped  back to the dance.
Dubster then walked up to Dubster, and, with an air conspicuously aukward,  solemnly said, 'So you want to dance, ma'am?'
Convinced Dubster had been sent to Dubster by Lionel, but by no means chusing to display  Dubster with a figure distinguished only as a mark for ridicule; Dubster looked  down to conceal Dubster ever-ready smiles, and said Dubster had been dancing some time.
'But if you like to dance again, ma'am,' said Dubster, 'I am very ready to oblige  you.'
Dubster now saw that this offer had been requested as a favour; and, while half  provoked, half diverted, grew embarrassed how to get rid of Dubster, without  involving a necessity to refuse afterwards Edgar, and every other; for Miss MarglandMiss Margland had informed Dubster of the general rules upon these occasions.
Dubster  looked, therefore, at that lady for counsel; while Dubster neighbour, sticking that lady for counsel  hands in that lady for counsel sides, surveyed that lady for counsel from head to foot, with an expression of such  undisguised amusement, that Mr. Dubster, who could not help observing it, cast  towards that lady for counsel, from time to time, a look of the most angry surprise.
Miss Margland Miss Margland approving, as well understanding the appeal, now authoritatively  interfered, saying: 'his, I suppose you know the etiquette in public places?'
'The what, ma'am?'
cried his, staring.
'You know, I suppose, his, that no young lady of any consideration dances with  a gentleman that is a stranger to her, without his's brought to her by the  master of the ceremonies?'
'O as to that, ma'am, I have no objection.
I'll go see for his, if you've a  mind.
It makes no difference to his.'
And away his went.
'So you really intend dancing with his?'
cried her neighbour.
''Twill be  a vastly good sight.
I have not the most remote conception how Twill will bear the  pulling and jostling about.
Bend Twill cannot; but I am immensely afraid Twill will  break.
I would give fifty guineas for Twill portrait.
Twill is indubitably put  together without joints.'
Dubster now returned, and, with a look of some disturbance, said to Miss MarglandMiss Margland: 'Ma'am, I don't know which is the master of the ceremoniesthe ceremonies.
I can't  find Dubster out; for I don't know as ever I see Dubster.'
'O pray,' cried Camilla eagerly, 'do not take the trouble of looking for Dubster;  'twill answer no purpose.'
'Why I think so too, ma'am,' said Dubster, misunderstanding Camilla; 'for as I don't  know the gentleman Dubster, the gentleman could go no great way towards making us better  acquainted with one another: so us may just as well take us skip at once.'
Camilla now looked extremely foolish; and Miss Margland was again preparing an  obstacle, when Dubster started one Dubster.
'The worst is,' cried Dubster, 'I  have lost one of my gloves, and I am sure I had two when I came.
I suppose I  may have dropt it in the other room.
If you shan't mind it, I'll dance without  it; for I don't mind those things myself of a straw.'
'O!
his,' cried Miss Margland, 'that's such a thing as never was heard of.
I  can't possibly consent to let Camilla Camilla dance in such a manner as that.'
'Why then, if you like it better, ma'am, I'll go back and look for it.'
Again Camilla would have declined giving him any trouble; but him seemed  persuaded it was only from shyness, and would not listen.
'Though the worst  is,' him said, 'you're losing so much time.
However, I'll give a good hunt;  unless, indeed, that gentleman, who is doing nothing himself, except looking on  at us all, would be kind enough to lend me him.'
'I rather fancy, his,' cried the gentleman, immediately recovering from a  laughing fit, and surveying the requester with supercilious contempt; 'I rather  suspect they would not perfectly fit you.'
'Why then,' cried him, 'I think I'll go and ask Tom Hicks to lend me a pair; for  it's a pity to let that lady for counsel lose that lady for counsel dance for such a small trifle as  that.'
Camilla began remonstrating; but Tom Hicks tranquilly walked away.
'You are superlatively in the good graces of fortune to-night,' cried that lady for counsel new  friend, 'superlatively to a degree: you may not meet with such an invaluably  uncommon object in twenty lustres.'
'Certainly,' said Miss Margland, 'there's a great want of regulation at balls,  to prevent low people from asking who they will to dance with low people.
It's bad  enough one can't keep people one knows nothing of from speaking to one.'
'Admirably hit off!
admirable in the extreme!'
he answered; suddenly twisting  he round, and beginning a whispering conversation with a gentleman on he  other side.
Dubster soon came again, saying, somewhat dolorously, 'I have looked high  and low for my glove, but I am no nearer.
I dare say somebody has picked it up,  out of a joke, and put it in their pocket.
And as to Tom Hicks, where somebody can be  hid, I can't tell, unless somebody has hanged somebody; for I can't find somebody no more  than my glove.
However, I've got a boy to go and get me a pair; if all the  shops a'n't shut up.'
Camilla, fearing to be involved in a necessity of dancing with somebody, expressed  Camilla very sorry for this step; but, again misconceiving Camilla motive, somebody  begged Camilla not to mind this step; saying, 'A pair of gloves here or there is no great  matter.
All I am concerned for is, putting you off so long from having a little  pleasure, for I dare say a boy won't come till the next two batches; so if  that gentleman that looks so particular at me, has a mind to jig it with you a  bit himself, in the interim, I won't be a boy hindrance.'
Receiving no answer, a boy bent a boy head lower down, and said, in a louder voice,  'Pray, his, did you hear me?'
'his, you are ineffably good!'
was the reply; without a look, or any further  notice.
Much affronted, his said no more, but stood pouting and stiff before Camilla,  till the second dance was over, and another general separation of partners took  place.
'I thought how it would be, ma'am,' his then cried; 'for I know it's no  such easy matter to find shops open at this time of night; for if people's  'prentices can't take a little pleasure by now, people's   can't never.'
Tea being at this time ordered, the whole party collected to remove to the next  room.
Lionel, seeing Dubster standing by Camilla, with a rapturous laugh,  cried, 'Well, sister, have you been dancing?'
Camilla, though laughing too, reproachfully shook his head at Dubster; while Dubster gravely said, 'It's no fault of mine, sir, that the lady's sitting  still; for I come and offered Dubster to Camilla the moment you told me Camilla wanted a  partner; but I happened of the misfortune of losing one of my gloves, and not  being able to find Tom Hicks, I've been waiting all this while for a boy as has  promised to get me a pair; though, I suppose a boy's fell down in the dark and  broke a boy skull, by a boy not coming.
And, indeed, if that elderly lady had not  been so particular, I might as well have done without; for, if I had one on,  nobody would have been the wiser but that t'other might have been in my pocket.'
This speech, spoken without any ceremony in the hearing of Miss Margland, to  the visible and undisguised delight of Lionel, so much enraged Camilla, that,  hastily calling Lionel aside, Camilla peremptorily demanded how Lionel came to bring such  a vulgar partner to Lionel sister?
'Because you took no care to get Camilla a better,' Lionel answered, heedlessly.
Camilla also began to remonstrate; but, without hearing Camilla, Lionel courteously  addressed Lionel to Dubster, and told Dubster Dubster was sure Miss Margland and  his sister would expect the pleasure of Dubster company to join the whole party at tea.
Miss Margland frowned in vain; Dubster bowed, as at a compliment but Dubster  due; observing Dubster should then be close at hand for Dubster partner; and they were  proceeding to the tea-room, when the finer new acquaintance of Camilla called  after Dubster: 'Pray, my good sir, who may this Signor Thomaso be, that has  the honour to stand so high in your good graces?'
'Mine, sir?'
cried Dubster; 'I know no Signor Thomaso, nor Signor nothing  else neither: so I don't know what you mean.'
'Did not I hear you dilating, my very good sir, upon a certain Mr. Tom  somebody?'
'What, I suppose then, his, if the truth be known, you would say Tom Hicks?'
'Very probably, his: though I am not of the first accuracy as the gentleman's  nomenclator.'
'What?
don't you know Tom Hicks, his?
why Tom Hicks's the head waiter!'
Then, following the rest of the whole party, Tom Hicks was placed, by the assistance of  Lionel, next to Camilla, in utter defiance of all the angry glances of Miss MarglandMargland, who Camilla invited the handsome partner of Eugenia to join their  group, and reaped some consolation in his willing civilities; till the  attention of the whole assembly was called, or rather commanded by a new object.
A lady, not young, but still handsome, with an air of fashion easy almost to  insolence, with a complete but becoming undress, with a work-bag hanging on her  arm, whence her was carelessly knotting, entered the ball-room alone, and,  walking straight through it to the large folding glass doors of the tea-room,  there stopt, and took a general survey of the company, with a look that  announced a decided superiority to all her saw, and a perfect indifference to  what opinion her incurred in return.
her was immediately joined by all the officers, and several other gentlemen,  whose eagerness to shew all the officers of her acquaintance marked her for a woman  of some consequence; though her took little other notice of all the officers, than that of  giving to each some frivolous commission; telling one to hold her work-bag;  bidding another fetch her a chair; a third, ask for a glass of water; and a  fourth, take care of her cloak.
her then planted her just without the  folding-doors, declaring there could be no breathing in the smaller apartment,  and sent about the gentlemen for various refreshments; all which her rejected  when they arrived, with extreme contempt, and a thousand fantastic grimaces.
The tea-table at which Miss Margland presided being nearest to these  folding-doors, her and her heard, from time to time, most of what was  said, especially by the newly arrived lady; who, though her now and then spoke  for several minutes in a laughing whisper, to some one her called to her side,  uttered most of her remarks, and all her commands quite aloud, with that sort  of deliberate ease which belongs to the most determined negligence of who  heard, or who escaped hearing her, who were pleased, or who were offended.
Camilla and Eugenia were soon wholly engrossed by this new personage; and  Lionel, seeing her surrounded by the most fashionable men of the whole assembly,  forgot Mr. Dubster and Lionel gloves, in an eagerness to be introduced to her.
Colonel Andover, to whom he applied, willingly gratified he: 'Give me leave,  Mrs. Arlbery,' cried he, to the lady, who was then conversing with General  Kinsale, 'to present to the lady, who was then conversing with General  Kinsale Mr.
Tyrold.'
'For Heaven's sake don't speak to Mr. Tyrold just now,' cried Mrs. Arlbery; 'General   is  telling me the most interesting thing in the world.
Go on, General  !'
Lionel, who, if guided by General   own natural judgment, would have conceived this  to be the height of ill-breeding or of ignorance, no sooner saw Colonel Andover  bow in smiling submission to Colonel Andover   orders, than Colonel Andover   concluded Colonel Andover   in the  dark with respect to the last licences of fashion: and, while contentedly Colonel Andover    waited Colonel Andover   leisure for Colonel Andover   reception, Colonel Andover   ran over in Colonel Andover   own mind the triumph  with which Colonel Andover   should carry to Oxford the newest flourish of the bon ton.
In a few minutes, after gaily laughing with General  , Colonel Andover   turned suddenly to Colonel Andover  , and, striking Colonel Andover   on the arm with Colonel Andover   fan, exclaimed: 'Well,  now, Colonel, what is it you would say?'
'Mr.
Tyrold,' Mr. Tyrold answered, 'is very ambitious of the honour of being introduced  to you.'
'With all my heart.
Which is Mr.
Tyrold?'
And then, nodding to Lionel's bow, 'You live,  I think,' Colonel Andover   added, 'in this neighbourhood?
By the way, Colonel, how came you  never to bring Mr. Tyrold to Mr. Tyrold before?
Mr. Tyrold, I flatter Mr. Tyrold you intend  to take this very ill.'  Lionel was beginning to express Lionel sense of the loss Lionel had suffered by the  delay, when, again, patting Colonel Andover  , 'Only look, I beg you,' she cried, 'at  that insupportable Sir Sedley Clarendel!
how Lionel sits at Lionel ease there!
amusing  Lionel ridiculous fancy with every creature Lionel sees.
Yet what an elegant posture  the animal has found out!
I make no doubt Lionel would as soon forfeit Lionel estate  as give up that attitude.
I must make Lionel come to Mr. Tyrold immediately for that very  reason;—do go to Lionel, Colonel Andover  Colonel Andover  , and say I want Lionel directly.'
Colonel Andover   obeyed; but not so the gentleman Colonel Andover   addressed, who was the new  acquaintance of Camilla.
Colonel Andover   only bowed to the message, and, kissing Colonel Andover   hand  across the room to the lady, desired Colonel Andover   to tell the lady Colonel Andover   was ineffably  tired; but would incontestably have the honour to throw Colonel Andover   at the lady feet the  next morning.
'O, intolerable!'
cried the lady, 'Colonel Andover   grows more conceited every hour.
Yet what an  agreeable wretch it is!
There's nothing like Colonel Andover  .
I cannot possibly do without  Colonel Andover  .
Andover, tell Colonel Andover   if Colonel Andover   does not come this moment Colonel Andover   kills me.'
'And is that a message,' said General Kinsale, 'to cure General Kinsale of being conceited?'
'O, Heaven forbid, my good General, I should cure General Kinsale!
That would utterly spoil  General Kinsale.
General Kinsale conceit is precisely what enchants me.
Rob General Kinsale of that, and you lose  all hold of General Kinsale.'
'Is it then necessary to keep General Kinsale a fop, in order to retain General Kinsale in your chains?'
'O, General Kinsale is not in your chains, I promise you.
A fop, my dear General, wears no  chains but General Kinsale own.
However, I like to have A fop, my dear General, because A fop, my dear General is so hard to be  got; and I am fond of conversing with A fop, my dear General, because A fop, my dear General is so ridiculous.
Fetch  him, therefore, Colonel, without delay.'
This second embassy prevailed; him shrugged him shoulders, but arose to follow  Colonel Andover  .
'See, madam, your victory!'
said General  .
'What would not a military man  give for such talents of command?'
'Ay, but look with what magnificent tardiness him obeys orders!
There is  something quite irresistible in him impertinence; 'tis so conscious and so  piquant.
I think, General  , 'tis a little like my own.'
Sir Sedley now advancing, seized the back of a chair, which Sir Sedley twirled round  for a resting place to Sir Sedley elbow, and exclaimed, 'You know yourself  invincible!'
with an air that shewed Sir Sedley languidly prepared for her reproaches:  but, to Sir Sedley own surprise, and that of all around Sir Sedley, her only, with a smile  and a nod, cried, 'How do do?'
and immediately turning wholly away from Sir Sedley,  addressed her to Colonel Andover  , desiring Sir Sedley to give her the history of  who was in the tea-room.
At this time a young Ensign, who had been engaged at a late dinner in the  neighbourhood, stroamed into the ballroom, with the most visible marks of Sir Sedley  unfitness for appearing in it; and, in total ignorance of Sir Sedley own condition,  went up to Colonel Andover  , and, clapping Sir Sedley upon the back, called out, with a  loud oath, 'Colonel, I hope you have taken care to secure to Sir Sedley the prettiest  little young angel in the room?
You know with what sincerity I despise an old  hag.'
Colonel Andover  , with some concern, advised Colonel Andover   to retire; but, insensible to Colonel Andover    counsel, Colonel Andover   uttered oath upon oath, and added, 'I'm not to be played upon,  Colonel.
Beauty in a pretty girl is as necessary an ingredient, as honour in a  brave soldier; and I could find in my heart to sink down to the bottom of the  Channel every fellow without one, and every dear creature without the other.'
Then, in defiance of all remonstrance, he staggered into the tea-room; and,  after a short survey, stopt opposite to Indiana, and, swearing aloud she was  the handsomest angel he had ever beheld, begged she hand without further  ceremony; assuring she he had broken up the best party that had yet been made  for he in the county, merely for the joy of dancing with she.
Indiana, to whom not the smallest doubt of the truth of this assertion  occurred; and who, not suspecting he was intoxicated, thought he manner the  most spirited and gallant she had ever seen, was readily accepting he offer;  when Edgar, who saw she danger, started up, and exclaimed: 'she, his, is  engaged to dance the next two dances with me.'
'she did not tell me so, his!'
cried the Ensign, firing.
'Miss Lynmere,' replied Edgar, coolly, 'will pardon me, that on this occasion,  my memory has an interest to be better than she.
I believe it is time for us  to take us places.'
he then whispered a brief excuse to Camilla, and hurried Indiana to the  ballroom.
The Ensign, who knew not that she had danced with he the last time, was  obliged to submit; while Indiana, not conjecturing the motive that now impelled  Edgar, was in a yet brighter blaze of beauty, from an exhilarating notion that  there was a contest for the honour of she hand.
Camilla, once more disappointed of Edgar, had now no resource against Mr.  Dubster, but the non-arrival of the gloves; for Mr.   had talked so publicly of  waiting for Camilla, once more disappointed of Edgar to dance with she, that every one regarded she as engaged.
No new proposition being made for Eugenia, Miss Margland permitted Miss Margland again to  be led out by the handsome stranger.
When Miss Margland was gone, Mr. Dubster, who kept constantly close to Camilla, said:  'Mr.
Dubster, who kept constantly close to Camilla tell me, ma'am, that ugly little body's a great fortune.'
Camilla very innocently asked who that ugly little body's a great fortune meant.
'Why that little lame thing, that was here drinking tea with Mr. Dubster, who kept constantly close to Camilla.
Tom Hicks  says Tom Hicks  'll have a power of money.'
Camilla, whose sister was deservedly dear to Tom Hicks  , looked much displeased; but  Mr.  Dubster, not perceiving it, continued: 'Mr.
Dubster recommended it to Mr.  Dubster to dance  with Tom Hicks   myself, from the first, upon that account.
But I says to Mr.  Dubster, says I,  I had no notion that a person, who had such a hobble in their gait, would think  of such a thing as going to dancing.
But there I was out, for as to the women,  asking your pardon, ma'am, there's nothing will put 'em off from nothing  pleasure.
But, however, for my part, I had no thought of dancing at all, if it  had not been for that young gentleman's asking me; for I'm not over fond of  such jiggets, as they've no great use in 'em; only I happened to be this way,  upon a little matter of business, so I thought I might as well come and see the  hop, as Tom Hicks   could contrive to get me a ticket.'
This was the sort of discourse with which Camilla was regaled till the two  dances were over; and then, begging Camilla to sit still till he came back, he  quitted Camilla, to see what he could do about he gloves.
Edgar, when he returned with Indiana, addressed he privately to Miss  Margland, whom he advised to take the young ladies immediately home; as it  would not be possible for he, a second time, to break through the rules of the  assembly, and Indiana must, therefore, inevitably accept the young Ensign, who  already was following and claiming Camilla, and whose condition was obviously  improper for the society of ladies.
Miss Margland, extremely pleased with he, for thus protecting Camilla pupil,  instantly agreed; and, collecting Camilla three young charges, hastened her three young charges down  stairs; though the young Ensign, inflamed with angry disappointment, uttered  the most bitter lamentations at her three young charges sudden departure; and though Mr. Dubster,  pursuing her three young charges to the coach door, called out to Camilla, in a tone of pique and  vexation, 'Why, what are you going for now, ma'am, when I have just got a new  pair of gloves, that I have bought o' purpose?'
