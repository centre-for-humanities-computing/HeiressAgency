 A Way to make Friends  When Camilla appeared at the hall-door, a gentleman descended from the carriage  of Mrs. Berlinton, with an air the most melancholy, and eyes bent to the earth,  in the mournful bow with which he offered her his hand: though, when he had  assisted her into the coach, he raised them, and, turning round, cast upon the  mansion a look of desponding fondness, that immediately brought to her  recollection young Melmond, the Oxford student, and the brother of her new  friend.  Mrs. Berlinton received her with tenderness, folding her to her breast, and  declaring life to be now insupportable without her.  The affection of Camilla was nearly reciprocal, but her pleasure had no chance  of equal participation; nor was the suspensive state of her mind the only  impediment; opposite to her in the carriage, and immediately claiming her  attention, was Mrs. Mittin.  The agitating events which had filled up the short interval of her residence at  Cleves, had so completely occupied every faculty, that, till the affair of the  horse involved her in new difficulties, her debts had entirely flown her  remembrance; and the distressing scenes which immediately succeeded to that  forced recollection, made its duration as short as it was irksome; but the  sight of Mrs. Mittin brought it back with violence to her memory, and flashed  it, with shame, upon her conscience.  The twenty pounds, however, just given her by Sir Hugh, occurred at the same  moment to her thoughts; and she determined to repair her negligence, by  appropriating it into parcels for the payment of all she owed, before she  suffered sleep again to [close] her eyes.  Mrs. Berlinton informed her, that both herself and her brother had been  summoned to Southampton to meet Mrs. Ecton, the aunt by whom she had been  educated, who had just arrived there from Wales, upon some secret business,  necessary for her to hear, but which could not be revealed by letters.  The journey, though in itself short and pleasant, proved to Camilla long and  wearisome; the beauties of the prospect were acknowledged by her eye, but her  mind, dead to pleasure, refused to give them their merited effect. To the  charms of nature she could not be blind; her fervent imagination, and the  lessons of her youth, combined to do them justice; but she thought not of them  at this moment; hill, vale, or plain, were uninteresting, however beautiful; it  was Edgar she looked for; Edgar, who thus coldly had suffered her to depart,  but who still, it was possible, might pursue; and hope, ever active, painted  him, as she proceeded, in every distant object that caught her eye, whether  living or inanimate, brightening, from time to time, the roses of her cheeks  with the felicity of a speedy reconciliation; but upon every near approach, the  flattering error was detected, and neither hill, vale, nor plain, could dispel  the disappointment. A fine country, and diversified views, may soften even the  keenest affliction of decided misfortune, and tranquillise the most gloomy  sadness into resignation and composure; but suspense rejects the gentle  palliative; 'tis an absorbent of the faculties that suffers them to see, hear,  and feel only its own perplexity; and the finer the fibres of the sensibility  on which it seizes, the more exclusive is its despotism; doubt, in a fervent  mind, from the rapidity of its evolutions between fear in its utmost  despondence, and hope in its fullest rapture, is little short of torture.  They drove immediately to an elegant house, situated upon a small eminence,  half a mile without the town of Southampton, which had already been secured;  and Mrs. Berlinton, as soon as she had chosen the pleasantest apartment it  afforded for Camilla, and suffered Mrs. Mittin to choose the next pleasant for  herself, went, accompanied by her brother, to the lodging of Mrs. Ecton.  Left alone, Camilla stationed herself at a window, believing she meant to look  at the prospect; but her eye, faithful to her heart, roved up and down the high  road, and took in only chaises or horsemen, till Mrs. Mittin, with her  customary familiarity, came into the room. 'Well, my dear miss,' she cried,  'you're welcome to Southampton, and welcome to Mrs. Berlinton; she's a nice  lady as ever I knew; I suppose you're surprised to see us so great together?  but I'll tell you how it came about. You must know, just as you was gone, I  happened to be in the book shop when she came in, and asked for a book; the  Peruvan Letters she called it; and it was not at home, and she looked quite  vexed, for she said she had looked the catalogue up and down, and saw nothing  else she'd a mind to; so I thought it would be a good opportunity to oblige  her, and be a way to make a prodigious genteel acquaintance besides; so I took  down the name, and I found out the lady that had got the book, and I made her a  visit, and I told her it was particular wanted by a lady that had a reason; so  she let me have it, and I took it to my pretty lady, who was so pleased, she  did not know how to thank me: So this got me footing in the house; and there I  heard, amongst her people she was coming to Southampton, and was to call for  you, my dear miss; so when I found she had not her coach full, I ask'd her to  give me a cast; for I told her you'd be particular glad to see me, as we'd some  business to settle together, that was a secret between only us two; so she said  she would do anything to give you pleasure; so then I made free to ask her to  give me a night's lodging, till I could find out some friend to be at; for I'd  a vast mind to come to Southampton, as I could do it so reasonable, for I like  to go every where. And I dare say, my dear miss, if you'll tell her 'twill  oblige you, she'll make me the compliment to let me stay all the time, for I  know nobody here; though I don't fear making friends, go where I will. And you  know, my dear miss, you can do no less by me, considering what I've done for  you; for I've kept all the good people quiet about your debts; and they say you  may pay them when you will, as I told them you was such a rich heiress; which  Mr. Dubster let me into the secret of, for he had had it from your brother.'  Camilla now experienced the extremest repentance and shame, to find herself  involved in any obligation with a character so forward, vulgar, and  encroaching, and to impose such a person, through the abuse of her name and  influence, upon the time and patience of Mrs. Berlinton.  The report spread by Lionel she immediately disavowed, and, producing her  twenty pound bank note, begged Mrs. Mittin would have the goodness to get it  changed for her, and to discharge her accounts without delay.  Surprised by this readiness, and struck by the view of the note, Mrs. Mittin  imputed to mere reserve the denial of her expected wealth, but readily promised  to get in the bills, and see her clear.  Camilla would now have been left alone; but Mrs. Mittin thought of nothing less  than quitting her, and she knew not how to bid her depart. It was uncertain  when Mrs. Berlinton could return; to obviate, therefore, in some measure, the  fatigue of such conversation, Camilla proposed walking.  It was still but two o'clock, and the weather was delicious; every place that  opened to any view, presented some prospect that was alluring; Camilla,  notwithstanding her anxiety, was caught, and at intervals, at least, forgot all  within, from admiration of all without.  Mrs. Mittin led immediately to the town, and Camilla was struck with its  neatness, and surprised by its populousness. Mrs. Mittin assured her it was  nothing to London, and only wished she could walk her from Charing-cross to  Temple-bar, just to shew her what it was to see a little of the world.  'But now, my dear,' she cried, 'the thing is to find out what we've got to look  at; so don't let's go on without knowing what we're about; however, these shops  are all so monstrous smart, 'twill be a pleasure to go into them, and ask the  good people what there's to see in the town.'  This pretext proved so fertile to her of entertainment, in the opportunity it  afforded of taking a near view of the various commodities exposed to sale, that  while she entered almost every shop, with inquiries of what was worth seeing,  she attended to no answer nor information, but having examined and admired all  the goods within sight or reach, walked off, to obtain, by similar means, a  similar privilege further on; boasting to Camilla, that, by this clever device  they might see all that was smartest, without the expence of buying any thing.  It is possible that this might safely have been repeated, from one end of the  town to the other, had Mrs. Mittin been alone; and she seemed well disposed to  make the experiment; but Camilla, who, absent and absorbed, accompanied without  heeding her, was of a figure and appearance not quite so well adapted for  indulging with impunity such unbridled curiosity. The shopkeepers, who,  according to their several tastes or opinions, gave their directions to the  churches, the quays, the market-place, the antique gates, the town-hall, &c.  involuntarily looked at her as they answered the questioner, and not satisfied  with the short view, followed to the door, to look again; this presently  produced an effect that, for the whole length of the High-street, was amply  ridiculous; every one perceiving that, whatsoever had been his recommendation,  whether to the right, to the left, or straight forward, the two inquirers went  no further than into the next shop, whence they regularly drew forth either the  master or the man to make another starer at their singular proceeding.  Some supposed they were only seeking to attract notice; others thought they  were deranged in mind; and others, again, imagined they were shoplifters, and  hastened back to their counters, to examine what was missing of their goods.  Two men of the two last persuasions communicated to one another their opinions,  each sustaining his own with a positiveness that would have ended in a quarrel,  had it not been accommodated by a wager. To settle this became now so  important, that business gave way to speculation, and the contending parties,  accompanied by a young perfumer as arbitrator, leaving their affairs in the  hands of their wives, or their domestics, issued forth from their repositories,  to pursue and watch the curious travellers; laying bets by the way at almost  every shop as they proceeded, till they reached the quay, where the ladies made  a full stand, and their followers opened a consultation how best to decide the  contest.  Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,  declared he would keep aloof, for he should detect them best when they least  suspected they were observed.  Mr. Drim, a gentle and simple haberdasher, who believed their senses  disordered, made a circuit to face and examine them, frequently, however,  looking back, to see that no absconding trick was played him by his friends.  When he came up to them, the pensive and absorbed look of Camilla struck him as  too particular to be natural; and in Mrs. Mittin he immediately fancied he  perceived something wild, if not insane. In truth, an opinion preconceived of  her derangement might easily authorise strong suspicions of confirmation, from  the contented volubility with which she incessantly ran on, without waiting for  answerers, or even listeners; and his observation had not taught him, that the  loquacious desire only to speak. They exact time, not attention.  Mrs. Mittin, soon observing the curiosity with which he examined them, looked  at him so hard in return, talking the whole time, in a quick low voice, to  Camilla, upon his oddity, that, struck with a direful panic, in the persuasion  she was marking him for some mischief, he turned short about to get back to his  companions; leaving Mrs. Mittin with precisely the same opinion of himself  which he had imbibed of her.  'Well, my dear,' cried she, 'this is one of the most miraclous adventures I've  met with yet; as sure as you're alive that man that stares so is not right in  the head! for else what should he run away for, all in such a hurry, after  looking at us so particular for nothing? I'll assure you, I think the best  thing we can do, is to get off as fast as we can, for fear of the worst.'  They then sped their way from the quay; but, in turning down the first passage  to get out of sight, they were led into one of the little rooms prepared for  the accommodation of bathers.  This seemed so secure, as well as pleasant, that Camilla, soothed by the  tranquillity with which she could contemplate the noble Southampton water and  its fine banks, sat down at the window, and desired not to walk any further.  The fright with which Mr. Drim had retreated, gained no proselyte to his  opinion; Mr. Girt, the perfumer, asserted, significantly, they were only idle  travellers, of light character; and Mr. Firl, when in dodging them, he saw they  went into a bathing room, offered to double his wager that it was to make some  assortment of their spoil.  This was accepted, and it was agreed that one should saunter in the adjoining  passages to see which way they turned upon coming out, while the two others  should patrol the beach, to watch their disappearance from the windows.  Mrs. Mittin, meanwhile, was as much amused, though with different objects, as  Camilla. A large mixt party of ladies and gentlemen, who had ordered a vessel  for sailing down the water, which was not yet ready, now made their appearance;  and their dress, their air of enjoyment, their outcries of impatience, the  frisky gaiety of some, the noisy merriment of others, seemed to Mrs. Mittin  marks of so much grandeur and happiness, that all her thoughts were at work to  devise some contrivance for becoming of their acquaintance.  Camilla also surveyed, but almost without seeing them; for the only image of  her mind now unexpectedly met her view; Dr. Marchmont and Edgar, just arrived,  had patrolled to the beach, where Edgar, whose eye, from his eagerness,  appeared to be every where in a moment, immediately perceived her; they both  bowed, and Dr. Marchmont, amazed by the air and figure of her companion,  inquired if Mrs. Berlinton had any particularly vulgar relation to whom she was  likely to commit her fair guest.  Edgar, who had seen only herself, could not now forbear another glance; but the  aspect of Mrs. Mittin, without Mrs. Berlinton, or any other more dignified or  fitting protectress, was both unaccountable and unpleasant to him; he  recollected having seen her at Tunbridge, where the careless temper, and  negligent manners of Mrs. Arlbery, made all approaches easy, that answered any  purpose of amusement or ridicule; but he could not conceive how Mrs. Berlinton,  or Camilla herself, could be joined by such a companion.  Mr. Firl, having remarked these two gentlemen's bows, began to fear for his  wager; yet, thinking it authorised him to seek some information, approached  them, and taking off his hat, said: 'You seem to be noticing those two ladies  up there; pray, gentlemen, if you've no objection, who may they be?'  'Why do you ask, sir?' cried Edgar, sternly.  'Why, we've a wager depending upon them, sir, and I believe there's no  gentleman will refuse to help another about a wager.'  'A wager?' repeated Edgar, wishing, but vainly, to manifest no curiosity; 'what  inducement could you have to lay a wager about them?'  'Why, I believe, sir, there's nobody's a better judge than me what I've laid  about; though I may be out, to be sure, if you know the ladies; but I've seen  so much of their tricks, in my time, that they must be pretty sharp before  they'll over-reach me.'  'What tricks? who must be sharp? who are you talking of?'  'Shoplifters, sir.'  'Shoplifters! what do you mean?'  'No harm, sir; I may be out, to be sure, as I say; and if so, I ask pardon;  only, as we've laid the wager, I think I may speak before I pay.'  The curiosity of Edgar would have been converted into ridicule, had he been  less uneasy at seeing with whom Camilla was thus associated; Mrs. Mittin might  certainly be a worthy woman, and, if so, must merit every kindness that could  be shewn her; but her air and manner so strongly displayed the low bred society  to which she had been accustomed, that he foresaw nothing but improper  acquaintance, or demeaning adventures, that could ensue from such a connection  at a public place.  Dr. Marchmont demanded what had given rise to this suspicion.  Mr. Firl answered, that they had been into every shop in the town, routing over  every body's best goods, yet not laying out a penny.  Nothing of this could Edgar comprehend, except that Camilla had suffered  herself to be led about by Mrs. Mittin, entirely at her pleasure; but all  further inquiry was stopt, by the voluntary and pert junction of Girt, the  young perfumer, who, during this period, had by no means been idle; for  perceiving, in the group waiting for a vessel, a certain customer by whom he  knew such a subject would be well received, he contrived to excite his  curiosity to ask some questions, which could only be satisfied by the history  of the wager, and his own opinion that both parties were out.  This drew all eyes to the bathing room; and new bets soon were circulated,  consisting of every description of conjecture, or even possibility, except that  the two objects in question were innocent: and for that, in a set of fourteen,  only one was found who defended Camilla, though her face seemed the very index  of purity, which still more strongly was painted upon it than beauty, or even  than youth. Such is the prevalent disposition to believe in general depravity,  that while those who are debased themselves find a consolation in thinking  others equally worthless, those even, who are of a better sort, nourish a  secret vanity in supposing few as good as themselves; and fully, without  reflection, the fair candour of their minds, by aiding that insidious  degeneracy, which robs the community of all confidence in virtue.  The approach of the perfumer to Edgar had all the hardiness of vulgar elation,  bestowed, at this moment, by the recent encouragement of having been permitted  to propagate his facetious opinions in a society of gentlefolks; for though to  one only amongst them, a young man of large fortune, by whom he was  particularly patronised, he had presumed verbally to address himself, he had  yet the pleasure to hear his account repeated from one to another, till not a  person of the company escaped hearing it.  'My friend Firl's been telling you, I suppose, sir,' said he, to Edgar, 'of his  foolish wager? but, take my word for it....'  Here Edgar, who again had irresistibly looked up at the room, saw that the  three gentlemen had entered it; alarmed lest these surmises should be  productive of impertinence to Camilla, he darted quickly from the beach to her  immediate protection.  But the rapidity of his wishes were ill seconded by the uncertainty of his  footsteps; and while, with eyes eagerly wandering all around, he hastily pushed  forward, he was stopt by Mr. Drim, who told him to take care how he went on,  for, in one of those bathing houses, to the best of his belief, there were two  crazy women, one melancholy, and one stark wild, that had just, as he supposed,  escaped from their keepers.  'How shall I find my way, then, to another of the bathing houses?' cried Edgar.  Mr. Drim undertook to shew him where he might turn, but said he must not lose  sight of the door, because he had a bottle of port depending upon it; his  neighbour, Mr. Firl, insisting they were only shoplifters.  Edgar here stopt short and stared.  Drim then assured him it was what he could not believe, as nothing was missing;  though Mr. Firl would have it that it was days and days, sometimes, before  people found out what was gone; but he was sure, himself, they were touched in  the head, by their going about so wild, asking everybody the same questions,  and minding nobody's answers.  Edgar, convinced now Camilla was here again implicated, broke with disgust from  the man, and rushed to the door he charged him to avoid.
