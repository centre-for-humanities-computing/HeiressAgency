 Means to still Agitation  Declining all aid, Camilla continued in the same position, wrapt up, coveting  the dark, and stifling sighs that were rising into sobs, till she heard a  gentle tap at her door.  She started, but still hid herself: Mrs. Marl was already gone; Peggy answered  the summons, and returned to the bedside, with a note in her hand, begging  Camilla to take it, as it came from the gentleman who was to have read the  prayers.  'Is he then gone?' cried she, in a voice announcing deep disappointment.  'Yes, he went directly, my dear Lady.'  She threw the covering from her face, and with uplifted hands, exclaimed; 'O  Edgar! could you see me thus ... and leave me?'—Yet eagerly seizing the  letter, called for a candle, and strove to read it. But the characters seemed  double to her weak and dazzled eyes, and she was forced to relinquish the  attempt. She pressed it to her bosom, and again covered herself up.  Something, nevertheless, like internal revival, once more, to her own  unspeakable amazement, began fluttering at her breast. She had seen the beloved  of her heart—dearer to her far than the life she thought herself resigning;  seen him penetrated to anguish by her situation, awakened to the tenderest  recollections, and upon her hand had dropt a testimony of his sensibility,  that, dead as she had thought herself to the world, its views, its hopes, its  cares, passed straight to her heart—that wonderful repository of successive  emotions, whence the expulsion of one species of interest but makes way for the  entrance of another; and which vainly, while yet in mortal life, builds, even  from hour to hour, upon any chasm of mortal solicitude.  While wrapt up in this reverie, poignantly agitating, yet undefinably soothing,  upon the return of Edgar to England, and his astonishing appearance in her  room, her attention was again aroused by another gentle tap at the door.  Peggy opened it, and left the room; but soon came back, to beg an answer to the  note, for which the gentleman was waiting upon the stairs.  'Waiting?' she repeated, in extreme trepidation, 'is he not then gone?'  'No ma'am, only out of the room; he can't go away without the answer, he says.'  A sensation of pleasure was now so new to Camilla, as almost to be too potent  either for her strength or her intellects. She doubted all around her, doubted  what she heard, doubted even her existence. Edgar, could it be Edgar who was  waiting for an answer?... who was under the same roof—who had been in the  same room—who was now separated from her but by a thin wainscot?—'O no, no,  no!' she cried, 'my senses all delude me! one vision after another beguiles my  deranged imagination!' Yet she called Peggy to her again, again asked her if it  were indeed true; and, bidding her once more bring the candle, the new spirit  with which she was invigorated, enabled her to persevere in her efforts, till  she made out the following lines; which were sealed, but not directed.  'The sorrow, the tumult of my soul, I attempt not to paint.—Forgive, O  Camilla! an intrusion which circumstances made resistless. Deign to bury in  kind oblivion all remembrance but of our early friendship—our intuitive  attachment, our confidence, esteem, and happy juvenile intercourse; and under  such auspices—animated as they are innocent—permit me to hasten Mrs. Tyrold  to this spot, or trust me—I conjure—with the mystery of this dreadful  desolation—O Camilla!—by all the scenes that have passed between us—by  the impression indelible they have engraved upon my heart, wound not the most  faithful of your friends by rejecting his services!  E. M.'  Dissolved in tears of tenderness, relieving, nay delightful, she immediately  sent him word that she accepted his kind office, and should feel eternal  gratitude if he would acquaint her friends with her situation.  Peggy soon informed her the gentleman was gone; and she then inquired why he  had been brought to her as a clergyman.  The little girl gave the account with the utmost simplicity. Her mistress, she  said, knew the gentleman very well, who was 'Squire Mandlebert, and lived at a  great house not many miles off; and had just alighted to bait his horses, as  she went to ask about sending for the clergyman. He inquired who was ill; and  her Mistress said it was a Lady who had gone out of her mind, by seeing a dead  body, and raved of nothing but having prayers read to her; which her husband  would do, when his house was clear, if the humour lasted: for they had nobody  to send three miles off; and by drawing the curtains, she would not know if it  was a clergyman or not. The young 'Squire then asked if she was a lodger or a  traveller, and her mistress answered: 'She's a traveller, Sir; and if it had  not been for Peggy's knowing her, we should have been afraid who she might be;  for she stays here, and never pays us; only she has given us a watch and a  locket for pledges.' Then he asked on some more questions, continued Peggy, and  presently desired to see the locket; and when he had looked at it, he turned as  white as a sheet, and said he must see the lady. Her mistress said she was laid  down upon the bed, and she could not send in a gentleman; unless it was her  husband, just to quiet her poor head by reading her a prayer or too. So then  the 'Squire said he'd take the prayer book and read to her himself, if she'd  spare time to go in the room first, and shut up the curtains. So her mistress  said no, at first; but Peggy said the poor lady fretted on so badly, that  presently up they came together.  Ah! dear darling locket! internally cried Camilla, how from the first have I  loved—how to the last will I prize it! Ah dear darling locket! how for  ever—while I live—will I wear it in my bosom!  A calm now took place of her agonies that made her seem in a renovated  existence, till sleep, by gentle approaches, stole upon her again: not to bring  to her the dread vision which accompanied its first return; nor yet to allow  her tranquil repose. A softer form appeared before her; more afflictive, though  not so horrible; it was the form of her Mother; all displeasure removed from  her penetrating countenance; no longer in her dying child viewing the child  that had offended her; yet while forgiving and embracing, seeing her expire in  her arms.  She awakened, affrighted,—she started, she sat upright; she called aloud upon  her mother, and wildly looking round, thought she saw her at the foot of the  bed.  She crossed her eyes with her hands, to endeavour to clear her sight: but the  object only seemed more distinct. She bent forward, seeking conviction, yet  incredulous, though still meeting the same form.  Sighing, at last, from fruitless fatigue; ''Tis wondrous odd,' she cried, 'but  I now never know when I wake or when I sleep!'  The form glided away; but with motion so palpable, she could no longer believe  herself played upon by imagination. Awe-imprest, and wonder-struck, she softly  opened her side curtain to look after it. It had stopt by a high chest of  drawers, against which, leaning its head upon its arm, it stood erect, but  seemed weeping. She could not discern the face; but the whole figure had the  same sacred resemblance.  The pulses of her head beat now with so much violence, she was forced to hold  her temples. Doubt, dread, and hope seized every faculty at once; till, at  length, the upraised arm of the form before her dropt, and she distinctly saw  the profile: 'It is herself! it is my Mother!' she screamed, rather than  pronounced, and threw herself from the bed to the floor.  'Yes! it is your Mother!' was repeated, in a tone solemn and penetrating;—'to  what a scene, O Camilla, returned! her house abandoned ... her son in exile ...  her Eugenia lost ... her husband, the prop of all!... where she dare not  name!... and thou, the child of her bosom!... the constant terrour, yet  constant darling of her soul ... where, and how, does she see, does she meet  thee, again—O Camilla!'  Then tenderly, though with anguish, bending over her, she would have raised,  and helped her to return to the bed: but Camilla would not be aided; she would  not lift up her eyes; her face sought the ground, where leaning it upon her  hands, without desiring to speak, without wishing to stir, torn by  self-reproaches that made her deem herself unworthy to live, she remained  speechless, immoveable.  'Repress, repress,' said Mrs. Tyrold, gently, yet firmly, 'these strong  feelings, uselessly torturing to us both. Raise your head, my poor girl ...  raise ... and repose it upon the breast of your Mother.'  'Of my Mother?' repeated Camilla, in a voice hardly audible; 'have I a  Mother—who again will own the blast of her hopes and happiness?—the  disgrace, the shame of the best and most injured of Fathers!'  'Let us pray,' said Mrs. Tyrold, with a sigh, 'that these evils may pass away,  and by salutary exertions, not desponding repinings, earn back our fugitive  peace.'  Again she then would have raised her; but Camilla sunk from all assistance:  'No,' she cried, 'I am unworthy your lenity—I am unable even to bear it, ...'  'Camilla,' said Mrs. Tyrold, steadily, 'it is time to conquer this impetuous  sensibility, which already, in its effects, has nearly broken all our hearts.  With what horrour have we missed—with what agony sought you! Now then, that  at length, we find you, excite not new terrour, by consigning yourself to  willing despair.'  Struck with extreme dread of committing yet further wrong, she lifted up her  head, with intention to have risen; but the weak state of her body, forgotten  by herself, and by Mrs. Tyrold unsuspected, took its turn for demanding  attention.  'Alas! my poor Child,' cried she, 'what horrible havock has this short absence  produced! O Camilla!... with a soul of feeling like yours,—strong, tender,  generous, and but too much alive, how is it you can thus have forgotten the  first ties of your duty, and your heart, and have been wrought upon by your own  sorrows to forget the sorrows you inflict? Why have you thus fled us? thus  abandoned yourself to destruction? Was our anger to be set in competition with  our misery? Was the fear of displeasure, from parents who so tenderly love you,  to be indulged at the risk of never ending regret to the most lenient of  Fathers? and nearly the loss of senses to a Mother who, from your birth, has  idolized you in her inmost soul?'  Bending then over her, she folded her in her arms; where Camilla, overpowered  with the struggles of joy and contrition, sunk nearly lifeless.  Mrs. Tyrold, seeing now her bodily feebleness, put her to bed, with words of  soothing tenderness, no longer blended with retrospective investigation;  conjuring her to be calm, to remember whose peace and happiness were encircled  in her life and health, and to remit to her fuller strength all further  interesting discourse.  'Ah, my Mother!' cried Camilla, 'tell me first—if the time may ever come when  with truth you can forgive me?'  'Alas, my darling Child!' answered the generous Mother, 'I have myself now to  pardon that I forgave thee not at first!'  Camilla seemed transported to another region; with difficulty Mrs. Tyrold could  hold her in her bed, though hovering over her pillow with incessant caresses:  but to raise her eye only to meet that of her Mother—not as her fertile  terrour had prophesied, darting unrelenting ire, but softly solicitous, and  exquisitely kind; to feel one loved hand anxiously upon her forehead, and to  glue her own lips upon the other; to find fears that had made existence  insupportable, transformed into security that rendered it delicious;—with a  floating, uncertain, yet irrepressible hope, that to Edgar she owed this  restoration, caused a revulsion in all her feelings, that soon operated upon  her frame—not, indeed, with tranquillity, but with rapture approaching to  delirium:—when suddenly, a heavy, lumbering noise, appalled her. 'Ah, my  Mother!' she faintly cried, 'our beloved Eugenia!... that noise ... where—and  how—is Eugenia?—The wretched Mr. Bellamy is no more!'  Mrs. Tyrold answered, she was acquainted with the whole dreadful business, and  would relate it in a season of more serenity; but meanwhile, as repose, she  well knew, never associated with suspence, she satisfied immediate anxiety, by  assurances that Eugenia was safe, and at Etherington.  This was a joy scarce inferior to that which so recently had transported her:  but Mrs. Tyrold, gathering from the good Peggy, that she had not been in bed,  nor scarce tasted food, since she had been at the half-way-house, refused all  particulars, till she had been refreshed with nourishment and rest. The first  immediately was ordered, and immediately taken; and Mrs. Tyrold, to propitiate  the second, insisted upon total silence, and prepared to sit up with her all  night.  Long as the extreme agitation of her spirits distanced  'Tir'd Nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep',[7] the change from so much misery to heart-felt peace and joy, with the judicious  nursing and restoratives devised by Mrs. Tyrold, for her weak and half famished  frame, made her slumber, when at length, it arrived, lasted so long that,  though broken by frequent starts, she awoke not till late the next morning.  Her eyes then opened upon a felicity that again made her think herself in a new  world. Her Mother, leaning over her, was watching her breathe, with hands  uplifted for her preservation, and looks of fondness which seemed to mark that  her happiness depended upon its being granted; but as she raised herself, to  throw her arms around the loved maternal neck, the shadow of another form,  quickly, yet gently receding, struck her sight; ... 'Ah, Heaven!' she  exclaimed, 'who is that?'  'Will you be good,' said Mrs. Tyrold, gently, 'be tranquil, be composed, and  earn that I should tell you who has been watching by you this hour?'  Camilla could not answer; certain, now, who it must be, her emotions became  again uncontrollable; her horrour, her remorse, her self-abhorrence revived,  and agonizingly exclaiming, ''Tis my Father!—O, where can I hide my head?'  She strove again to envelop herself with the bed-curtain from all view.  'Here—in his own arms—upon his own breast you shall hide it,' said Mr.  Tyrold, returning to the bed-side, 'and all now shall be forgotten, but  thankfulness that our afflictions seem finding their period.'  'O my Father! my Father!' cried Camilla, forgetting her situation, in her  desire to throw herself at his feet, 'can you speak to me thus, after the  woe—the disgrace I have brought upon you?—I deserve your malediction!... I  expected to be shut out from your heart,—I thought myself abandoned—I  looked forward only in death to receiving your forgiveness!—'  Mrs. Tyrold held her still, while her Father now blessed and embraced her, each  uttering, in the same moment, whatever was softest to console her: but all her  quick feelings were re-awakened beyond their power to appease them; her  penitence tortured, her very gratitude tore her to pieces: 'O my Mother,' she  cried, 'how do you forbear to spurn me? Can you think of what is passed, and  still pronounce your pardon? Will you not draw it back at the sight of my  injured Father? Are you not tempted to think I deserve eternal banishment from  you both?—and to repent that you have not ordered it?'  'No, my dearest Child, no! I lament only that I took you not at once to your  proper security—to these arms, my Camilla, that now so fondly infold you! to  this bosom—my darling girl!—where my heart beats your welcome!'  'You make me too—too happy! the change is almost killing! my Mother—my  dearest Mother!—I did not think you would permit me to ever call you so  again! My Father I knew would pardon me, for the chief suffering was his own;  but even he, I never expected could look at me thus benignly again! and  hardly—hardly would he have been tried, if the evil had been reversed!'  Mr. Tyrold exhorted her to silent composure; but finding her agitation  over-power even her own efforts, he summoned her to join him in solemn thanks  for her restoration.  Awfully, though most gratefully, impressed by such a call, she checked her  emotion, and devoutly obeyed: and the short but pious ceremony quieted her  nerves, and calmed her mind.  The gentlest tranquillity then took place in her breast, of the tumultuous joy  which had first chaced her deadly affliction. The soothing, however serious  turn, given by devotion to her changed sensations, softened the acute excess of  rapture which mounted felicity nearly to agony. More eloquent, as well as safer  than any speech, was the pause of deep gratitude, the silence of humble praise,  which ensued. Camilla, in each hand held one of each beloved Parent;  alternately she pressed them with grateful reverence to her lips, alternately  her eye sought each revered countenance, and received, in the beaming fondness  they emitted, a benediction that was balm to every woe.
