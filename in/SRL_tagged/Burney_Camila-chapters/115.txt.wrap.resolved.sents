 Means to still Agitation  Declining all aid, Camilla continued in the same position, wrapt up, coveting  the dark, and stifling sighs that were rising into sobs, till Camilla heard a  gentle tap at Camilla door.
Camilla started, but still hid Camilla: Mrs. Marl was already gone; Peggy answered  the summons, and returned to the bedside, with a note in Camilla hand, begging  Camilla to take it, as it came from the gentleman who was to have read the  prayers.
'Is he then gone?'
cried Peggy, in a voice announcing deep disappointment.
'Yes, he went directly, my dear Lady.'
Peggy threw the covering from Peggy face, and with uplifted hands, exclaimed; 'O  Edgar!
could you see me thus ... and leave me?
'—Yet eagerly seizing the  letter, called for a candle, and strove to read me?'—Yet.
But the characters seemed  double to Peggy weak and dazzled eyes, and Peggy was forced to relinquish the  attempt.
Peggy pressed the  attempt to Peggy bosom, and again covered Peggy up.
Something, nevertheless, like internal revival, once more, to Peggy own  unspeakable amazement, began fluttering at Peggy breast.
Peggy had seen the beloved  of Peggy heart—dearer to Peggy far than the life Peggy thought Peggy resigning;  seen him penetrated to anguish by Peggy situation, awakened to the tenderest  recollections, and upon Peggy hand had dropt a testimony of him sensibility,  that, dead as Peggy had thought Peggy to the world, its views, its hopes, its  cares, passed straight to Peggy heart—that wonderful repository of successive  emotions, whence the expulsion of one species of interest but makes way for the  entrance of another; and which vainly, while yet in mortal life, builds, even  from hour to hour, upon any chasm of mortal solicitude.
While wrapt up in this reverie, poignantly agitating, yet undefinably soothing,  upon the return of Edgar to England, and Edgar astonishing appearance in her  room, her attention was again aroused by another gentle tap at the door.
Peggy opened the door, and left her  room; but soon came back, to beg an answer to the  note, for which the gentleman was waiting upon the stairs.
'Waiting?'
Peggy repeated, in extreme trepidation, 'is the gentleman not then gone?'
'No ma'am, only out of her  room; the gentleman can't go away without the answer, the gentleman says.'
A sensation of pleasure was now so new to Peggy, as almost to be too potent  either for Peggy strength or Peggy intellects.
Peggy doubted all around Peggy, doubted  what Peggy heard, doubted even Peggy existence.
Edgar, could it be Edgar who was  waiting for an answer?...
who was under the same roof—who had been in the  same room—who was now separated from Peggy but by a thin wainscot?—'O no, no,  no!'
Peggy cried, 'my senses all delude me!
one vision after another beguiles my  deranged imagination!'
Yet Peggy called Peggy to Peggy again, again asked Peggy if it  were indeed true; and, bidding Peggy once more bring the candle, the new spirit  with which Peggy was invigorated, enabled Peggy to persevere in Peggy efforts, till  Peggy made out the following lines; which were sealed, but not directed.
'The sorrow, the tumult of my soul, I attempt not to paint.—Forgive, O  Camilla!
an intrusion which circumstances made resistless.
Deign to bury in  kind oblivion all remembrance but of our early friendship—our intuitive  attachment, our confidence, esteem, and happy juvenile intercourse; and under  such auspices—animated as they are innocent—permit me to hasten Mrs. Tyrold  to this spot, or trust me—I conjure—with the mystery of this dreadful  desolation—O Camilla!—by all the scenes that have passed between us—by  the impression indelible they have engraved upon my heart, wound not the most  faithful of your friends by rejecting his services!
E. M.'  Dissolved in tears of tenderness, relieving, nay delightful, E. M.'  Dissolved immediately  sent E. M.'  Dissolved word that E. M.'  Dissolved accepted E. M.'  Dissolved kind office, and should feel eternal  gratitude if E. M.'  Dissolved would acquaint E. M.'  Dissolved friends with E. M.'  Dissolved situation.
Peggy soon informed Peggy the gentleman was gone; and Peggy then inquired why the gentleman  had been brought to Peggy as a clergyman.
Peggy gave the account with the utmost simplicity.
Mistress, Peggy  said, knew the gentleman very well, who was 'Squire Mandlebert, and lived at a  great house not many miles off; and had just alighted to bait Squire Mandlebert horses, as  Peggy went to ask about sending for a clergyman.
a clergyman inquired who was ill; and  Mistress said it was a Lady who had gone out of Peggy mind, by seeing a dead  body, and raved of nothing but having prayers read to Peggy; which Peggy husband  would do, when her husband   was clear, if the humour lasted: for they had nobody  to send three miles off; and by drawing the curtains, Peggy would not know if it  was a clergyman or not.
The young 'Squire then asked if Peggy was a lodger or a  traveller, and Mistress answered: 'Mistress's a traveller, Sir; and if it had  not been for Peggy's knowing Mistress, we should have been afraid who Mistress might be;  for Mistress stays here, and never pays we; only Mistress has given we a watch and a  locket for pledges.'
Then 'Squire asked on some more questions, continued Peggy, and  presently desired to see a  locket for pledges; and when 'Squire had looked at a  locket for pledges, 'Squire turned as  white as a sheet, and said 'Squire must see the lady.
the lady said Mistress was laid  down upon the bed, and Mistress could not send in a gentleman; unless it was Mistress  husband, just to quiet Mistress poor head by reading Mistress a prayer or too.
So then  the 'Squire said the 'Squire'd take the prayer book and read to the 'Squire, if Mistress'd  spare time to go in the room first, and shut up the curtains.
So Mistresssaid no, at first; but Peggy said the lady fretted on so badly, that  presently up they came together.
Ah!
a  locket for pledges!
internally cried Camilla, how from the first have I  loved—how to the last will I prize the last!
Ah a  locket for pledges!
how for  ever—while I live—will I wear the last in my bosom!
A calm now took place of Camilla agonies that made Camilla seem in a renovated  existence, till sleep, by gentle approaches, stole upon Camilla again: not to bring  to Camilla the dread vision which accompanied its first return; nor yet to allow  Camilla tranquil repose.
A softer form appeared before Camilla; more afflictive, though  not so horrible; A softer form was the form of Camilla Mother; all displeasure removed from  Camilla penetrating countenance; no longer in Camilla dying child viewing the child  that had offended Camilla; yet while forgiving and embracing, seeing Camilla expire in  Camilla arms.
Camilla awakened, affrighted,—she started, Camilla sat upright; Camilla called aloud upon  Camilla mother, and wildly looking round, thought Camilla saw Camilla at the foot of the  bed.
Camilla crossed Camilla eyes with Camilla hands, to endeavour to clear Camilla sight: but the  object only seemed more distinct.
Camilla bent forward, seeking conviction, yet  incredulous, though still meeting the same form.
Sighing, at last, from fruitless fatigue; ''Tis wondrous odd,' Camilla cried, 'but  I now never know when I wake or when I sleep!'
The form glided away; but with motion so palpable, Camilla could no longer believe  Camilla played upon by imagination.
Awe-imprest, and wonder-struck, Camilla softly  opened Camilla side curtain to look after it.
it had stopt by a high chest of  drawers, against which, leaning it head upon it arm, it stood erect, but  seemed weeping.
Camilla could not discern the face; but the whole figure had the  same sacred resemblance.
The pulses of its head beat now with so much violence, Camilla was forced to hold  Camilla temples.
Doubt, dread, and hope seized every faculty at once; till, at  length, the upraised arm of the form before Camilla dropt, and Camilla distinctly saw  the profile: 'It is Camilla!
it is my Mother!'
Camilla screamed, rather than  pronounced, and threw Camilla from the bed to the floor.
'Yes!
it is your Mother!'
was repeated, in a tone solemn and penetrating;—'to  what a scene, O Camilla, returned!
Camilla house abandoned ... Camilla son in exile ...  Camilla Eugenia lost ... her Eugenia husband, the prop of all!...
where her Eugenia dare not  name!...
and thou, the child of her Eugenia !...
the constant terrour, yet  constant darling of her Eugenia soul ... where, and how, does her Eugenia see, does her Eugenia meet  thee, again—O Camilla!'
Then tenderly, though with anguish, bending over her Eugenia, her Eugenia would have raised,  and helped her Eugenia to return to the bed: but Peggy would not be aided; Peggy would  not lift up Peggy eyes; Peggy face sought the ground, where leaning it upon Peggy  hands, without desiring to speak, without wishing to stir, torn by  self-reproaches that made Peggy deem Peggy unworthy to live, Peggy remained  speechless, immoveable.
'Repress, repress,' said Mrs. Tyrold, gently, yet firmly, 'these strong  feelings, uselessly torturing to us both.
Raise your head, my poor girl ...  raise ... and repose it upon the breast of your Mother.'
'Of my Mother?'
repeated Peggy, in a voice hardly audible; 'have I a  Mother—who again will own the blast of ' repeated Camilla hopes and happiness?—the  disgrace, the shame of the best and most injured of Fathers!'
'Let us pray,' said Mrs. Tyrold, with a sigh, 'that these evils may pass away,  and by salutary exertions, not desponding repinings, earn back us fugitive  peace.'
Again ' repeated Camilla then would have raised ' repeated Camilla; but Peggy sunk from all assistance:  'No,' Peggy cried, 'I am unworthy your lenity—I am unable even to bear it, ...'  Peggy,' said Mrs. Tyrold, steadily, 'it is time to conquer this impetuous  sensibility, which already, in its effects, has nearly broken all our hearts.
With what horrour have our missed—with what agony sought you!
Now then, that  at length, our find you, excite not new terrour, by consigning yourself to  willing despair.'
Struck with extreme dread of committing yet further wrong, Peggy lifted up Peggy  head, with intention to have risen; but the weak state of Peggy body, forgotten  by Peggy, and by Mrs. Tyrold   unsuspected, took its turn for demanding  attention.
'Alas!
my poor Child,' cried Child, 'what horrible havock has this short absence  produced!
O Peggy!...
with a soul of feeling like yours,—strong, tender,  generous, and but too much alive, how is it you can thus have forgotten the  first ties of your duty, and your heart, and have been wrought upon by your own  sorrows to forget the sorrows you inflict?
Why have you thus fled us?
thus  abandoned yourself to destruction?
Was us anger to be set in competition with  us misery?
Was the fear of displeasure, from parents who so tenderly love you,  to be indulged at the risk of never ending regret to the most lenient of  Fathers?
and nearly the loss of senses to a Mother who, from your birth, has  idolized you in her inmost soul?'
Bending then over her, her folded her in her ; where Peggy, overpowered  with the struggles of joy and contrition, sunk nearly lifeless.
Mrs. Tyrold  , seeing now Mrs. Tyrold   bodily feebleness, put Mrs. Tyrold   to bed, with words of  soothing tenderness, no longer blended with retrospective investigation;  conjuring Mrs. Tyrold   to be calm, to remember whose peace and happiness were encircled  in Mrs. Tyrold   life and health, and to remit to Mrs. Tyrold   fuller strength all further  interesting discourse.
'Ah, my Mother!'
cried Peggy, 'tell me first—if the time may ever come when  with truth you can forgive me?'
'Alas, my poor Child!'
answered my Mother, 'I have my poor Child now to  pardon that I forgave my Mother not at first!'
Peggy seemed transported to another region; with difficulty Mrs. Tyrold   could  hold Peggy in Peggy bed, though hovering over Peggy pillow with incessant caresses:  but to raise Peggy eye only to meet that of my Mother—not as my Mother fertile  terrour had prophesied, darting unrelenting ire, but softly solicitous, and  exquisitely kind; to feel one loved hand anxiously upon terrour forehead, and to  glue terrour own lips upon the other; to find fears that had made existence  insupportable, transformed into security that rendered it delicious;—with a  floating, uncertain, yet irrepressible hope, that to Edgar terrour owed this  restoration, caused a revulsion in all terrour feelings, that soon operated upon  terrour frame—not, indeed, with tranquillity, but with rapture approaching to  delirium:—when suddenly, a heavy, lumbering noise, appalled terrour.
'Ah, my  Mother!'
terrour faintly cried, 'our beloved Eugenia!...
that noise ... where—and  —is Eugenia?—The wretched Mr. Bellamy is no more!'
Mrs. Tyrold   answered, Mrs. Tyrold   was acquainted with the whole dreadful business, and  would relate it in a season of more serenity; but meanwhile, as repose, Mrs. Tyrold    well knew, never associated with suspence, Mrs. Tyrold   satisfied immediate anxiety, by  assurances that our beloved Eugenia was safe, and at Etherington.
This was a joy scarce inferior to that which so recently had transported Mrs. Tyrold  :  but Mrs. Tyrold, gathering from the good Peggy, that Mrs. Tyrold   had not been in bed,  nor scarce tasted food, since Mrs. Tyrold   had been at the half-way-house, refused all  particulars, till Mrs. Tyrold   had been refreshed with nourishment and rest.
The first  immediately was ordered, and immediately taken; and Mrs. Tyrold  , to propitiate  the second, insisted upon total silence, and prepared to sit up with Mrs. Tyrold   all  night.
Long as the extreme agitation of Mrs. Tyrold   spirits distanced  'Tir'd Nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep',[7] the change from so much misery to heart-felt peace and joy, with the judicious  nursing and restoratives devised by Mrs. Tyrold  , for Mrs. Tyrold   weak and half famished  frame, made Mrs. Tyrold   slumber, when at length, it arrived, lasted so long that,  though broken by frequent starts, Mrs. Tyrold   awoke not till late the next morning.
Mrs. Tyrold   eyes then opened upon a felicity that again made Mrs. Tyrold   think Mrs. Tyrold   in a new  world.
my Mother, leaning over Mrs. Tyrold  , was watching my Mother breathe, with hands  uplifted for Mrs. Tyrold   preservation, and looks of fondness which seemed to mark that  Mrs. Tyrold   happiness depended upon its being granted; but as Mrs. Tyrold   raised Mrs. Tyrold  , to  throw her arms around the loved maternal neck, the shadow of another form,  quickly, yet gently receding, struck Mrs. Tyrold   sight; ... 'Ah, Heaven!'
Mrs. Tyrold    exclaimed, 'who is that?'
'Will you be good,' said Mrs. Tyrold, gently, 'be tranquil, be composed, and  earn that I should tell you who has been watching by you this hour?'
Peggy could not answer; certain, now, who it must be, Peggy emotions became  again uncontrollable; Peggy horrour, Peggy remorse, Peggy self-abhorrence revived,  and agonizingly exclaiming, ''Tis my Father!—O, where can I hide my head?'
Peggy strove again to envelop Peggy with the bed-curtain from all view.
'Here—in his own arms—upon his own breast you shall hide his own breast,' said Mrs. Tyrold  , returning to the bed-side, 'and all now shall be forgotten, but  thankfulness that our afflictions seem finding our afflictions period.'
'O my Father!
my Father!'
cried Peggy, forgetting Peggy situation, in Peggy  desire to throw Peggy at his feet, 'can you speak to his thus, after the  woe—the disgrace I have brought upon you?—I deserve your malediction!...
I  expected to be shut out from your heart,—I thought his abandoned—I  looked forward only in death to receiving your forgiveness!—'  Mrs. Tyrold   held Mrs. Tyrold   still, while Mrs. Tyrold   Father now blessed and embraced Mrs. Tyrold  , each  uttering, in the same moment, whatever was softest to console Mrs. Tyrold  : but all Mrs. Tyrold    quick feelings were re-awakened beyond all her  quick feelings power to appease all her  quick feelings; Mrs. Tyrold    penitence tortured, Mrs. Tyrold   very gratitude tore Mrs. Tyrold   to pieces: 'O my Mother,' Mrs. Tyrold    cried, 'how do you forbear to spurn me?
Can you think of what is passed, and  still pronounce your pardon?
Will you not draw it back at the sight of my  injured Father?
Are you not tempted to think I deserve eternal banishment from  you both?—and to repent that you have not ordered it?'
'No, my dearest Child, no!
I lament only that I took you not at once to your  proper security—to these arms, PeggyPeggy, that now so fondly infold you!
to  this bosom—my darling girl!—where my heart beats your welcome!'
'You make me too—too happy!
the change is almost killing!
my Mother—my  dearest Mother!—I did not think you would permit me to ever call you so  again!
My Father I knew would pardon me, for the chief suffering was My Father I knew own;  but even My Father I knew, I never expected could look at My Father I knew thus benignly again!
and  hardly—hardly would My Father I knew have been tried, if the evil had been reversed!'
Mrs. Tyrold   exhorted Mrs. Tyrold   to silent composure; but finding Mrs. Tyrold   agitation  over-power even Mrs. Tyrold   own efforts, Mrs. Tyrold   summoned Mrs. Tyrold   to join My Father I knew in solemn thanks  for Mrs. Tyrold   restoration.
Awfully, though most gratefully, impressed by such a call, Mrs. Tyrold   checked Mrs. Tyrold    emotion, and devoutly obeyed: and the short but pious ceremony quieted her  nerves, and calmed Mrs. Tyrold   mind.
The gentlest tranquillity then took place in Mrs. Tyrold   breast, of the tumultuous joy  which had first chaced Mrs. Tyrold   deadly affliction.
The soothing, however serious  turn, given by devotion to Mrs. Tyrold   changed sensations, softened the acute excess of  rapture which mounted felicity nearly to agony.
More eloquent, as well as safer  than any speech, was the pause of deep gratitude, the silence of humble praise,  which ensued.
Peggy, in each hand held one of each beloved Parent;  alternately Peggy pressed each hand with grateful reverence to Peggy lips, alternately  Peggy eye sought each revered countenance, and received, in the beaming fondness  each hand emitted, a benediction that was balm to every woe.
