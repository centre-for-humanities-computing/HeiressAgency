 A Lover's Eye  The serenity of virtue would now again have made The serenity of virtue abode the breast of Mr.  Tyrold, but for the constant wretchedness to which Mr.   saw Mr.   daughter a prey.  With the benignest pity Mr.   strove to revive his daughter; a pity unabated by any wonder,  unalloyed with any blame. Mr.   wonder fell all upon Edgar, whom Mr.   considered as  refining away mortal happiness, by dissatisfaction that it was not divine; but  Mr.   censure, which Mr.   reserved wholly for vice, exonerated wholly for vice both. Still,  however, Mr.   flattered Mr.   that ere long, to her youthful mind and native  cheerfulness, tranquillity, if not felicity, would imperceptibly return, from  such a union for exertion of filial and sisterly duties: that industry would  sweeten rest, virtue gild privation, and self-approvance convert every  sacrifice into enjoyment.  But peace such as this was far from her bosom. While the desertion of Edgar had  tolled the death bell to all her hopes, an unremitting contention disturbed her  mind, whether to avow or conceal her situation with regard to the money-lender.  The reflections of every night brought a dissatisfaction in her conduct, which  determined her upon an openness the most undisguised for the following morning:  but timidity, and the desire of reprieve from the fearful task, again, the  following morning, regularly postponed her purpose.  In the first horror occasioned by her father's distress from the bills of her  brother, her wrote a supplicating letter to Mrs. Mittin, to intreat her would  endeavour to quiet her creditors till her could arrange something for her creditors  payment. And while this produced a correspondence replete with danger,  difficulty, and impropriety, a new circumstance occurred, which yet more  cruelly embittered her conflicting emotions. her, in the virtuous eagerness  of her heart to forward the general œconomy, insisted wholly to relinquish,  for this year, her appropriate allowance; declaring that, by careful  management, her could dispense with anything new, and that the very few  expences her might find utterly unavoidable, her would demand from time to time  as they occurred. her, at this proposition, retreated, in agony, to her  chamber. To make the same was impossible; for how, then, find interest for the  money-lender? yet to withstand so just an example, seemed a disgrace to every  duty and every feeling.  Lavinia, who, in her countenance and abrupt departure, read the new distress  her had incautiously excited, with a thousand self-reproaches followed her. her  had considered but the common cause when her spoke, without weighing the  strange appearance of not being seconded by her sister: But her mind was  amongst the last to covet the narrow praise of insidious comparison; and her  concern for the proposal her had made, when her saw its effect, was as deep as  that of her in hearing it, though not attended with the same aggravations.  Mr. Tyrold remained utterly surprized. The generous and disinterested nature of  her, made it impossible to suspect her restrained by a greater love of  money than Lavinia; and Mr. Tyrold could not endure to suppose her late visits to  public places, had rendered personal œconomy more painful. But Mr. Tyrold would make  no enquiry that might seem a reproach; nor suffer any privation or contribution  that was not cheerful and voluntary.  The purchases for the wedding of Miss Dennel being now made, that young lady  came down to the country to solemnize young lady   nuptials, accompanied by Mrs. Mittin,  who instantly visited her. young lady   could settle nothing, young lady   said, with the  money-lender, without the premium; but young lady   had coaxed all the creditors, by  assuring all the creditors, that, as the debtor was a great heiress, all the creditors were certain of  all the creditors money when young lady   came to young lady   estate. young lady   could not endure to owe their  forbearance to a falsehood; though to convince Mrs. Mittin of young lady   errour, in  contradiction to the assertion of Lionel, was a vain attempt. The business,  however, pressed; and to keep back these but too just claimants was young lady   present  most fervent desire. Mrs. Mittin of her errour was amongst the most expert of  expedient-mongers, and soon started a method for raising the premium. Mrs. Mittin of her errour asked  to look at what young lady   possessed of trinkets: and the prize ear-rings of  Tunbridge, the ear-rings and necklace of Southampton, and several small toys  occasionally given Mrs. Mittin of her errour, were collected. The locket Mrs. Mittin of her errour also demanded, to make  weight; but neither that, nor the peculiar gifts, as keep-sakes, of Mrs. Mittin of her errour father,  mother, or uncle, consisting of a seal, a ring, and a watch, would Mrs. Mittin of her errour part  with. What Mrs. Mittin of her errour would relinquish, however, Mrs. Mittin of her errour disposed of to one of Mrs. Mittin of her errour  numerous friends; but her  numerous friends raised only, when intrinsically valued, sixteen  pounds. Mrs. Mittin of her errour then insisted upon coming forward with a contribution of every  trinket Mrs. Mittin of her errour was worth, save what had the same sacred motives of detention: and  the twenty pounds, without any ceremony of acknowledgment, were delivered to  Mr. Clykes; who then took into his own hands the payment of the hundred and  eighteen pounds; for which his received a bond, signed by Camilla, and witnessed  by Mrs. Mittin of her errour; and another note of hand, promising ten per cent. interest for  the sum, till the principal were repaid. These two notes, his acknowledged, were  mere pledges of honour, as the law would treat Mrs. Mittin of her errour as an infant: but his never  acted without the law would treat her as an infant, as the law would treat her as an infant prevented mistakes in private dealings.  This important affair arranged, Mrs. Mittin of her errour felt somewhat more at ease; Mrs. Mittin of her errour was  relieved from hourly alarms, and left the mistress to make Mrs. Mittin of her errour confession as  circumstances directed. But Mrs. Mittin of her errour obtained not for nothing the agency of Mrs.  Mittin, who was not a character to leave self out of consideration in Mrs. Mittin of her errour  transactions for others; and at every visit made at Etherington from this time,  Mrs. Mittin of her errour observed something in the apparel of Mrs. Mittin of her errour that was utterly old  fashioned, or too mean for Mrs. Mittin of her errour to wear; but which would do well enough for  Mrs. Mittin of her errour, when vamped up, as Mrs. Mittin of her errour knew how. Mrs. Mittin of her errour obligations and inexperience made  it impossible to Mrs. Mittin of her errour to resist, though, at this season of saving care, Mrs. Mittin of her errour gave  up nothing which Mrs. Mittin of her errour could not have rendered useful, by industry and  contrivance.  During this unhappy period at Etherington, a brighter, though not unclouded  scene, was exhibited at Cleves. Melmond arrived; Melmond was permitted to pay Melmondaddresses to the fair Indiana, and believed felicity celestial accorded to Melmond  even upon earth.  But this adored object herself suffered some severe repining at this adored object herself fate, when  this adored object herself saw, from this adored object herself window, this adored object herself lover gallop into the park without equipage,  without domestics, and mounted on a hired horse. The grimacing shrugs of Miss  Margland shewed this adored object herself entered into this mortification; and they were nearly  conspiring to dismiss the ignoble pretender, when a letter, which he modestly  sent up, from he sister, inviting the fair Indiana to pass a few weeks in Grosvenor  Square, once again secured the interest of the brother. this adored object herself suffered,  therefore, he to hand this adored object herself down stairs, and Melmond thought  he the most blest of men.  The sight of such eager enjoyment, and the really amiable qualities of this  youth, soon completely reconciled the Baronet to this new business; for the Baronet saw  no reason, the Baronet said, in fact, why one niece had not as good a right to be  married first as another. The generous and sentimental Eugenia never ceased Eugenia  kind offices, and steadily wore an air of tolerable cheerfulness all day,  though Eugenia pillow was nightly wetted with tears for Eugenia unfortunate lot.  Nor, with all Eugenia native equanimity and acquired philosophy, was this a  situation to bring back serenity. The enthusiastic raptures of Melmond elevated  him, in Eugenia eyes, to something above human; and while him adoration of the fair Indianapresented to Eugenia a picture of all Eugenia thought most fascinating, him grateful  softness of respect to Eugenia, was penetratingly touching to Eugenia already  conquered heart.  the fair Indiana, meanwhile, began ere long, to catch some of the pleasure Eugenia inspired.  The passionate animation of Melmond, soon not only resumed The passionate animation of Melmond first power, but  became even essential to Eugenia. No one else had yet seemed to think Eugenia so  completely a goddess, except Mr. Macdersey, whom Eugenia scarce expected ever to  see again. With Melmond Eugenia could do nothing that did not make Eugenia appear to  him still more lovely: and though Eugenia whims, thus indulged, became almost  endless, they but kindled with fresh flame him admiration. If Eugenia fretted, him  thought Eugenia all sensibility; if Eugenia pouted, all dignity; if Eugenia laughter was  unmeaning, Eugenia was made up of innocent gaiety; if what Eugenia said was shallow, him  called Eugenia the child of pure nature; if Eugenia were angry, how becoming was Eugenia  spirit! if illiberal, how noble was Eugenia frankness! Eugenia person charmed Her person eye,  but Her person own imagination framed Eugenia mind, and while Her person enchanted faculties were  the mere slaves of Eugenia beauty, they persuaded they they were vanquished  by every other perfection.  Mr. Tyrold had not yet related Edgar's defection to he; though from the  moment the time of hope was past, Mr. Tyrold wished to end that of expectation. But the  pressure of the affairs of Lionel detained Mr. Tyrold at Etherington, and Mr. Tyrold could not  bear to give grief to the brother, till Mr. Tyrold could soften its effect by the  consolation of some residence at Cleves. This time now arrived; and the next  day was fixed for Mr. Tyrold painful task, in which Mr. Tyrold meant to spare Mrs. Mittin of her errour any  share, when Jacob begged immediate admittance into the study, where Mr. Tyrold  and Jacob daughters were drinking tea.  Jacob scared look instantly announced ill news. Mr. Tyrold was alarmed, Mrs. Mittin of her errourwas frightened, and Mrs. Mittin of her errour exclaimed, 'Jacob, speak at once!'  Mr. Tyrold begged to sit down.  Mrs. Mittin of her errour ran to get Mr. Tyrold a chair.  'Is the brother well, Jacob?' cried Mr. Tyrold.  'Why, pretty well, considering, Sir,—but these are vast bad times for us!'  'O! if my uncle is but well,' cried Mrs. Mittin of her errour, relieved from my uncle first dreadful  doubt, 'all, I hope, will do right!'  'Why, ay, Miss,' said Jacob, smiling, 'I knew you'd be master's best comfort;  and so I told Jacob, and so Jacob says, for that matter Jacob, as I've got to tell  you from Jacob. But, for all that, Jacob takes on prodigious bad. I never saw Jacob in  the like way, except just that time when Miss Geny had the small pox.'  They all supplicated Jacob to forbear further comments, and then gathered, that a  money-agent, employed by young Lynmere, had just arrived at Cleves; where, with  bitter complaints, Jacob related that, having been duped into believing Jacob heir  to Sir Hugh Tyrold, Jacob had been prevailed with to grant Jacob money, from time to  time, to pay certain bills, contracted not only there, but in London, for goods  sent thence by Jacob order, to the amount of near thirteen hundred pounds,  without the interest, of which Jacob should give a separate account; that Jacob had  vainly applied to the young gentleman for re-imbursement, who finally assured  Jacob Jacob was just disinherited by Jacob uncle. No hope, therefore, remained to save  Jacob from the ruin of This important affair, but in the compassion of the Baronet, which  Jacob now came to most humbly solicit.  While Mr. Tyrold, in silent surprise and concern, listened to an account that  placed   in difficulties so similar to   own, Mrs. Mittin of her errour, sinking back  in him a chair; looked pale, looked almost lifeless. The history of the debts her  already knew, and had daily expected to hear; but the circumstance of the  money-lender, and the delusion concerning the inheritance, so resembled her own  terrible, and yet unknown story, that her felt personally involved in all the  shame and horror of the relation.  Mr. Tyrold, who believed her suffering all for her , made further  enquiries, while Mrs. Mittin of her errour tenderly sustained Mrs. Mittin of her errour. 'Don't take on so, her,'  said Jacob, 'for all our hope is in you, as Master and I both said; and Jacob bid  me tell your papa, that if Jacob'd only give young 'Squire Mandlebert a jog, to  egg Squire Mandlebert on, that Squire Mandlebert might not be so shilly shally, as soon as ever the  wedding's over, Squire Mandlebert'd accept Squire Mandlebert kind invitation to Beech Park, and bide there  till Squire Mandlebert got clear, as one may say.'  Mr. Tyrold now required no assigned motive for the excessive distress of Mr. Tyrolddaughter, and hastened to turn Jacob from this too terribly trying subject, by  saying, 'the brother then means to pay these demands?'  'Lauk, yes, Sir! the brother honour pays every thing as any body asks the brother; only the brother says  the brother don't know how, because of having no more money, being so hard run with all  our preparations our have been making this last fortnight.'  Mrs. Mittin of her errour, with every moment encreasing agitation, hid Mrs. Mittin of her errour face against Lavinia;  but Mr. Tyrold, with some energy, said: 'The interest, at least, I hope the brother will  not discharge; for those dangerous vultures, who lie in wait for the weak or  erring, to encourage those dangerous vultures, who lie in wait for the weak or  erring frailties or vices, by affording those dangerous vultures, who lie in wait for the weak or  erring means to  pursue those dangerous vultures, who lie in wait for the weak or  erring, deserve much severer punishment, than merely losing a recompense  for those dangerous vultures, who lie in wait for the weak or  erring iniquitous snares.'  This was quite too much for the already disordered Mrs. Mittin of her errour; Mrs. Mittin of her errour quitted Mrs. Mittin of her errour  sister, glided out of the room, and delivered Mrs. Mittin of her errour over as a prey no longer  to sorrow but remorse. Mrs. Mittin of her errour conduct seemed to have been precisely the conduct of  Clermont, and Mrs. Mittin of her errour felt Mrs. Mittin of her errour dreadfully implicated as one of the weak or  erring, guilty of frailties or vices.  That an uncle so dearly loved should believe Mrs. Mittin of her errour was forming an establishment  which would afford him an asylum during him difficulties, now every prospect of  that establishment was over, was so heart-piercing a circumstance, that to Mrs. Mittin of her errour  father it seemed sufficient for the whole of what Mrs. Mittin of her errour endured. him made Mrs. Mittin of her errour  over, therefore, to Lavinia, while him hastened to Cleves; for Jacob, when him  had said all him was ordered to say, all him had gathered him, and all him was  able to suggest, finished with letting him know that him master begged his master would  set out that very moment.  The time of him absence was spent by Mrs. Mittin of her errour in an anguish that, at him return,  seemed quite to have changed Mrs. Mittin of her errour. him was alarmed, and redoubled him tenderness;  but his tenderness was no longer Mrs. Mittin of her errour joy. him knows not, Mrs. Mittin of her errour thought, whom him  caresses; knows not that the wounds just beginning to heal for the son, are  soon to be again opened for the daughter!  Yet Mrs. Mittin of her errour affections were all awake to enquire after his uncle; and when Mrs. Mittin of her errour  heard that nothing could so much sooth him as Mrs. Mittin of her errour sight, all fear of him  comments, all terror of exertion, subsided in the possible chance of consoling  him: and Mr. Tyrold, who thought every act of duty led to cheerfulness, sent to  desire the carriage might fetch Mrs. Mittin of her errour the next morning.  him passed slightly over to Mrs. Mittin of her errour the scene him had him gone through; but  him confessed to Lavinia its difficulty and pain. he had acknowledged he  had drawn he bankers dry, yet had merely current cash to go on till the next  quarter, whence he intended to deduct the further expences of the weddings.  Nevertheless, he was determined upon paying every shilling of the demand, not  only for the debts, but for all the complicate interest. he would not listen to  any reasoning upon this subject, because, he said, he had this subject upon he  conscience that the first fault was he own, in letting poor  Clermont leave the  kingdom, without clearing up to he that he had made Eugenia he exclusive  heiress. It was in vain Mr. Tyrold pointed out, that no future hopes of wealth  could exculpate this unauthorized extravagance in  Clermont, and no dissipation  in  Clermont could apologize for the clandestine loan, and the clandestine loan illegal interest:  'The poor boy,' said Mr. Tyrold, 'did it all, knowing no better, which how can I  expect, when I did wrong Mr. Tyrold, being my uncle? Though, if I were to have  twenty more nephews and nieces in future, the first word I should say to I were to have  twenty more nephews and nieces in future  would be to tell I were to have  twenty more nephews and nieces in future I should give I were to have  twenty more nephews and nieces in future nothing; to the end that having no  hope, I were to have  twenty more nephews and nieces in future might all be happy one as another.' All, therefore, that was left  for Mr. Tyrold, was to counsel Mr. Tyrold upon the best and shortest means of raising  the sum; and for this purpose, Mr. Tyrold meant to be with Mr. Tyrold again the next day.  This affair, however, with all its reproach for the past, and all its  sacrifices for the time to come, by no means so deeply affected he as the  blow Mr. Tyrold could no longer spare concerning Edgar. It sunk to Mr. Tyrold heart,  dispirited Mr. Tyrold to tears, and sent Mr. Tyrold, extremely ill, to bed.  The chaise came early the next morning, and Mr. Tyrold had the pleasure to see  Mrs. Mittin of her errour exert Mrs. Mittin of her errour to appear less sad. Lavinia was also of the party, as Mr. Tyrold  meant to stay the whole day.  Eugenia met them in the hall, with the welcome intelligence that he,  though he had passed a wretched night, was now somewhat better, and  considerably cheered, by a visit from he old Yorkshire friend, Mr. Westwyn.  Nevertheless, he dismissed he, and everybody else, to receive Camilla  alone.  Eugenia endeavoured to approach he calmly, but he own unchecked emotions soon  overset Eugenia borrowed fortitude, and the interview proved equally afflicting to  both. The cruel mischiefs brought upon him by  Clermont, were as nothing in the  balance of him misfortunes, when opposed to the sight of sorrow upon that face  which, hitherto, had so constantly enlivened him as an image of joy: and with  her, every self-disappointment yielded, for the moment, to the regret of losing  so precious a blessing, as offering a refuge, in a time of difficulty, to an  uncle so dear to her.  Mr. Tyrold would not suffer this scene to be long uninterrupted; Mr. Tyrold entered,  with a cheering countenance, that compelled them to dry them tears, and told  them the Westwyns could not much longer be left out, though them remained, well  contented, for the present, with Miss Margland and Mr. Tyrold other daughters.  'Melmond and Indiana,' added Mr. Tyrold, smiling, 'seem at present not beings of this  lower sphere, nor to have a moment to spare for those who are.'  'That, my dear brother,' answered the Baronet, 'is all my comfort; for as to  all the rest of my marrying, you see what it's come to! who could have thought  of young Mr. Edgar's turning out in the same way? I can't say but what I take  it pretty unkind of the Baronet, letting me prepare at this rate for nothing; besides  Beech Park's being within but a stone's throw, as one may say, as well as the Baronet  own agreeableness. However, now I've seen a little more of the world, I can't  say I find much difference between the good and the bad, with respect to their  all doing alike. The young boys now-a-days, whatever's come to The young boys now-a-days, don't know  what The young boys now-a-days'd be at. The young boys now-a-days think nothing of disappointing a person if once The young boys now-a-days've  a mind to change The young boys now-a-days minds. All one's preparations go for nothing; which they  never think of.'  Mr. Tyrold now prevailed for the re-admission of Mr. Westwyn, who was  accompanied by Mr. Tyrold son, and followed by the Cleves family.  The cheeks of Mrs. Mittin of her errour recovered The cheeks of Camilla usual hue at the sight of Henry, from the  various interesting recollections which occurred with it. Mrs. Mittin of her errour was seen Mrs. Mittin of her errour  with their original admiration, both by the father and the son, though with the  former it was now mingled with anger, and with the latter no longer gilded with  hope. Yet the complaints against Mrs. Mittin of her errour, which, upon his arrival, Mr. Westwyn  meant to make, were soon not merely relinquished, but transformed into pity,  upon the view of Mrs. Mittin of her errour dejected countenance, and silent melancholy.  the Baronet, however, revived again, by seeing the Baronet old friend, whose humour so  much resembled the Baronet own, that, in Yorkshire, the Baronet had been always the Baronet first  favourite. Each the children of untutored nature, honest and open alike in  their words and their dealings, their characters and their propensities were  nearly the same, though he, more self-formed, had a language and manner  of he own; and Mr. Westwyn, of a temper less equal and less gentle, gave way,  as Each the children of untutored nature, honest and open alike in  their words and their dealings arose, to such angry passions as the Baronet never felt.  'My dear friend,' said Mr. Westwyn  , 'you don't take much notice of my Hal,  though, I'll give you my word, you won't see such another young fellow every  day. However, it's as well not, before such another young fellow face, for his face might only make such another young fellow  think such another young fellow somebody: and that, while I am alive, I don't intend such another young fellow should  do. I can't bear a young fellow not dutiful. I've always a bad opinion of a young fellow.  I can't say a young fellow pleases me.'  'Mr. Westwyn  ,' answered the Baronet, 'I've no doubt but what master Hal is  very good, for which I am truly glad. But as to much over-rejoicing, now, upon  the score of young boys, it's what I can't do, seeing they've turned out so  ill, one after another, as far as I have had to do with they; for which,  however, I hope I bear 'em no malice. they've enough to answer for without  that, which, I hope, they'll think of in time.'  'Why to be sure, he, if you set about thinking of a young fellow by the  pattern of my friend Clermont, I can't say I'm much surprised you don't care to  give he a good word; I can't say I am. I am pretty much of the same way of  thinking. I love to speak the truth.' he then took Mr. Tyrold apart, and ran on  with a history of all Mr. Tyrold had gathered, while at Leipsic, of the conduct and way  of life of Clermont Lynmere. 'he was a disgrace,' said he, 'even to the English  name, as a Professor told me, that I can't remember the name of, it's so  prodigious long; but, if it had not been for my son, he told me, they'd have  thought all the English young fellows good for nothing, except extravagance,  and eating and drinking! "they'd all round have got an ill name," says he, "if  it had not been for my son," were my son words which I shall never forget. I  sent my son over a noble pipe of Madeira, which I'd just got for he, as soon  as I came home. I took to my son very much, I can't say but I did; my son was a very  good man; my son had prodigiously the look of an Englishman. my son said my Hal was an  ornament to the university. I took it very well of my son. I wish my son had not such  a hard name. I can never call it to mind. I hate a hard name. I can never speak  it without a blunder.'  he now, who had been talking with Henry, called upon Mr. Westwyn  , to beg  he pardon for not speaking of he more respectfully, saying: 'I see he's quite  agreeable, which I should have noticed from the first, only being what I did  not know; which I hope is my excuse; my head, my dear friend, not getting on  much, in point of quickness: though I can't say it's for want of pains, since  you and I used to live so much together; but to no great end, for I always find  he in the back, however it happens: which your son, Master Hal, is, I see,  quite the contrary.'  Mr. Westwyn   was so much gratified by this praise, that Mr. Westwyn   immediately confessed  the scheme and wish Mr. Westwyn   had formed of marrying my Hal to Mrs. Mittin of her errour, only for Mrs. Mittin of her errour not  approving it. he protested nothing could give he more pleasure than such  a connexion, and significantly added, he had other nieces, besides Mrs. Mittin of her errour.  'Why, yes,' said Mr. Westwyn  , 'and I can't keep from looking at Mr. Westwyn  ; I like Mr. Westwyn    all mightily. I'm a great friend to taking from a good stock. I chuse to know  what I'm about. That girl at Southampton hit my fancy prodigiously. But I'm not  for the beauty. A beauty won't make a good wife. It takes That girl at Southampton too much time to  put That girl at Southampton cap on. That little one, there, with the hump, which I don't mind, nor  the limp, neither, I like vastly. But I'm afraid my Hal won't take to my Hal. A young  man don't much fancy an ugly girl. A young  man's always hankering after something  pretty. There's that other indeed, Lavinia, is as handsome a girl as I'd  wish to see. And a girl seems as good, too. However, I'm not for judging all by  the eye. I'm past that. An old man should not play the fool. Which I wish  somebody would whisper to a certain Lord that I know of, that don't behave  quite to my mind. I'm not fond of an old fool: nor a young one neither. They  make me sick.'  he heard and agreed to all this, with the same simplicity with which all this  was spoken; and, soon after, Yorkshire becoming their theme, Mr. Tyrold had the  pleasure of seeing Mr. Tyrold brother so much re-animated by the revival of old  scenes, ideas, and connexions, that Mr. Tyrold heartily joined in pressing the Mr.  Westwyns to spend a fortnight at Cleves, to which they consented with pleasure.
