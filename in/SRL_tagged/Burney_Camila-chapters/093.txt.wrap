 Juvenile Calculations  Mrs. Norfield, a lady whom circumstances had brought into some intimacy with  Mrs. Berlinton upon her marriage, had endeavoured, from the first of her  entrance into high life, to draw her into a love of play; not with an idea of  doing her any mischief, for she was no more her enemy than her friend; but to  answer her own purposes of having a Faro table under her own direction. She was  a woman of fashion, and as such every-where received; but her fortune was  small, and her passion for gaming inordinate; and as there was not, at this  time, one Faro table at Southampton, whither she was ordered for her health,  she was almost wearied into a lethargy, till her reiterated intreaties  prevailed, at length, with Mrs. Berlinton to hold one at her own house.  The fatigue of life without view, the peril of talents without prudence, and  the satiety of pleasure without intermission, were already dangerously  assaulting the early independence and the moment of vacancy and weariness was  seized by Mrs. Norfield, to press the essay of a new mode of amusement.  Mrs. Berlinton's house opened, failed not to be filled; and opened for a Faro  table, to be filled with a peculiar set. To game has, unfortunately, always its  attractions; to game with a perfect novice is not what will render it less  alluring; and to see that novice rich and beautiful is still less likely to be  repelling.  Mr. Berlinton, when he made this marriage, supposed he had engaged for life a  fair nurse to his infirmities; but when he saw her fixed aversion, he had not  spirit to cope with it; and when she had always an excuse for a separation, he  had not the sense to acquaint himself how she passed her time in his absence. A  natural imbecility of mind was now nearly verging upon dotage, and as he rarely  quitted his room but at meal times, she made a point never to see him in any  other part of the day. Her antipathy rendered her obdurate, though her  disposition was gentle, and she had now left him at Tunbridge, to meet her aunt  at Southampton, with a knowledge he was too ill to follow her, and a  determination, upon various pretences, to stay away from him for some months.  The ill fate of such unequal alliances is almost daily exemplified in life; and  though few young brides of old bridegrooms fly their mates thus openly and  decidedly, their retainers have seldom much cause to rejoice in superior  happiness, since they are generally regarded but as the gaolers of their young  prey.  Moderation was the last praise to which Mrs. Berlinton had any claim; what she  entered upon through persecution, in an interval of mental supineness, she was  soon awake to as a pleasure, and next pursued as a passion. Her beloved  correspondent was neglected; her favourite authors were set aside; her country  rambles were given up; balls and the rooms were forgotten; and Faro alone  engrossed her faculties by day, and her dreams during the short epoch she  reserved for sleep at night. She lost, as might be expected, as constantly as  she played; but as money was not what she naturally valued, she disdained to  weigh that circumstance; and so long as she had any to pay, resigned it with  more grace than by others it was won.  That Camilla was not caught by this ruinous fascination, was not simply the  effect of necessity. Had the state of her finances been as flourishing as it  was decayed, she would have been equally steady in this forbearance: her reason  was fair, though her feelings frequently chased it from the field. She looked  on, therefore, with safety, though not wholly with indifference; she had too  much fancy not to be amused by the spirit of the business, and was too animated  not to take part in the successive hopes and fears of the several competitors;  but though her quick sensations prompted a readiness, like that of Mrs.  Berlinton, to enter warmly into all that was presented to her, the resemblance  went no further; what she was once convinced was wrong she was incapable of  practising.  Upon Gaming, the first feeling and the latest reflection are commonly one; both  point its hazards to be unnecessary, its purposes rapacious, and its end  desperate loss, or destructive gain; she not only, therefore, held back; she  took the liberty, upon the privilege of their avowed friendship, to remonstrate  against this dangerous pastime with Mrs. Berlinton. But that lady, though  eminently designed to be amiable, had now contracted the fearful habit of  giving way to every propensity; and finding her native notions of happiness  were blighted in the bud, concluded that all which now remained for her was the  indulgence of every luxury. She heard with sweetness the expostulation of her  young friend; but she pursued her own course.  In a very few days, however, while the blush of shame dyed her beautiful  cheeks, she inquired if Camilla could lend her a little ready money.  A blush of no less unpleasant feelings overspread the face of her fair guest,  in being compelled to own she had none to lend; but she eagerly promised to  procure some from Mrs. Mittin, who had a note in her hand to exchange for the  payment of some small debts contracted at Tunbridge. Mrs. Berlinton, gathering,  from her confusion, how ill she was stored, would not hear of applying to this  resource, 'though I hate,' she cried, 'to be indebted to that odious old  cousin, of whom I was obliged to borrow last night.'  Glaring imprudence in others is a lesson even to the most unthinking; Camilla,  when she found that Mrs. Berlinton had lost every guinea she could command,  ventured to renew still more forcibly her exhortations against the Faro table;  but Mrs. Berlinton, notwithstanding she possessed an excellent capacity, was so  little fortified with any practical tenets either of religion or morality, that  where sentiment did not take the part of what was right, she had no  preservative against what was wrong. The Faro table, therefore, was still  opened; and Lord Valhurst, by the sums he lent, obtained every privilege of  intimacy in the family, except that of being welcome.  Against this perilous mode of proceeding Camilla was not the only warner. Mrs.  Ulst saw with extreme repugnance the mode of life her niece was pursuing, and  reprimanded her with severe reproach; but her influence was now lost; and Mrs.  Berlinton, though she kindly attended her, and sought to alleviate her  sufferings, acted as if she were not in existence.  It was now Mrs. Mittin gained the highest point of her ambition; Mrs.  Berlinton, tired of remonstrances she could not controvert, and would not  observe, was extremely relieved by finding a person who would sit with her  aunt, comply with her humours, hear her lamentations, subscribe to her  opinions, and beguile her of her rigid fretfulness by the amusement of  gossiping anecdotes.  Mrs. Mittin had begun life as the apprentice to a small country milliner; but  had rendered herself so useful to a sick elderly gentlewoman, who lodged in the  house, that she left her a legacy, which, by sinking into an annuity, enabled  her to quit her business, and set up, in her own conception, for a gentlewoman  herself; though with so very small an income, that to sustain her new post, she  was frequently reduced to far greater dependence and hardships than she  experienced in her old one. She was good-humoured, yet laborious; gay, yet  subservient; poor, yet dissipated. To be useful, she would submit to any  drudgery; to become agreeable, devoted herself to any flattery. To please was  her incessant desire, and her rage for popularity included every rank and class  of society. The more eminent, of course, were her first objects, but the same  aim descended to the lowest. She would work, read, go of errands, or cook a  dinner; be a parasite, a spy, an attendant, a drudge; keep a secret, or spread  a report; incite a quarrel, or coax contending parties into peace; invent any  expedient, and execute any scheme ... all with the pretext to oblige others,  but all, in fact, for simple egotism; as prevalent in her mind as in that of  the more highly ambitious, though meaner and less dangerous.  Camilla was much relieved when she found this officious person was no longer  retained solely upon her account; but still she could neither obtain her bills,  no answers ever arriving, nor the money for her twenty pound note, Mrs. Mittin  always evading to deliver it, and asserting she was sure somebody would come in  the stage the next day for the payment she had promised; and when Camilla  wanted cash for any of the very few articles she now allowed herself to think  indispensable, instead of restoring it into her hands, she flew out herself to  purchase the goods that were required, and always brought them home with  assurances they were cheaper than the shopkeepers would let her have them for  herself.  Camilla resisted all incitements to new dress and new ornaments, with a  fortitude which must not be judged by the aged, nor the retired, who weighing  only the frivolity of what she withstood, are not qualified to appreciate the  merit of this sort of resignation; the young, the gay, the new in life, who  know that, amongst minor calamities, none are more alarming to the juvenile  breast than the fear of not appearing initiated in the reigning modes, can  alone do justice to the present philosophy of Camilla, in seeing that all she  wore, by the quick changes of fashion, seemed already out of date; in refusing  to look at the perpetual diversity of apparel daily brought, by various dress  modellers, for the approbation of Mrs. Berlinton, and in seeing that lady  always newly, brightly, and in a distinguished manner attired, yet appearing by  her side in exactly the same array that she had constantly worn at Tunbridge.  Nor was Camilla indifferent to this contrast; but she submitted to it as the  duty of her present involved situation, which exacted from her every privation,  in preference to bestowing upon any new expence the only sum she could command  towards clearing what was past.  But, after a very short time, the little wardrobe exhibited a worse quality  than that of not keeping pace with the last devices of the ton; it lost not  merely its newness, but its delicacy. Alas! thought she, how long, in the  careful and rare wear of Etherington and Cleves, all this would have served me;  while here, in this daily use, a fortnight is scarce passed, yet all is spoilt  and destroyed. Ah! public places are only for the rich!  Now, therefore, Mrs. Mittin was of serious utility; she failed not to observe  the declining state of her attire; and though she wondered at the parsimony  which so resolutely prohibited all orders for its renewal, in a young lady she  considered as so great an heiress, she was yet proud to display her various  powers of proving serviceable. She turned, changed, rubbed, cleaned, and new  made up all the several articles of which her dress was composed, to so much  advantage, and with such striking effect, that for yet a few days more all  seemed renewed, and by the arts of some few alterations, her appearance was  rather more than less fashionable than upon her first arrival.  But this could not last long; and when all, again, was fading into a state of  decay, Mrs. Berlinton received an invitation for herself and her fair guest, to  a great ball and supper, given upon the occasion of a young nobleman's coming  of age, in which all the dancers, by agreement, were to be habited in uniform.  This uniform was to be clear fine lawn, with lilac plumes and ornaments.  Camilla had now, with consuming regret, passed several days without one sight  of Edgar. This invitation, therefore, which was general to all the company at  Southampton, was, in its first sound, delicious; but became, upon  consideration, the reverse. Clear lawn and lilac plumes and ornaments she had  none; how to go she knew not; yet Edgar she was sure would be there; how to  stay away she knew less.  This was a severe moment to her courage; she felt it faltering, and putting  down the card of invitation, without the force of desiring Mrs. Berlinton to  make her excuse, repaired to her own room, terrified by the preponderance of  her wishes to a consent which she knew her situation rendered unwarrantable.  There, however, though she gained time for reflection, she gathered not the  resolution she sought. The stay at Southampton, by the desire of Lynmere, had  been lengthened; yet only a week now remained, before she must return to her  father and her uncle ... but how return? separated from Edgar? Edgar whom she  still believed she had only to see again in some more auspicious moment, to  re-conquer and fix for life! But when and where might that auspicious moment be  looked for? not at Mrs. Berlinton's; there he no more attempted to visit: not  at the Rooms; those now were decidedly relinquished, and all general  invitations were inadequate to draw Mrs. Berlinton from her new pursuit: where,  then, was this happy explanation to pass?  When our wishes can only be gratified with difficulty, we conclude, in the  ardour of combating their obstacle, that to lose them, is to lose everything,  to obtain them is to ensure all good. At this ball, and this supper, Camilla  painted Edgar completely restored to her; she was certain he would dance with  her; she was sure he would sit by no one else during the repast; the many days  since they had met would endear to him every moment they could now spend  together, and her active imagination soon worked up scenes so important from  this evening, that she next persuaded her belief that all chance of  reconciliation hung wholly upon the meeting it offered.  Impelled by this notion, yet wavering, dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, she  summoned Mrs. Mittin, and entreated she would make such inquiries concerning  the value of the ball-dress uniform, as would enable her to estimate its entire  expence.  Her hours passed now in extreme disquietude; for while all her hopes centred in  the approaching festival, the estimate which was to determine her power of  enjoying it was by no means easy to procure. Mrs. Mittin, though an adept in  such matters, took more pleasure in the parade than in the performance of her  task; and always answered to her inquiries, that it was impossible to speak so  soon; that she must go to such another shop first; that she must consult with  such and such a person; and that she must consider over more closely the orders  given by Mrs. Berlinton, which were to be her direction, though with the  stipulation of having materials much cheaper and more common.  At length, however, she burst into her room, one morning, before she was  dressed, saying: 'Now, my dear miss, I hope I shall make you happy;' and  displayed, upon the bed, a beautiful piece of fine lawn.  Camilla examined and admired it, asked what it was a yard, and how much would  suffice for the dress.  'Why, my dear, I'll answer for it there's enough for three whole dresses; why  it's a whole piece; and I dare say I can get a handkerchief and an apron out of  it into the bargain.'  'But I want neither handkerchief, nor apron, nor three dresses, Mrs. Mittin; I  shall take the smallest quantity that is possible, if I take any at all.'  Mrs. Mittin said that the man would not cut it, and she must take the whole, or  none.  Camilla was amazed she could so far have misunderstood her as to bring it upon  such terms, and begged she would carry it back.  'Nay, if you don't take this, my dear, there's nothing in the shops that comes  near it for less than fifteen shillings a-yard; Mrs. Berlinton gives eighteen  for her's, and it don't look one bit to choose; and this, if you take it all  together, you may have for ten, for all its width, for there's 30 yards, and  the piece comes to but fifteen pound.'  Camilla protested she would not, at this time, pay ten shillings a-yard for any  gown in the world.  Mrs. Mittin, who had flattered herself that the handkerchief and apron, at  least, if not one of the gowns, would have fallen to her share, was much  discomposed by this unexpected declaration; and disappointed, murmuring, and  conceiving her the most avaricious of mortals, was forced away; leaving Camilla  in complete despondence of any power to effect her wish with propriety.  Mrs. Mittin came back late, and with a look of dismay; the man of whom she had  had the muslin, who was a traveller, whom she had met at a friend's, had not  waited her return; and, as she had left the fifteen pounds with him, for a  pledge of the security of his goods, she supposed he had made off, to get rid  of the whole piece at once.  Camilla felt petrified. No possible pleasure or desire could urge her,  deliberately, to what she deemed an extravagance; yet here, in one moment, she  was despoiled of three parts of all she possessed, either for her own use, or  towards the restitution of her just debts with others.  Observing her distress, though with more displeasure than pity, from believing  it founded in the most extraordinary covetousness, Mrs. Mittin proposed  measuring the piece in three, and disposing of the two gowns she did not want  to Mrs. Berlinton, or her sister and Miss Lynmere.  Camilla was a little revived; but the respite of difficulty was short; upon  opening the piece, it was found damaged; and after the first few yards, which  Mrs. Mittin had sedulously examined, not a breadth had escaped some rent, fray,  or mischief.  The ill being now irremediable, to make up the dress in the cheapest manner  possible was the only consolation that remained. Mrs. Mittin knew a  mantua-maker who, to oblige her, would undertake this for a very small payment;  and she promised to procure everything else that was necessary for the merest  trifle.  Determined, however, to risk nothing more in such hands, she now positively  demanded that the residue of the note should be restored to her own keeping.  Mrs. Mittin, though much affronted, honestly refunded the five pounds. The  little articles she had occasionally brought were still unpaid for; but her  passion for detaining the money was merely with a view to give herself  consequence, in boasting how and by whom she was trusted, and now and then  drawing out her purse, before those who had less to produce; but wholly without  any design of imposition or fraud; all she could obtain by hints and address  she conceived to be fair booty; but further she went not even in thought.  Three days now only remained before this event-promising ball was to take  place, and within three after it, the Southampton expedition was to close.  Camilla scarce breathed from impatience for the important moment, which was  preceded by an invitation to all the company, to take a sail on the Southampton  water on the morning of the entertainment.
