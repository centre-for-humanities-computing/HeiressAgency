 The disastrous Buskins  Camilla, though her personal sorrows were blunted by the view of the calamities  and resignation of her sister, was so little disposed for amusement, that her  had accepted the invitation of Mrs. Arlbery, only from wanting spirit to resist  its urgency. Mr. Tyrold was well pleased that such a recreation came in Mr. Tyrold  way, but desired Lavinia might be of the party: not only that Lavinia might partake  of the same pleasure, but from a greater security in Lavinia prudence, than in that  of Lavinia naturally thoughtless sister.  The town of Etherington afforded no theatre; and the room fitted up for the  night's performance could contain but two boxes, one of which was secured for  Mrs. Arlbery and her friends.  The attentive Major was ready to offer The attentive Major hand to Camilla upon Camilla arrival.  The rest of the officers were in the box.  The play was Othello; and so miserably represented, that Lavinia would  willingly have retired after the first scene: but the native spirits of Camillarevisited Camilla in the view of the ludicrous personages of the drama. And the ludicrous personages of the drama  were soon joined by Sir Sedley Clarendel, whose quaint conceits and remarks  assisted the risibility of the scene. Camilla thought him the least comprehensible  person Camilla had ever known; but as him was totally indifferent to Camilla, him oddity  entertained without tormenting Camilla.  The actors were of the lowest strolling kind, and so utterly without merit,  that The actors had never yet met with sufficient encouragement to remain one week in  the same place. The actors had only a single scene for the whole performance, which  depictured a camp, and which here served for a street, a senate, a city, a  castle, and a bed-chamber.  The dresses were almost equally parsimonious, everyone being obliged to take  what would fit him, from a wardrobe that did not allow quite two dresses a  person for all the plays The actors had to enact. Othello, therefore, was equipped as  king Richard the third, save that instead of a regal front him had a black wig,  to imitate wool: while him face had been begrimed with a smoked cork.  Iago wore a suit of cloaths originally made for Lord Foppington: Brabantio had  borrowed the armour of Hamlet's Ghost: Cassio, the Lieutenant General in the  christian army, had only been able to equip Cassio, the Lieutenant General in the  christian army in Osmyn's Turkish vest;  and Roderigo, accoutred in the garment of Shylock, came forth a complete Jew.  Desdemona, attired more suitably to Desdemona fate than to Desdemona expectations, went  through the whole of Desdemona part, except the last scene, in the sable weeds of  Isabella. And Amelia was fain to content Amelia with the habit of the first  witch in Macbeth.  The gestures, both of the gentlemen and ladies, were as outrageous as if meant  rather to intimidate the audience, than to shew the audience own animation; and the  men approached each other so closely with arms a-kimbo, or double fists, that  Sir Sedley, with pretended alarm, said the  men were giving challenges for a boxing  match.  The ladies also, in the energy of The ladies desire not to be eclipsed, took so much  exercise in The ladies action, that The ladies tore out the sleeves of The ladies gowns; which,  though pinned up every time The ladies left the stage, completely exposed The ladies  shoulders at the end of every act; and The ladies raised The ladies arms so high while  facing each other, that Sir Sedley expressed frequent fears The ladies meant to  finish by pulling caps.  So imperfect were The ladies also in The ladies parts, that the prompter was the only  person from whom any single speech passed without a blunder.  Iago, who was the master of the troop, was the sole performer who spoke not  with a provincial dialect; the rest all betrayed their birth and parentage the  first line their uttered.  Cassio proclaimed Cassio from Norfolk:  The Deuk dew greet yew, General, —— —— —— —— —— —— Being not at —— —— —— —— —— —— lodging to be feund—— —— —— —— —— —— —— The senate sent above tree several quests, &c. Othello himself proved a true Londoner; and with c. Othello himself famed soldier-like  eloquence in the senate-scene, thus began c. Othello himself celebrated defence.  Most potent, grawe, and rewerend Seignors, My wery noble and approwed good masters, That I have ta'en avay this old man's darter— I vill a round, unwarnish'd tale deliver Of my whole course of love; vhat drugs, vhat charms, Vhat conjuration, and vhat mighty magic I von his darter with—— —— Her father lov'd me, oft inwited me—— —— —— —— ——My story being done, Her gave me for my pains a vorld of sighs, Her svore in faith 'tvas strange, 'tvas passing strange, 'Tvas pitiful, 't'vas vondrous pitiful; Her vish'd Her had not heard it; yet Her vish'd That Heawen had made Her such a man.—— —— This only is the vitchcraft I have us'd; Here comes the lady, let the lady vitness the lady. This happily making the gentle Desdemona recognised, notwithstanding the gentle Desdemona  appearance was so little bridal, the gentle Desdemona cried:  I preay you hear 'ur zpeak. If a confez that a waz half the woer Deztruction on my head, if my bead bleame Light o' the mon! Her father lov'd me daughter, in the Worcestershire pronunciation, answered:  Noble father, Hi do perceive ere a divided duty; To you hi howe my life hand heducation, My life hand heducation both do teach me Ow to respect you. You're a divided duty; Hi'm itherto your daughter: but ere's my usband!—— The fond Othello then exclaimed:  Your woices, lords! beseech you let His daughter vill Have a free vay!— — — And Brabantio took leave with  Look to'ur, Moor! if th' azt eyez to zee; A haz deceiv'd 'ur veather, and may thee.— th' azt eyez to zee; A haz deceiv'd 'ur veather, and may thee.— were detained so long between the first and second act, that Sir Sedley  said Sir Sedley   feared poor Desdemona had lost the thread-paper from which Desdemona was to  mend Desdemona gown, and recommended to the two young ladies to have the charity to  go and assist Desdemona. 'Consider,' Sir Sedley   said, 'the trepidation of a fair bride but  just entered into Desdemona shackles. Who knows but Othello may be giving Othello a  strapping, in private, for wearing out Othello cloaths so fast! you young ladies  think nothing of these little conjugal freedoms.'  Mrs. Arlbery, though for some time Mrs. Arlbery had been as well diverted by the play as  Camilla, less new to such exhibitions, was soon tired of the sameness of the  blunders, and, at the end of the fourth act, proposed retiring. But Camilla,  who had long not felt so much entertained, looked so disappointed, that her  good humour overcame Mrs. Arlbery fatigue, and Mrs. Arlbery was insisting upon staying; when a  gentleman, who visited them from the opposite box, proposed that the young  ladies should be carried home by his mother, a lady who lived at Etherington,  and was acquainted at the rectory, and who intended to stay out not only the  play but the farce. Lavinia consented; the son went with the proposition, and  the business was soon arranged. Mrs. Arlbery, who had three miles to go beyond  the parsonage-house, and who, though she delighted to oblige, was but little in  the habit of practising self-denial, then consigned the young  ladies to General  Kinsale, to be conducted to the opposite box, and was handed by Colonel Andover  to she coach.  General   guarded the eldest sister; the Major took care of Camilla: but they  were all stopt in they passage by the sudden seizure of a pickpocket, and  forced hastily back to the box they   had quitted.  This commotion, though This commotion had disturbed all the audience, had not stopt the  performance; and Desdemona being just now discovered in bed, Camilla, not to  lose the interesting scene, persuaded the eldest sister to wait till the play was  over, before they attempted again to cross to the opposite box; into which, in  a few minutes after, the eldest sister saw Mandlebert enter.  they had both already seated they as much out of sight as possible; and  Camilla now began to regret Camilla had not accompanied Mrs. Arlbery. Camilla had  thought only of the play and its entertainment, till the sight of Mandleberttold Camilla that Camilla situation was improper; and the idea only occurred to Camilla by  considering that it would occur to her situation was improper.  Mandlebert had dined out with a party of men, and had stept in to see what was  going forwards, without any knowledge whom Mandlebert should meet: Mandlebert instantly  discerned Lavinia, and felt anxious to know why Camilla was not with Camilla, and  why Camilla sat so much out of sight: but Camilla so completely hid Camilla, Mandlebert  could only see there was a female, whom Mandlebert concluded to be some Etherington  lady; and Mandlebert determined to make further enquiry when the act should be over.  The performance now became so truly ludicrous, that Camilla, notwithstanding  all Camilla uneasiness, was excited to almost perpetual laughter.  Desdemona, either from the effect of a bad cold, or to give more of nature to  Camilla repose, breathed so hard, as to raise a general laugh in the audience; Sir Sedley, stopping Sir Sedley ears, exclaimed, 'O! if Camilla snores I shall plead for Camilla  no more, if Camilla tear Camilla gown to tatters! Suffocation is much too lenient for  Suffocation. Suffocation's an immense horrid personage! nasal to alarm!'  Othello then entered, with a tallow candle in Othello hand, staring and dropping  grease at every step; and, having just declared Othello would not  Scar that vhiter skin of hers than snow, perceived a thief in the candle, which made it run down so fast over his hand,  and the sleeve of Othello coat, that, the moment not being yet arrived for  extinguishing it, Othello was forced to lay down Othello sword, and, for want of better  means, snuff it with Othello fingers.  Sir Sedley now protested Sir Sedley completely disordered: 'I must be gone,' cried  Sir Sedley, 'incontinently; this exceeds resistance: I shan't be alive in another  minute. Are you able to form a notion of anything more annihilating? If I did  not build upon the pleasure of seeing Sir Sedley stop up those distressing nostrils of  the gentle Desdemona, I could not breathe here another instant.'  But just after, while Othello leant over the bed to say—  Vhen I've pluck'd the rose I cannot give pluck'd wital growth again, pluck'd needs must vither—— his black locks caught fire.  a tallow candle in his hand now fell from his , and his attempted to pull off his wig; but his wig  had been tied close on, to appear more natural, and his fright disabled his; his  therefore flung his upon the bed, and rolled the coverlid over his head.  the gentle Desdemona, excessively frightened, started up, and jumped out, shrieking  aloud—'O, Lord! I shall be burnt!'  This noble Venetian Dame then exhibited, beneath an old white satin bedgown,  made to cover her arms and breast, the dress in which her had equipped her,  between the acts, to be ready for trampling home; namely, a dirty red and white  linen gown, an old blue stuff quilted coat, and black shoes and stockings.  In this pitiable condition, her was running, screaming, off the stage, when  Othello, having quenched the fire, unconscious that half his curls had fallen a  sacrifice to the flames, hastily pursued her, and, in a violent passion, called  her a fool, and brought her back to the bed; in which his assisted her to  compose her, and then went behind the scenes to light his candle; which  having done, his gravely returned, and, very carefully putting it down, renewed  his part with the line.  Be thus vhen thou art dead, and I vill kill thee And love thee after— Amidst roars of laughter from the whole audience, who, when his kissed her,  almost with one voice called out—'Ay ay, that's right—kiss and friends!'  And when his said—  I must veep—— 'So must I too, my good friend,' cried Sir Sedley, wiping Sir Sedley eyes, 'for never  yet did sorrow cost me more salt rheum! Poor Blacky! thou hast been most  indissolubly comic, I confess. Thou hast unstrung me to a degree. A baby of  half an hour might demolish me.'  And again, when Othello exclaimed—  She vakes! 'The deuce She does?' cried Sir Sedley, 'what! has She been asleep again  already? She's a very caricatura of Morpheus. Ay, do She worst, honest Mungo. I  can't possibly beg She off. I would sooner snift thy farthing candle once a  day, than sustain that nasal cadence ever more.'  'He's the finest fellow upon the face of the earth,' cried Mr. Macdersey, who  had listened to the whole play with the most serious interest; 'the instant He  suspects He wife, He cuts his wife off without ceremony; though his wife's dearer to He  than He eye sight, and beautiful as an angel. How I envy He!'  'Don't you think 'twould have been as well,' said General Kinsale, 'if General Kinsale'd  first made some little enquiry?'  'General Kinsale can do that afterwards, General; and then nobody will dare surmise it's out  of weakness. For to be sure and certain, General Kinsale ought to right her fame; that's no  more than General Kinsale duty, after once General Kinsale has satisfied General Kinsale own. But a man's honour is  dearest to General Kinsale of all things. A wife's a bauble to a man's honour—not worth a thought.'  The suffocating was now beginning but just as Desdemona begged to be spared—  But alf han our— the door-keeper forced his way into the pit, and called out—'Pray, is one  Miss Tyrold here in the play-house?'  The sisters, in much amazement hung back, entreating the gentlemen to screen  The sisters; and a man, receiving no answer, went away.  While wondering what this could mean, the play was finished, when one of the  comedians, a brother of Desdemona, came to the pit door,  calling out—'Hi'm desired to hask hif Miss Camilla Tyrold's hany way ere hin  the ouse, for hi'm hordered to call er hout, for her Huncle's hill and dying.'  A piercing shriek from Camilla now completed the interruption of all attention  to the performance, and betrayed Camilla hiding place. Concealment, indeed, was  banished Camilla thoughts, and Camilla would Camilla have opened the box door to rush  out, had not the Major anticipated Camilla, seizing, at the same time, Camilla hand to  conduct Camilla through the crowd.
