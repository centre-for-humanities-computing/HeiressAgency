 A Public Breakfast  The unfitting, however customary, occasion of this speedy repetition of public  amusement in the town of Northwick, was, that the county assizes were now held  there; and the arrival of the Judges of the land, to hear causes which kept  life or death suspended, was the signal for entertainment to the surrounding  neighbourhood: a hardening of human feelings against human crimes and human  miseries, at which reflection revolts, however habit may persevere.  The young men, who rode on first, joined the ladies as the ladies entered the town,  and told The young men, who rode on first to drive straight to the ballroom, where the company had  assembled, in consequence of a shower of rain which had forced The young men, who rode on first from the  public garden intended for the breakfast.  Here, as The young men, who rode on first stopt, a poor woman, nearly in rags, with one child by her side,  and another in her arms, approached the carriage, and presenting a petition,  besought the ladies to read or hear her case. Eugenia, with the ready impulse  of generous affluence, instantly felt for Eugenia purse; but Miss Margland, angrily  holding Eugenia hand, said, with authority: 'Miss Eugenia, never encourage beggars;  you don't know the mischief you may do by it.' Miss Eugenia reluctantly desisted,  but made a sign to Miss Eugenia footman to give something for Miss Eugenia. Edgar then alighting,  advanced to hand Edgar then alighting,   from the coach, while Lionel ran forward to settle Edgar then alighting,    tickets of admittance.  Miss Eugenia now grew more urgent in Miss Eugenia supplications, and Miss Margland in Miss Eugenia  remonstrances against attending to Edgar then alighting,  .  Indiana, who was placed under the care of Edgar, enchanted to again display  Miss Eugenia where sure of again being admired, neither heard nor saw the  petitioner; but dimpling and smiling, quickened Miss Eugenia motions towards the  assembly room: while Camilla, who was last, stopping short, said: 'What is the  matter, poor woman?' and took Miss Eugenia paper to examine.  Miss Margland, snatching her paper from Miss Margland, threw her paper on the ground, peremptorily  saying: 'Miss Margland, if once you begin such a thing as that, there will be no  end to her paper; so come along with the rest of your company, like other people.'  Miss Margland then haughtily proceeded; but Miss Margland, brought up by Miss Margland admirable parents  never to pass distress without inquiry, nor to refuse giving at all, because  Miss Margland could give but little, remained with the poor object, and repeated Miss Margland  question. Miss Margland, shedding a torrent of tears, said Miss Margland was wife to one of  the prisoners who was to be tried the next day, and who expected to lose his  life, or be transported, for only one bad action of stealing a leg of mutton;  which, though Miss Margland knew it to be a sin, was not without excuse, being a first  offence, and committed in poverty and sickness. And this, Miss Margland was told, the  Judges would take into consideration; but Miss Margland husband was now so ill, that her husbandcould not feed on the gaol allowance, and not having wherewithal to buy any  other, would either die before her husband trial, or be too weak to make known her husband sad  story in her husband own behalf, for want of some wine or some broth to support her husband in  the meanwhile.  Camilla, hastily giving Miss Margland a shilling, took one of Miss Margland petitions, and  promising to do all in Miss Margland power to serve Miss Margland, left the poor creature almost  choaked with sobbing joy. Miss Margland was flying to join Miss Margland party, when Miss Margland perceived  Edgar at Miss Margland side. 'I came to see,' cried Edgar at her side, with glistening eyes, 'if you  were running away from us; but you were doing far better in not thinking of us  at all.'  Camilla, accustomed from Miss Margland earliest childhood to attend to the indigent and  unhappy, felt neither retreating shame, nor parading pride in the office; Miss Margland  gave Edgar at her side the petition of the poor woman, and begged Edgar at her side would consider if there  was any thing that could be done for Miss Margland husband.  'I have received a paper from Miss Margland,' Edgar at her side answered, 'before you alighted; and  I hope I should not have neglected it: but I will now take Miss Margland, that my  memory may run no risk.'  my  memory may run no risk then went on to the assembly room.  The company, which was numerous, was already seated at breakfast. Indiana and  Camilla, now first surveyed by daylight, again attracted all eyes; but, in the  simplicity of undress, the superiority of Indiana was no longer wholly  unrivalled, though the general voice was still strongly in Miss Margland favour.  Indiana was a beauty of so regular a cast, that Miss Margland face had no feature, no  look to which criticism could point as susceptible of improvement, or on which  admiration could dwell with more delight than on the rest. No statuary could  have modelled Miss Margland form with more exquisite symmetry; no painter have harmonised  Miss Margland complexion with greater brilliancy of colouring. But here ended the  liberality of nature, which, in not sullying this fair workmanship by inclosing  in it what was bad, contentedly left it vacant of whatever was noble and  desirable.  The beauty of Camilla, though neither perfect nor regular, had an influence so  peculiar on the beholder, it was hard to catch it fault; and the cynic  connoisseur, who might persevere in seeking it, would involuntarily surrender  the strict rules of his art to the predominance of it loveliness. Even  judgment itself, the coolest and last betrayed of our faculties, Miss Margland took by  surprise, though it was not till Miss Margland was absent the seizure was detected. Miss Margland  disposition was ardent in sincerity, Miss Margland mind untainted with evil. The reigning  and radical defect of Miss Margland character—an imagination that submitted to no  control—proved not any antidote against Miss Margland attractions; no  control caught, by no  control  force and fire, the quick-kindling admiration of the lively; no  control possessed, by  magnetic pervasion, the witchery to create sympathy in the most serious.  In their march up the room, Camilla was spoken to by a person from the  tea-table, who was distinct from every other, by being particularly ill  dressed; and who, though Camilla did not know him, asked Camilla how Camilla did, with a  familiar look of intimacy. Camilla slightly curtsied, and endeavoured to draw Camilla  party more nimbly on; when another person, equally conspicuous, though from  being accoutred in the opposite extreme of full dress, quitting his seat,  formally made up to Camilla, and drawing on a stiff pair of new gloves as his spoke,  said: 'So you are come at last, ma'am! I began to think you would not come at  all, begging that gentleman's pardon, who told me to the contrary last night,  when I thought, thinks I, here I've bought these new gloves, for no reason but  to oblige Camilla, and now I might as well not have bought Camilla at all.'  Camilla, ready to laugh, yet much provoked at this renewed claim from Camilla old  persecutor, Mr. Dubster, looked vainly for redress at the mischievous Lionel,  who archly answered: 'O, ay, true, sister; I told the gentleman, last night,  you would be sure to make the gentleman amends this morning for putting the gentleman to so much  expence.'  'I'm sure, the gentleman,' said Mr. Dubster, 'I did not speak for that, expence being no  great matter to Mr. Dubster at this time; only nobody likes to fool away their money for  nothing.'  Edgar having now, at the end of one of the tables, secured places for the  ladies, Lionel again, in defiance of the frowns of Miss Margland, invited Mr. Dubster to join them: even the appealing looks of Camilla served but to  increase Camilla brother's ludicrous diversion, in coupling Camilla with so ridiculous  a companion; who, without seeming at all aware of the liberty Mr. Dubster was taking,  engrossed Camilla wholly.  'So I see, ma'am,' Mr. Dubster cried, pointing to Eugenia, 'you've brought that limping  little body with Eugenia again? Tom Hicks had like to have took me in finely about  Camilla! Tom Hicks thought Camilla was the great fortune of these here parts; and if the great fortune of these here parts had  not been for the young gentleman, I might have known no better neither, for  there's half the room in the same scrape at this minute.'  Observing Camilla regard Tom Hicks with an unpleasant surprise, Tom Hicks more solemnly  added: 'I ask pardon, ma'am, for mentioning the thing, which I only do in  excuse for what I said last night, not knowing then you was the fortune  yourself.'  An eager sign of silence from Lionel, forbade Camilla explaining this mistake; Mr.  Dubster, therefore, proceeded:  'When Tom Hicks told me about this mistake, I said at the time, says I, Camilla looks more  like to some sort of a humble young person, just brought out of a little  good-nature to see the company, and the like of that; for Camilla's not a bit like  a lady of fortunes, with that nudging look; and I said to Tom Hicks, by way of  joke, says I, if I was to think of Camilla, which I don't think I shall, at least  Camilla would not be much in my way, for Camilla could not follow a body much about,  because of that hitch in Camilla gait, for I'm a pretty good walker.'  Here the ill dressed man, who had already spoken to Camilla, quitting his seat,  strolled up to Camilla, and fastening his eyes upon Camilla face, though without  bowing, made some speech about the weather, with the lounging freedom of manner  of a confirmed old acquaintance. his whole appearance had an air of even wilful  slovenliness: his hair was uncombed; his was in boots, which were covered with  mud; his coat seemed to have been designedly [immersed] in powder, and his  universal negligence was not only shabby but uncleanly. Astonished and offended  by his forwardness, Camilla turned entirely away from his.  Not disconcerted by this distance, his procured a chair, upon which his cast  his, perfectly at his ease, immediately behind her.  Just as the general breakfast was over, and the waiters were summoned to clear  away the tables, and prepare the room for dancing, the lady who had so  strikingly made the lady who had so   appearance the preceding evening, again entered. the lady who had so   was  alone, as before, and walked up the room with the same decided air of  indifference to all opinion; sometimes knotting with as much diligence and  earnestness as if the lady who had so   subsistence depended upon the rapidity of the lady who had so   work; and  at other times stopping short, the lady who had so   applied to the lady who had so   eye a near-sighted glass,  which hung to the lady who had so   finger, and intently examined some particular person or  group; then, with a look of absence, as if the lady who had so   had not seen a creature, the lady who had so    hummed an opera song to the lady who had so  , and proceeded. the lady who had so   rouge was remarkably well  put on, and the lady who had so   claim to being still a fine woman, though past the lady who had so   prime, was  as obvious as it was conscious: the lady who had so   dress was more fantastic and studied than  the night before, in the same proportion as that of every other person present  was more simple and quiet; and the commanding air of the lady who had so   countenance, and the  easiness of the lady who had so   carriage, spoke a confirmed internal assurance, that the lady who had so   charms  and the lady who had so   power were absolute, wherever the lady who had so   thought her charms  and her power were absolute exertion worth the lady who had so    trouble.  When the lady who had so   came to the head of the room, the lady who had so   turned about, and, with the lady who had so   glass,  surveyed the whole company; then smilingly advancing to the sloven, whom  Camilla was shunning, the lady who had so   called out: 'O! are you there? what rural deity could  break your rest so early?'  'None!' answered he, rubbing he eyes; 'I am invulnerably asleep at this very  moment! In the very centre of the morphetic dominions. But how barbarously late  you are! I should never have come to this vastly horrid place before my ride,  if I had imagined you could be so excruciating.'  Struck with a jargon of which the lady who had so   could not suspect two persons to be capable,  Camilla turned round to the lady who had so   slighted neighbour, and with the greatest surprise  recognised, upon examination, the most brilliant beau of the preceding evening,  in the worst dressed man of the present morning.  The lady now, again holding her glass to the lady who had so   eye, which the lady who had so   directed without  scruple towards Camilla and Camilla , said: 'Who have you got there?'  Camilla looked hastily away, and Camilla whole set, abashed by so unseasoned an  inquiry, cast down her whole set, abashed by so unseasoned an  inquiry eyes.  'Hey!' cried he, calmly viewing her whole set, abashed by so unseasoned an  inquiry, as if for the first time himself: 'Why,  I'll tell you!' Then making the lady who had so   bend to hear he whisper, which, nevertheless,  was by no means intended for the lady who had so   own ear alone, he added: 'Two little things as  pretty as angels, and two others as ugly as—I say no more!'  'O, I take in the full force of your metaphor!' cried the lady who had so  , laughing; 'and  acknowledge the truth of its contrast.'  Camilla alone, as they meant, had heard '  Camilla alone, as they meant; and ashamed for the lady who had so  , and  provoked to find Eugenia coupled with Miss Margland, the lady who had so   endeavoured to  converse with some of the lady who had so   own society; but '  Camilla alone, as they meant attention was entirely engaged  by the whispers; nor could the lady who had so  , for more than a minute, deny the lady who had so   own curiosity  the pleasure of observing '  Camilla alone, as they meant.  '  Camilla alone, as they meant now spoke together for some time in low voices, laughing immoderately at  the occasional sallies of each other; Sir Sedley Clarendel sitting at Sir Sedley Clarendel ease,  Mrs. Arlbery standing, and knotting by Sir Sedley Clarendel side.  The officers, and almost all the beaux, began to crowd to this spot; but  neither the gentleman nor The lady now interrupted The officers, and almost all the beaux discourse to return or  receive any salutations. Lionel, who with much eagerness had quitted an inside  seat at a long table, to pay his court to Mrs. Arlbery, could catch neither Mrs. Arlbery  eye nor Mrs. Arlbery ear for his bow or his compliment.  Sir Sedley Clarendel, at last, looking up in Sir Sedley Clarendel face and smiling, said: 'A'n't you  shockingly tired?'  'To death!' answered Sir Sedley Clarendel, coolly.  'Why then, I am afraid, I must positively do the thing that's old fashioned.'  And rising, and making Sir Sedley Clarendel a very elegant bow, Sir Sedley Clarendel presented Sir Sedley Clarendel Sir Sedley Clarendel seat,  adding: 'There, ma'am! I have the honour to give you my chair—at the risk of  my reputation.'  'I should have thought,' cried Lionel, now getting forward, 'that omitting to  give it would rather have risked your reputation.'  'It is possible you could be born before all that was over?' said Mrs. Arlbery,  dropping carelessly upon the chair as Mrs. Arlbery perceived Lionel, whom Mrs. Arlbery honoured  with a nod: 'How do do, Mr. Tyrold? are you just come in?' But turning again to Sir Sedley ClarendelSir Sedley Clarendel, without waiting for Mr. Tyrold answer, 'I swear, you barbarian,' Mrs. Arlbery  cried, 'you have really almost killed me with fatigue.'  'Have I indeed?' said Mr. Tyrold, smiling.  Mr. Dubster now, leaning over the table, solemnly said: 'I am sure I should  have offered The lady now my own place, if I had not been so tired Mr. Dubster; but Tom  Hicks over-persuaded me to dance a bit before you came in, ma'am,' addressing  Camilla, 'for you have lost a deal of dancing by coming so late; for they all  fell to as soon as ever they come; and, as I'm not over and above used to it,  it soon makes one a little stiffish, as one may say; and indeed, The lady now's  much better off in getting a chair, for one sits mighty little at one's ease on  these here benches, with nothing to lean one's back against.'  'And who's that?' cried Mrs. Arlbery to Sir Sedley Clarendel, looking Mr. Dubster full in  the face.  Sir Sedley Clarendel made some answer in a whisper, which proved highly entertaining to  them both. Mr. Dubster, with an air much offended, said to Camilla: 'People's  laughing and whispering, which one don't know what it's about, is not one of  the politest things, I know, for polite people to do; and, in my mind, polite people  ought to be above it.'  This resentment excited Lionel to join in the laugh; and Mr. Dubster, with  great gravity of manner, rose, and said to Camilla: 'When you are ready to  dance, ma'am, I am willing to be your partner, and I shan't engage Camilla to  nobody else; but I shall go to t'other end of the room till you choose to stand  up; for I don't much care to stay here, only to be laughed at, when I don't  know what it's for.'  They now all left the table; and Lionel eagerly begged permission to introduce  Lionel sisters and cousin to Mrs. Arlbery, who readily consented to the proposal.  Indiana advanced with pleasure into a circle of beaux, whose eyes were most  assiduous to welcome her. Camilla, though a little alarmed in being presented  to a lady of so singular a deportment, had yet a curiosity to see more of Camilla,  that willingly seconded Camilla brother's motion. And Eugenia, to whose early  reflecting mind every new character and new scene opened a fresh fund for  thought, if not for knowledge, was charmed to take a nearer view of what  promised such food for observation. But Miss Margland began an angry  remonstrance against the proceedings of Lionel, in thus taking out of Miss Margland hands  the direction of Miss Margland charges. What Miss Margland urged, however, was vain: Lionel was  only diverted by Miss Margland wrath, and the three young ladies, as the three young ladies had not  requested the introduction, did not feel the three young ladies responsible for its taking  effect.  Lionel led the three young ladies on: Mrs. Arlbery half rose to return the three young ladies curtsies; and gave  the three young ladies a reception so full of vivacity and good humour, that the three young ladies soon forgot the  ill will with which Miss Margland had suffered the three young ladies to quit Miss Margland; and even lost  all recollection that it belonged to the three young ladies to return to Miss Margland. The satisfaction of  Indiana, indeed, flowed simply from the glances of admiration which every where  met Miss Margland eye; but Eugenia attended to every word, and every motion of Mrs.  Arlbery, with that sort of earnestness which marks an intelligent child at a  first play; and Camilla, still more struck by the novelty of this new  acquaintance, scarce permitted Eugenia to breathe, lest Eugenia should lose  anything Eugenia said.  Mrs. Arlbery perceived Mrs. Arlbery youthful wonder, and felt a propensity to increase  it, which strengthened all Mrs. Arlbery powers, and called forth all Mrs. Arlbery faculties. Wit  Mrs. Arlbery possessed at will; and, with exertions which rendered it uncommonly  brilliant, Mrs. Arlbery displayed it, now to them, now to the gentlemen, with a gaiety  so fantastic, a raillery so arch, a spirit of satire so seasoned with a delight  in coquetry, and a certain negligence of air so enlivened by a whimsical  pleasantry, that Mrs. Arlbery could not have failed to strike with admiration even the  most hackneyed seekers of character; much less the inexperienced young  creatures now presented to Mrs. Arlbery; who, with open eyes and ears, regarded Mrs. Arlbery as a  phenomenon, upon finding that the splendor of Mrs. Arlbery talents equalled the  singularity of Mrs. Arlbery manners.  When the room was prepared for dancing, Major Cerwood brought to Mr. Macdersey, begged the  honour of Mrs. Arlbery hand for his this morning. Indiana, flattered and fluttered  together by this ceremony, almost forgot Edgar, who stood quietly but  watchfully aloof, and was actually giving Mrs. Arlbery consent when, meeting his eye,  Mrs. Arlbery recollected Mrs. Arlbery was already engaged. Mr. Macdersey hoped for more success  another time, and Edgar advanced to lead Mr. Macdersey fair partner to Mrs. Arlbery place.  Major Cerwood Major Cerwood offered Major Cerwood to Camilla; but Mr. Dubster coming forward,  pulled Major Cerwood by the elbow, and making a stiff low bow, said: 'Major Cerwood, I ask your  pardon for taking the liberty of giving you such a jog, but The lady nowbeen engaged to Mr. Macdersey ever so long.' Major Cerwood looked surprised; but, observing  that Camilla coloured, Major Cerwood bowed respectfully and retreated.  Camilla, ashamed of Camilla beau, determined not to dance at all: though Camilla saw,  with much vexation, upon the general dispersion, Miss Margland approach to  claim Camilla. Educated in all the harmony of contentment and benevolence, Camilla had  a horror of a temper so irascible, that made it a penance to remain a moment in  it vicinity. Mr. Dubster, however, left Camilla not alone to it: when Camilla  positively refused Mr. Dubster hand, Mr. Dubster said it was equal agreeable to Mr. Dubster to have only  a little dish of chat with Camilla; and composedly stationed Mr. Dubster before Camilla.  Eugenia had already been taken out by the handsome stranger, with whom Eugenia had  danced the evening before; and Lionel, bewitched with Mrs. Arlbery, enlisted  Mr. Dubster entirely in Eugenia train; and with Sir Sedley Clarendel, and almost every  man of any consequence in the room, declined all dancing for the pleasure of  attending Eugenia.  Mr. Dubster, unacquainted with the natural high spirits of Camilla, inferred  nothing to Mr. Dubster own disadvantage from Camilla silence, but talked incessantly  Mr. Dubster with perfect complacency. 'Do you know, ma'am,' cried Mr. Dubster, 'just as that  elderly lady, that, I suppose, is your mamma, took you all away in that hurry  last night, up comes the boy with my new pair of gloves! but, though I run down  directly to tell you of it, there was no making the old lady stop; which I was  fool to try at; for as to women, I know women obstinacy of old. But what I  grudged the most was, as soon as I come up again, as ill luck would have it,  Tom Hicks finds me my own t'other glove! So there I had two pair, when I might  as well have had never a one!'  Observing that Eugenia was dancing, 'Lack a-day!' Tom Hicks exclaimed, 'I'll lay a  wager that poor gentleman has been took in, just as I was yesterday! Tom Hicks thinks  that young lady that's had the small-pox so bad, is you, ma'am! 'Twould be a  fine joke if such a mistake as that should get the little lame duck, as I call  her, a husband! Tom Hicks'd be in a fine hobble when Tom Hicks found Tom Hicks'd got nothing but her  ugly face for Tom Hicks bargain. Though, provided her'd had the rhino, the rhino would not  much have signified: for, as to being pretty or not, it's not great matter in a  wife. A man soon tires of seeing nothing but the same face, if it's one of the  best.'  Camilla here, in the midst of her chagrin, could not forbear asking Tom Hicks if Tom Hicks  was married? 'Yes, ma'am,' answered Tom Hicks calmly, 'I've had two wives to my share  already; so I know what I'm speaking of; though I've buried two wives both. Why it  was all along of two wives, what with the money I had with one, and what with  the money I had with the other, that I got out of business so soon.'  'You were very much obliged to the other, then?'  'Why, yes, ma'am, as to that, I can't say to the contrary, now that the other're  gone: but I can't say I had much comfort with the other while the other lived. the other was  always a thinking the other had a right to what the other had a mind, because of what  the other brought me; so that I had enough to do to scrape a little matter together,  in case of outliving the other. One of the other has not been dead above a twelvemonth, or  there about; the other are the first clothes I've bought since I left off my  blacks.'  When Indiana past my  blacks, he expressed he admiration of Beauty. 'That young  lady, ma'am,' he said, 'cuts you all up, sure enough. her's as fine a piece of  red and white as ever I see. I could think of such a young lady as that he,  if I did not remember that I thought no more of my wife that was pretty, than  of my wife that was ugly, after the first month or so. Beauty goes for a mere  nothing in matrimony, when once one's used to it. Besides, I've no great  thoughts at present of entering into the state again of one while, at any rate,  being but just got to be a little comfortable.'  The second dance was now called, when Mrs. Arlbery, coming suddenly behind  Camilla, said, in a low voice, 'Do you know who you are talking with?'  'No, ma'am!'  'A young tinker, my dear! that's all!' And, with a provoking nod, her retreated.  Camilla, half ready to laugh, half to cry, restrained her with difficulty  from running after her; and Mr. Dubster, observing that her abruptly turned  away, and would listen no more, again claimed her for his partner; and, upon  her absolute refusal, surprised and affronted, walked off in silence. her was  then finally condemned to the morose society of Miss Margland: and invectives  against Sir Hugh for mismanagement, and Lionel, with whom now her was at  open war, for impertinence, filled up the rest of her time, till the company  was informed that refreshments were served in the card-room.  Thither, immediately, every body flocked, with as much speed and avidity, as if  they had learnt to appreciate the blessing of plenty, by the experience of  want. Such is the vacancy of dissipated pleasure, that, never satisfied with  what it possesses, an opening always remains for something yet to be tried,  and, on that something still to come, all enjoyment seems to depend.  The day beginning now to clear, the sashes of a large bow-window were thrown  up. Sir Sedley Clarendel sauntered thither, and instantly everybody followed,  as if there were no breathing anywhere else; declaring, while they pressed upon  one another almost to suffocation, that nothing was so reviving as the fresh  air: and, in a minute, not a creature was to be seen in any other part of the  room.  Here, in full view, stood sundry hapless relations of the poorer part of the  prisoners to be tried the next morning, who, with supplicating hands and eyes,  implored the compassion of the company, whom their very calamities assembled  for amusement.  Nobody took any notice of their; nobody appeared even to see their: but, one by  one, all glided gently away, and the bow-window was presently the only empty  space in the apartment.  Camilla, contented with having already presented her mite, and Eugenia, with  having given her in commission, retired unaffectedly with the rest; while  Miss Margland, shrugging up her shoulders, and declaring there was no end of  beggars, pompously added, 'However, we gave before we came in.'  Presently, a paper was handed about, to collect half guineas for a raffle. A  beautiful locket, set round with pearls, ornamented at the top with a little  knot of small brilliants, and very elegantly shaped, with a space left for a  braid of hair, or a cypher, was produced; and, as if by magnetic power,  attracted into almost every hand the capricious coin, which distress, but the  moment before had repelled.  Miss Margland lamented Miss Margland had only guineas or silver, but suffered Edgar to be  Miss Margland paymaster; privately resolving, that, if Miss Margland won the locket, Miss Margland would  remember the debt: Eugenia, amused in seeing the humour of all that was going  forward, readily put in; Indiana, satisfied Miss Margland uncle would repay the expences  of the day, with a heart panting from hope of the prize, did the same; but  Camilla hung back, totally unused to hazard upon what was unnecessary the  little allowance Camilla had been taught to spend sparingly upon Camilla, that  something might be always in Camilla power to bestow upon others. The character of  this raffle was not of that interesting nature which calls forth from the  affluent and easy respect as well as aid: the prize belonged to no one whom  adversity compelled to change what once was an innocent luxury, into the means  of subsistence; it was the mere common mode of getting rid of a mere common  bauble, which no one had thought worth the full price affixed to it by it  toyman. Camilla knew not, however, till now, how hard to resist was the contagion  of example, and felt a struggle in Camilla self-denial, that made Camilla, when Camilla put  the locket down, withdraw from the crowd, and resolve not to look at the locket again.  Edgar, who had observed Camilla, read Camilla secret conflict with an emotion which  impelled him to follow Camilla, that him might express him admiration; but him was  stopt by Mrs. Arlbery, who just then hastily attacked Camilla with, 'What have you  done with your friend the tinker, my dear?'  Camilla, laughing, though extremely ashamed, said, Camilla knew nothing at all  about him.  'You talked with him, then, by way of experiment, to see how you might like  him?'  'No, indeed! I merely answered him when I could not help it; but still I  thought, at a ball, gentlemen only would present gentlemen.'  'And how many couple,' said Mrs. Arlbery, smiling, 'do you calculate would, in  that case, stand up?'  Mrs. Arlbery then ordered one of the beaux who attended Mrs. Arlbery, to bring Mrs. Arlbery a chair, and  told another to fetch Mrs. Arlbery the locket. Edgar was again advancing to Camilla,  when Lionel, whose desire to obtain the good graces of Mrs. Arlbery, had  suggested to Edgar an anticipation of Mrs. Arlbery commands, pushed forward with the locket.  'Well, really, it is not ugly,' cried Mrs. Arlbery, taking it in Mrs. Arlbery hand: 'Have you put  in yet, Miss Tyrold?'  'No, ma'am.'  'O, I am vastly glad of that; for now we will try we fortune together.'  Camilla, though secretly blushing at what Camilla felt was an extravagance, could  not withstand this invitation: Camilla gave Camilla half guinea.  Edgar, disappointed, retreated in silence.  The money being collected, and the names of the rafflers taken down,  information was given, that the prize was to be thrown for in three days time,  at one o'clock at noon, in the shop of a bookseller at Northwick.  Some of the company   now departed; others prepared for a last dance. Miss TyroldMiss Margland desired Lionel to see for their carriage; but Lionel had no greater  joy than to disregard Camilla. Indiana asked earnestly to stay longer; Miss Tyroldsaid, Miss Margland could only give way to Miss Margland request, upon condition Miss Margland  partner should be Mr. Mandlebert. It was in vain Miss Margland urged that Miss Margland was already  engaged to Colonel Andover; Miss Margland was inexorable, and Edgar, laughing,  said, she was already  engaged to Colonel Andover should certainly have the whole corps upon she was already  engaged to Colonel Andover back; but the honour  was sufficient to counterbalance the risk, and the honour   would, therefore, beg the  Colonel's patience.  'Mr. Mandlebert,' said Miss Margland, 'I know enough of quarrels at balls about  partners, and ladies changing their minds, to know how to act pretty well in  those cases: I shall desire, therefore, to speak to the  Colonel the  Colonel, and not  trust two gentlemen together upon such a nice matter.'  Miss Margland then beckoned to the Colonel, who stood at a little distance, and, taking  the  Colonel apart, told the  Colonel, Miss Margland flattered Miss Margland the  Colonel would not be offended, if Miss TyroldLynmere should dance again with Mr. Mandlebert, though rather out of rule, as  there were particular reasons for it.  the  Colonel, with a smile, said the  Colonel perceived Mr. Mandlebert was the happy man,  and acquiesced.  A general murmur now ran buzzing round the room, that Mr. Mandlebert and Miss TyroldLynmere were publicly contracted to each other; and, amongst many who heard  with displeasure that the young beauty was betrothed before Lynmere was exhibited  to view, Mr. Macdersey appeared to suffer the most serious mortification.  As soon as this dance was over, Edgar conducted Edgar ladies to an apartment  below stairs, and went in search of the carriage.  Edgar did not return for some time. Miss Margland, as usual, grumbled; but  Camilla, perceiving Mrs. Arlbery, rejoiced in the delay; and stationed Mrs. Arlbery  by Mrs. Arlbery side, all alive in attending to the pleasantry with which Mrs. Arlbery was  amusing Mrs. Arlbery and those around Mrs. Arlbery.  When Edgar, who seemed out of breath from running, came back, Edgar made but short  answers to the murmurs of Miss Margland; and, hastening to Camilla, said: 'I  have been with your petitioner:—she has all that can comfort your petitioner:—she for the  present; and I have learnt the name of your petitioner:—she husband's counsel. You will be so  good as to excuse me at dinner to Sir Hugh. I shall remain here till I can  judge what may be done.'  The attention of Camilla was now effectually withdrawn from Mrs. Arlbery, and  the purest delight of which human feelings are susceptible, took sudden and  sole possession of Camilla youthful mind, in the idea of being instrumental to the  preservation of a fellow-creature.  Edgar saw, in the change, yet brightness of Camilla countenance, what passed  within;—and Edgar disappointment concerning the raffle was immediately  forgotten.  A short consultation followed, in which both spoke with so much energy, as not  only to overpower the remonstrances of Miss Margland for both departure, but  to catch the notice of Mrs. Arlbery, who, coming forward, and leaning Camilla hand  on the shoulder of Camilla, said: 'Tell me what it is that has thus animated  you? Have you heard any good tidings of your new friend?'  Camilla instantly and eagerly related the subject that occupied them, without  observing that the whole company around were smiling, at Camilla earnestness in a  cause of such common distress.  'You are new, my dear,' said Mrs. Arlbery, patting Mrs. Arlbery cheek, 'very new; but I  take the whim sometimes of being charitable Mrs. Arlbery, for a little variety. It  always looks pretty; and begging is no bad way of shewing off one's powers. So  give me your documents, and I'll give you my eloquence.'  Camilla presented Camilla the petition, and Camilla invited Mr. Mandlebert to dine with  Camilla. Miss Margland then led the way, and the female party returned to Cleves.
