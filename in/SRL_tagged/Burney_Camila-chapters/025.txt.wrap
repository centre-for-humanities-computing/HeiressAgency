 An Author's Notion of Travelling  The next morning Camilla, sad and unwilling to appear, was the last who entered  the breakfast-parlour. Edgar instantly discerned the continued unhappiness,  which an assumed smile concealed from the unsuspicious Sir Hugh, and the week  of delay before him seemed an outrage to all his wishes.  While she was drinking her first cup of tea, a servant came in, and told her  the carriage was ready.  She coloured, but nobody spoke, and the servant retired. Edgar was going to ask  the design for the morning, when Miss Margland said—'Miss Camilla, as the  horses have got to go and return, you had better not keep them waiting.'  Colouring still more deeply, she was going to disclaim having ordered them,  though well aware for what purpose they were come, when Sir Hugh said—'I  think, my dear, you had best take Eugenia with you, which may serve you as a  companion to talk to, in case you want to say anything by the way, which I take  for granted; young people not much liking to hold their tongues for a long  while together, which is very natural, having so little to think of.'  'Miss Eugenia, then,' cried Miss Margland, before Camilla could reply, 'run for  your cloak as soon as you have finished your breakfast.'  Eugenia, hoping to aid her sister in performing a task, which she considered as  a peace-offering to Indiana, said, she had already done.  Camilla now lost all courage for resistance; but feeling her chagrin almost  intolerable, quitted the room with her tea undrunk, and without making known if  she should return or not.  Eugenia followed, and Edgar, much amazed, said, he had forgotten to order his  horse for his morning's ride, and hastily made off: determined to be ready to  hand the sisters to the carriage, and learn whither it was to drive.  Camilla, who, in flying to her room, thought of nothing less than preparing for  an excursion which she now detested, was again surprised in tears by Eugenia.  'What, my dearest Camilla,' she cried, 'can thus continually affect you? you  cannot be so unhappy without some cause!—why will you not trust your Eugenia?'  'I cannot talk,' she answered, ashamed to repeat reasons which she knew Eugenia  held to be inadequate to her concern—'If there is no resource against this  persecution—if I must render myself hateful to give them satisfaction, let  us, at least, be gone immediately, and let me be spared seeing the person I so  ungratefully offend.'  She then hurried down stairs; but finding Edgar in waiting, still more quickly  hurried back, and in an agony, for which she attempted not to account, cast  herself into a chair, and told Eugenia, that if Miss Margland did not contrive  to call Edgar away, the universe could not prevail with her to pass him in such  defiance.  'My dear Camilla,' said Eugenia, surprized, yet compassionately, 'if this visit  is become so painful to you, relinquish it at once.'  'Ah, no! for that cruel Miss Margland will then accuse me of staying away only  to follow the counsel of Edgar.'  She stopt; for the countenance of Eugenia said—'And is that not your motive?'  A sudden consciousness took place of her distress; she hid her face, in the  hope of concealing her emotion, and with as calm a voice as she could attain,  said, the moment they could pass unobserved she would set off.  Eugenia went downstairs.  'Alas! alas!' she then cried, 'into what misery has this barbarous Miss  Margland thrown me! Eugenia herself seems now to suspect something wrong; and  so, I suppose, will my uncle; and I can only convince them of my innocence by  acting towards Edgar as a monster.—Ah! I would sooner a thousand times let  them all think me guilty!'  Eugenia had met Miss Margland in the hall, who, impatient for their departure,  passed her, and ascended the stairs.  At the sound of her footsteps, the horror of her reproaches and insinuations  conquered every other feeling, and Camilla, starting up, rushed forward, and  saying 'Good morning!' ran off.  Edgar was still at the door, and came forward to offer her his hand. 'Pray take  care of Eugenia,' she cried, abruptly passing him, and darting, unaided, into  the chaise. Edgar, astonished, obeyed, and gave his more welcome assistance to  Eugenia; but when both were seated, said—'Where shall I tell the postillion  to drive?'  Camilla, who was pulling one of the green blinds up, and again letting it down,  twenty times in a minute, affected not to hear him; but Eugenia answered, 'to  the Grove, to Mrs. Arlbery's.'  The postillion had already received his orders from Miss Margland, and drove  off; leaving Edgar mute with surprise, disappointment and mortification.  Miss Margland was just behind him, and conceived this the fortunate instant for  eradicating from his mind every favourable pre-possession for Camilla;  assuming, therefore, an air of concern, she said—'So, you have found Miss  Camilla out, in spite of all her precautions! she would fain not have had you  know her frolic.'  'Not know it! has there, then, been any plan? did Miss Camilla intend——'  'O, she intends nothing in the world for two minutes together! only she did not  like you should find out her fickleness. You know, I told you, before, she was  all whim; and so you will find. You may always take my opinion, be assured.  Miss Lynmere is the only one among them that is always the same, always good,  always amiable.'  'And is not Miss——' he was going to say Camilla, but checking himself,  finished with—'Miss Eugenia, at least, always equal, always consistent?'  'Why, she is better than Miss Camilla; but not one among them has any  steadiness, or real sweetness, but Miss Lynmere. As to Miss Camilla, if she has  not her own way, there's no enduring her, she frets, and is so cross. When you  put her off, in that friendly manner, from gadding after a new acquaintance so  improper for her, you set her into such an ill humour, that she has done  nothing but cry, as you may have seen by her eyes, and worry herself and all of  us round, except you, ever since; but she was afraid of you, for fear you  should take her to task, which she hates of all things.'  Half incredulous, yet half shocked, Edgar turned from this harangue in silent  disgust. He knew the splenetic nature of Miss Margland, and trusted she might  be wrong; but he knew, too, her opportunities for observation, and dreaded lest  she might be right. Camilla had been certainly low spirited, weeping, and  restless; was it possible it could be for so slight, so unmeaning a cause? His  wish was to follow her on horseback; but this, unauthorized, might betray too  much anxiety: he tried not to think of what had been said by Dr. Marchmont,  while this cloud hung over her disposition and sincerity; for whatever might be  the malignity of Miss Margland, the breach of a promise, of which the voluntary  sweetness had so lately proved his final captivation, could not be doubted, and  called aloud for explanation.  He mounted, however, his horse, to make his promised enquiries of Mrs. Needham;  for though the time was already past for impeding the acquaintance from taking  place, its progress might yet be stopt, should it be found incompatible with  propriety.  The young ladies had scarce left the Park, when Sir Hugh, recollecting a  promise he had made to Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold, of never suffering Eugenia to go  abroad unattended by some gentleman, while Bellamy remained in the country,  sent hastily to beg that Edgar would follow the carriage.  Edgar was out of sight, and there was no chance of overtaking him.  'Lack-a-day!' said Sir Hugh, 'those young folks can never walk a horse but full  gallop!' He then resolved to ask Dr. Orkborne to go after his pupil, and ride  by the side of the chaise. He ordered a horse to be saddled; and, to lose no  time by messages, the tardiness of which he had already experienced with this  gentleman, he went himself to his apartment, and after several vain rappings at  his door, entered the room unbid, saying—'Good Dr. Orkborne, unless you are  dead, which God forbid! I think it's something uncomfortable that you can't  speak to a person waiting at your door; not that I pretend to doubt but you may  have your proper reasons, being what I can't judge.'  He then begged he would get booted and spurred instantly, and follow his two  nieces to Mrs. Arlbery's, in order to take care of Eugenia; adding, 'though I'm  afraid, Doctor, by your look, you don't much listen to me, which I am sorry  for; my not being able to speak like Horace and Virgil being no fault of mine,  but of my poor capacity, which no man can be said to be answerable for.'  He then again entreated him to set off.  'Only a moment, sir! I only beg you'll accord me one moment!' cried the Doctor,  with a fretful sigh; while, screening his eyes with his left hand, he  endeavoured hastily to make a memorandum of his ideas, before he forced them to  any other subject.  'Really, Dr. Orkborne,' said Sir Hugh, somewhat displeased, 'I must needs  remark, for a friend, I think this rather slow: however, I can't say I am much  disappointed, now, that I did not turn out a scholar myself, for I see, plain  enough, you learned men think nothing of any consequence but Homer and such;  which, however, I don't mean to take ill, knowing it was like enough to have  been my own case.'  He then left the room, intending to send a man and horse after the chaise, to  desire his two nieces to return immediately.  Dr. Orkborne, who, though copiously stored with the works of the ancients, had  a sluggish understanding, and no imagination, was entirely overset by this  intrusion. The chain of his observations was utterly broken; he strove vainly  to rescue from oblivion the slow ripening fruits of his tardy conceptions, and,  proportioning his estimation of their value by their labour, he not only  considered his own loss as irreparable, but the whole world to be injured by so  unfortunate an interruption.  The recollection, however, which refused to assist his fame, was importunate in  reminding him that the present offender was his patron; and his total want of  skill in character kept from him the just confidence he would otherwise have  placed in the unalterable goodness of heart of Sir Hugh, whom, though he  despised for his ignorance, he feared for his power.  Uneasy, therefore, at his exit, which he concluded to be made in wrath, he  uttered a dolorous groan over his papers, and compelled himself to follow, with  an apology, the innocent enemy of his glory.  Sir Hugh, who never harboured displeasure for two minutes in his life, was more  inclined to offer an excuse himself for what he had dropt against learning,  than to resist the slightest concession from the Doctor, whom he only begged to  make haste, the horse being already at the door. But Dr. Orkborne, as soon as  he comprehended what was desired, revived from the weight of sacrificing so  much time; he had never been on horseback since he was fifteen years of age,  and declared, to the wondering baronet, he could not risk his neck by  undertaking such a journey.  In high satisfaction, he would then have returned to his room, persuaded that,  when his mind was disembarrassed, a parallel between two ancient authors which,  with much painful stretch of thought, he had suggested, and which, with the  most elaborate difficulty, he was arranging and drawing up, would recur again  to his memory: but Sir Hugh, always eager in expedients, said, he should follow  in the coach, which might be ready time enough for him to arrive at Mrs.  Arlbery's before the visit was over, and to bring Eugenia safe back; 'which,'  cried he, 'is the main point, for the sake of seeing that she goes no where  else.'  Dr. Orkborne, looking extremely blank at this unexpected proposition, stood  still.  'Won't you go, then, my good friend?'  The Doctor, after a long pause, and in a most dejected tone, sighed out, 'Yes,  sir, certainly, with the greatest—alacrity.'  Sir Hugh, who took everything literally that seemed right or good-natured,  thanked him, and ordered the horses to be put to the coach with all possible  expedition.  It was soon at the door, and Dr. Orkborne, who had spent in his room the  intervening period, in moaning the loss of the time that was to succeed, and in  an opinion that two hours of this morning would have been of more value to him  than two years when it was gone, reluctantly obeyed the call that obliged him  to descend: but he had no sooner entered the carriage, and found he was to have  it to himself, than leaping suddenly from it, as the groom, who was to attend  him, was preparing to shut the door, he hastened back to his chamber to collect  a packet of books and papers, through the means of which he hoped to recall  those flowers of rhetoric, upon which he was willing to risk his future  reputation.  The astonished groom, concluding something had frightened him, jumped into the  coach to find the cause of his flight; but Sir Hugh, who was advancing to give  his final directions, called out, with some displeasure 'Hollo, there, you  Jacob! if Dr. Orkborne thinks to get you to go for my nieces in place of  himself, it's what I don't approve; which, however, you need not take amiss,  one man being no more born with a livery upon his back than another; which God  forbid I should think otherwise. Nevertheless, my little girls must have a  proper respect shewn them; which, it's surprising Dr. Orkborne should not know  as well as me.'  And, much disconcerted, he walked to the parlour, to ruminate upon some other  measure.  'I am sure, your honour,' said Jacob, following him, 'I got in with no ill  intention; but what it was as come across the Doctor I don't know; but just as  I was a going to shut the door, without saying never a word, out he pops, and  runs upstairs again; so I only got in to see if something had hurt him; but I  can't find nothing of no sort.'  Then, putting to the door, and looking sagaciously, 'Please your honour,' he  continued, 'I dare say it's only some maggot got into his brain from over  reading and writing; for all the maids think he'll soon be cracked.'  'That's very wrong of them, Jacob; and I desire you'll tell them they must not  think any such thing.'  'Why, your honour don't know half, or you'd be afraid too,' said Jacob,  lowering his voice; 'he's like nothing you ever see. He won't let a chair nor a  table be dusted in his room, though they are covered over with cobwebs, because  he says, it takes him such a time to put his things to rights again; though all  the while what he calls being to rights is just the contrary; for it's a mere  higgledy piggledy, one thing heaped o'top of t'other, as if he did it for fun.'  The baronet gravely answered, that if there were not the proper shelves for his  books he would order more.  'Why, your honour, that's not the quarter, as I tell you! why, when they're  cleaning out his room, if they happen but to sweep away a bit of paper as big  as my hand, he'll make believe they've done him as much mischief as if they'd  stole a thousand pound. It would make your honour stare to hear him. Mary says,  she's sure he has never been quite right ever since he come to the house.'  'But I desire you'll tell Mary I don't approve of that opinion. Dr. Orkborne is  one of the first scholars in the world, as I am credibly informed; and I beg  you'll all respect him accordingly.'  'Why, your honour, if it i'n't owing to something of that sort, why does he  behave so unaccountable? I myself heard him making such a noise at the maids  one day, that I spoke to Mary afterwards, and asked her what was the  matter?—"Laws, nobody knows," says she, "but here's the Doctor been all in a  huff again; I was just a dusting his desk (says she) and so I happened to wipe  down a little bundle of papers, all nothing but mere scraps, and he took on as  if they'd been so many guineas (says she) and he kept me there for an hour  looking for them, and scolding, and telling such a heap of fibs, that if he was  not out of his head, would be a shame for a gentleman to say" (says she).'  'Fie, fie, Jacob! and tell Mary fie, too. He is a very learned gentleman, and  no more a story-teller than I am myself; which God forbid.'  'Why, your honour, how could this here be true? he told the maids how they had  undone him, and the like, only because of their throwing down them few bits of  papers; though they are ready to make oath they picked them up, almost every  one; and that they were all of a crump, and of no manner of use.'  'Well, well, say no more about it, good Jacob, but go and give my compliments  to Dr. Orkborne, and ask him, what's the reason of his changing his mind; I  mean, provided it's no secret.'  Jacob returned in two minutes, with uplifted hands and eyes; 'your honour,'  cried he, 'now you'll believe me another time! he is worse than ever, and I'll  be bound he'll break out before another quarter.'  'Why, what's the matter?'  'Why, as sure as I'm here, he's getting together ever so many books, and  stuffing his pockets, and cramming them under his arms, just as if he was a  porter! and when I gave him your honour's message, I suppose it put him out,  for he said, "Don't hurry me so, I'm a coming;" making believe as if he was  only a preparing for going out, in the stead of making that fool of himself.'  Sir Hugh, now really alarmed, bid him not mention the matter to anyone; and was  going upstairs himself, when he saw Dr. Orkborne, heavily laden with books in  each hand, and bulging from both coat pockets, slowly and carefully coming down.  'Bless me,' cried he, rather fearfully, 'my dear sir, what are you going to do  with all that library?'  Dr. Orkborne, wishing him good morning, without attending to his question,  proceeding to the carriage, calling to Jacob, who stood aloof, to make haste  and open the door.  Jacob obeyed, but with a significant look at his master, that said, 'you see  how it is, sir!'  Sir Hugh following him, gently put his hand upon his shoulder, and mildly said,  'My dear friend, to be sure you know best, but I don't see the use of loading  yourself in that manner for nothing.'  'It is a great loss of time, sir, to travel without books,' answered the  Doctor, quietly arranging them in the coach.  'Travel, my good friend? Why, you don't call it travelling to go four or five  miles? why, if you had known me before my fall—However, I don't mean to make  any comparisons, you gentlemen scholars being no particular good horsemen.  However, if you were to go one hundred miles instead of four or five, you could  not get through more than one of those books, read as hard as you please;  unless you skip half, which I suppose you solid heads leave to the lower  ignoramusses.'  'It is not for reading, sir, that I take all these books, but merely to look  into. There are many of them I shall never read in my life, but I shall want  them all.'  Sir Hugh now stared with increased perplexity; but Dr. Orkborne, as eager to  go, since his books were to accompany him, as before to stay, told Jacob to bid  the coachman make haste. Jacob looked at his master, who ordered him to mount  his mare, and the carriage drove off.  The baronet, in some uneasiness, seated himself in the hall, to ruminate upon  what he had just heard. The quietness and usual manner of speaking and looking  of Dr. Orkborne, which he had remarked, removed any immediate apprehensions  from the assertions of Jacob and Mary; but still he did not like the  suggestion; and the carrying off so many books, when he acknowledged he did not  mean to read one of them, disturbed him.  In every shadow of perplexity, his first wish was to consult with his brother;  and if he had not parted with both his carriages, he would instantly have set  off for Etherington. He sent, however, an express for Mr. Tyrold, begging to  see him at Cleves with all speed.
