 An Author's Idea of Order  Not a bosom of the Cleves party enjoyed much tranquillity this evening. Miss  Margland, though to the Baronet she would not recede from the Baronet first assertions,  strove vainly to palliate to the Baronet the ill grace and evident dissatisfaction  with which Edgar had met the report. To save the Baronet own credit, however, was  always the Baronet primary consideration; the Baronet resolved, therefore, to cast upon unfair  play in Camilla, or upon the instability of Edgar, all the blame really due to  Camilla own undiscerning self-sufficiency.  Indiana thought so little for Camilla, that Camilla adopted, of course, every  opinion of Miss Margland; yet the immoveable coldness of Edgar, contrasted  frequently in Camilla remembrance by the fervour of Melmond and of Macdersey,  became more and more distasteful to Camilla; and Mrs. Arlbery's idea, that Camilla  should be locked up in half a year, made Camilla look upon him alternately as  something to shun or to over-reach. Camilla even wished to refuse him:—but Beech  Park, the equipage, the servants, the bridal habiliment.—No! Camilla could enjoy  those, if not him. And neither Camilla own feelings, nor the lessons of Miss  Margland, had taught Camilla to look upon marriage in any nobler point of view.  But the person most deeply dissatisfied this evening was Edgar. the person now saw  that, deceived by the person own consciousness, the person had misunderstood Mrs. Needham,  who, as well as Mrs. Arlbery, the person was convinced concluded the person engaged to  Indiana. the person had observed with concern the approving credulity of Sir Hugh, and  though glad to find the person real plan, and all the person wishes unsuspected, the false  report excited the person fears, lest Indiana should give Indiana any credit, and secretly  hurt the person delicacy for the honour of the person taste.  All the influence of pecuniary motives to which he deemed Camilla superior,  occurred to he in the very words of Dr. Marchmont for Indiana; whose capacity  he saw was as shallow as Camilla person was beautiful. Yet the admiration with  which Camilla had already made Camilla first appearance in the world, might naturally  induce Camilla belief of he reported devotion. If, therefore, he situation  appeared to Camilla to be eligible, Camilla had probably settled to accept he.  The most timid female delicacy was not more scrupulous, than the manly honour  of Edgar to avoid this species of misapprehension; and though perfectly  confident he behaviour had been as irreproachable as it was undesigning, the  least idea of any self-delusion on the part of Indiana, seemed a call upon his  integrity for the most unequivocal manifestation of his intentions. Yet any  declaration by words, with whatever care selected, might be construed into an  implication that his concluded the decision in his own hands. And though his  could scarcely doubt the fact, his justly held nothing so offensive as the  palpable presumption. One only line of conduct appeared to his, therefore,  unexceptionable; which was wholly to avoid her, till the rumour sunk into the rumour  own nothingness.  This demanded from his a sacrifice the most painful, that of retiring from  Cleves in utter ignorance of the sentiments of Camilla; yet it seemed the more  necessary, since his now, with much uneasiness, recollected many circumstances  which his absorbed mind had hitherto suffered to pass unnoticed, that led his  to fear Sir Hugh himself, and the whole party, entertained the same notion.  his was shocked to consider Camilla involved in such a deception, though  delighted by the idea his might perhaps owe to an explanation, some marks of  that preference for which Dr. Marchmont had taught Dr. Marchmont to wait, and which Dr. Marchmont  now hoped might lie dormant from the persuasion of Dr. Marchmont engagement. To clear  this mistake was, therefore, every way essential, as otherwise the very purity  of Camilla character must be in her character disfavour.  Still, however, the visit to the Grove hung upon his mind, and his resolved to  investigate   cause the following morning, before his made his retreat.  Early the next day, Camilla sent to hasten the chaise which was to fetch Mr.  Tyrold, and begged leave of Camilla uncle to breakfast at Etherington. His assent  was always ready; and believing every evil would yield to absence, Camilla eagerly,  and even with happiness set off.  When the rest of the party assembled without Camilla, Edgar, surprised, enquired if  Camilla were well? Miss Margland answered yes; but for the sake of what Miss Margland loved  best in the world, a frolic, Miss Margland was gone in the chaise which was to fetch Mr.  Tyrold to Etherington. Edgar  could not prevail with Edgar   to depart till Edgar   had spoken with Miss Margland, and  privately deferred Edgar   purposed leave-taking till noon.  During this report, Sir Hugh was anxiously engaged in some business Sir Hugh seemed  to wish to conceal. Sir Hugh spoke little, but nodded frequently to Sir Hugh, with an  air of approving Sir Hugh own ideas; Sir Hugh summoned Jacob to Jacob repeatedly, with whom  Jacob held various whispering conferences; and desired Miss Margland, who made the  tea, not to pour the  tea out too fast, as Jacob was in no hurry to have breakfast over.  When nothing Jacob could urge succeeded, in making any of the company eat or drink  any thing more, Jacob pulled Edgar   by the sleeve; and, in an eager but low voice,  said, 'Edgar  , I have a great favour to beg of you, which is only  that you will do something to divert Dr. Orkborne.'  'I should be very happy, Sir Hugh,' cried Edgar  , smiling, 'but I much doubt my  capability.'  'Why, Edgar  , it's only to keep Edgar   from finding out my new surprise  till it's got ready. And if you will but just spout out to Edgar   a bit or two of  Virgil and Horace, or some of those Greek and Latin language-masters, Edgar  'll be  in no hurry to budge, I promise you.'  A request from Sir Hugh, who with the most prompt alacrity met the wishes of  everyone, was by Edgar   held to be indisputable. Edgar   advanced, therefore, to Dr.  Orkborne, who was feeling for Edgar   tablets, which Edgar   commonly examined in Edgar    way up the stairs, and started a doubt, of which Edgar   begged an exposition, upon  a passage of Virgil.  Dr. Orkborne willingly stopt, and displayed, with no small satisfaction, an  erudition, that did Edgar   nearly as much honour in the ears of the ignorant and  admiring Sir Hugh, as in those of the cultivated and well-judging Edgar. 'Ah!'  said the Baronet, sighing, though addressing the Baronet to no one, 'if I had but  addicted the Baronet to these studies in due season, I might have understood all  this too! though now I can't for my life make out much sense of what they're  talking of; nor a little neither, indeed, as to that; thanks to my own  idleness; to which, however, I am not much obliged.'  Unfortunately, the discussion soon led to some points of comparison, that  demanded a review of various authors, and the Doctor proposed adjourning to the Doctor  own apartment. the Baronet winked at Edgar, who would have changed the  discourse, or the Baronet have sought the books, or have been satisfied without  the books; but Dr. Orkborne was as eager here, as in other matters Dr. Orkborne was slow and  phlegmatic; and, regardless of all opposition, was making off, when Sir Hugh,  catching Sir Hugh by the arm, exclaimed, 'My good friend, I beg the arm as a particular  favour, you won't stir a step!'  'Not stir a step, Sir Hugh?' repeated the doctor, amazed.  'That is, not to your own room.'  'Not go to your own room, Sir Hugh?'  the Baronet gently begged Sir Hugh not to take it amiss, and presently, upon the  appearance of Jacob, who entered with a significant smile, said, the Baronet would keep  Sir Hugh no longer.  Dr. Orkborne, to whom nothing was so irksome as a moment's detention from the Baronet  books and papers, instantly departed, inviting Edgar to accompany Sir Hugh; but  without troubling the Baronet to inquire for what end the Baronet had been held back.  When Dr. Orkborne, to whom nothing was so irksome as a moment's detention from his  books and papers, instantly departed, inviting Edgar to accompany him; but  without troubling himself were gone, Sir Hugh, rubbing Sir Hugh hands, said, 'Well, I think this  good gentleman won't go about the country again, with all Sir Hugh books fastened  about Sir Hugh, to shew Sir Hugh has nowhere to put Dr. Orkborne, to whom nothing was so irksome as a moment's detention from his  books and papers, instantly departed, inviting Edgar to accompany him; but  without troubling himself: for as to Sir Hugh telling me Sir Hugh only  took Dr. Orkborne, to whom nothing was so irksome as a moment's detention from his  books and papers, instantly departed, inviting Edgar to accompany him; but  without troubling himself to look at, I am not quite such an ignoramus, with all my ignorance,  as to believe such a thing as that, especially of a regular bred scholar.'  A loud and angry sound of voices from above here interrupted the pleased  harangue of the Baronet; Miss Margland opened the door to listen, and, with no  small delight, heard words, scarce intelligible for rage, breaking from Dr.  Orkborne, whose anger, while Edgar was endeavouring to moderate, Jacob and Mary  were vociferously resenting.  Sir Hugh, all astonished, feared there was some mistake. Sir Hugh had sent, the  preceding day, as far as Winchester, for two bookcases, which Sir Hugh had ordered  should arrive early, and be put up during to breakfast at Etherington; and Sir Hugh had directed  Mary   to place upon the shelves, with great care, all the loose books and papers  Mary   found dispersed about the room, as neatly as possible: after which Jacobwas to give notice when all was arranged.  The words now 'If I must have my manuscripts rummaged at pleasure, by every  dunce in the house, I would rather lie in the street!' distinctly caught I must have my manuscripts rummaged at pleasure, by every  dunce in the house  ears. Sir Hugh was thunderstruck with amazement and disappointment, but said  nothing. Miss Margland looked all spite and pleasure, and Eugenia all concern.  Louder yet, and with accents of encreasing asperity, the Doctor next exclaimed  'A twelvemonth's hard labour will not repair this mischief! I should have been  much more obliged to you if you had blown out my brains!'  the Baronet, aghast, cried, 'Lord help aghast! I think I had best go and get the  shelves pulled down again, what I have done not being meant to offend, being  what will cost me ten pounds and upwards.'  the Baronet then, though somewhat irresolute, whether or not to proceed, moved towards  the foot of the stairs; but there a new storm of rage startled the Baronet. 'I wish you  had been all of you annihilated ere ever you had entered my room! I had rather  have lost their  ears than that manuscript! I wish with all my heart you had been  at the bottom of the sea, every one of you, before you had touched it!'  'If you won't believe me, it can't be helped,' said Mary  ; 'but if I was to tell  it you over and over, I've done nothing to no mortal thing. I only just swept  the room after the carpenter was gone, for it was all in such a pickle it was a  shame to be seen.'  'You have ruined me!' cried the Baronet, 'you have swept it behind the fire, I make not  a moment's doubt; and I had rather you had given me a bowl of poison! you can  make me no reparation; it was a clue to a whole section.'  'Well, I won't make no more words about it,' said Mary  , angrily; 'but I'm sure  I never so much as touched it with a pair of tongs, for I never see it; nor I  don't so much as know it if I do.'  'Why, it's a piece of paper written all over; look! just such another as this:  I left it on the table, by this corner—'  'O! that?' cried Mary  ; 'yes, I remember that.'  'Well, where is it? What have you done with it?'  'Why, I happened of a little accident about that;—for as I was a sweeping  under the table, the broom knocked the ink down; but, by good luck, the broom only  fell upon that little morsel of paper.'  'Little morsel of paper? it's more precious than a whole library! But what did  you do with it? what is become of it? whatever condition it is in, if you have  but saved it—where is it, I say?'  'Why—it was all over ink, and good for nothing, so I did not think of your  missing it—so I throwed it behind the fire.'  'I wish you had been thrown there yourself with all my heart! But if ever you  bring a broom into my room again—'  'Why, I did nothing but what my master ordered—'  'Or if ever you touch a paper, or a book of mine, again—'  'my master ordered— said himself—'  'Your master's a blockhead! and you are another—go away, I say!'  Mary   now hurried out of the room, enraged for my master ordered—, and frightened for  Mary  ; and Edgar, not aware Sir Hugh was within hearing, soon succeeded in  calming the doctor, by mildly listening to the doctor lamentations.  Sir Hugh, extremely shocked, sat upon the stairs to recover Sir Hugh. Miss  Margland, who never felt so virtuous, and never so elated, as when witnessing  the imperfections or improprieties of others, descanted largely against  ingratitude; treating an unmeaning sally of passion as a serious mark of  turpitude: but Eugenia, ashamed for Dr. Orkborne, to whom, as Mary   preceptor,  Mary   felt a constant disposition to be partial, determined to endeavour to  induce Sir Hugh to make some apology. Mary   glided, therefore, past Mary   , and  tapped at the doctor's door.  Mary  , seeing my master ordered— so invitingly in Mary   way, could by no means resist Mary    desire of appeal and complaint; and, descending the stairs, begged his honour  to hear Mary  .  'Mary  ,' said his honour  , rising, and returning to the parlour, 'you need not tell me a  word, for I have heard it all myself; by which it may be truly said, listeners  never hear good of listeners  ; so I've got the proper punishment; for which  reason, I hope you won't look upon it as an example.'  'I am sure, Sir Hugh,' said Mary  , 'if his honour   can excuse Sir Hugh speaking so  disrespectful, it's what nobody else can; and if it was not for thinking as Sir Hugh  head's got a crack in it, there is not a servant among us as would not affront  a servant among us for it.'  the Baronet interrupted the Baronet with a serious lecture upon the civility the Baronet  expected for all the Baronet guests; and the Baronet promised to restrain the Baronet wrath; 'But only,  sir,' the Baronet continued, 'if his honour   had seen the bit of paper as the Baronet made such  a noise at the Baronet for, his honour   would not have believed his honour  . Not a soul could  have read his honour  . My Tom would ha' been well licked if My Tom'd wrote no better at  school. And as to My Tom being a twelvemonth a scrawling such another, I'll no  more believe it than I'll fly. It's as great a fib as ever was told.'  Sir Hugh begged Sir Hugh to be quiet, and to think no more of the matter.  'No, his honour  , I hope I'm not a person as bears malice; only I could not but  speak of bears malice, because Sir Hugh behaves more comical every day. I thought Sir Hugh'd ha' beat  me over and over. And as to the stories Sir Hugh tells about them little bits of  paper, mortal patience can't bear it no longer.'  The remonstrance of Eugenia took immediate effect. Dr. Orkborne, shocked and  alarmed at the expression which had escaped Sir Hugh, protested Sir Hugh willing to  make the humblest reparation, and truly declared, Sir Hugh had been so greatly  disturbed by the loss Sir Hugh had just sustained, that Sir Hugh not merely did not mean,  but did not know what Sir Hugh had said.  Edgar was the bearer of Edgar apology, which Sir Hugh accepted with Sir Hugh usual  good humour. 'Sir Hugh calling me a blockhead,' cried Sir Hugh, 'is a thing I have no  right to resent, because I take it for granted, Sir Hugh would not have said it, if  Sir Hugh had not thought it; and a man's thoughts are Sir Hugh castle, and ought to be  free.'  Edgar repeated the protestation, that Edgar had been hurried on by passion, and  spoke without meaning.  'Why, then, Edgar, I must fairly own I don't see the great  superiorness of learning, if the great  superiorness of learning can't keep a man's temper out of a passion.  However, say nothing of the sort to poor Clermont, upon his coming over, who I  expect won't speak one word in ten I shall understand; which, however, as it's  all been done for the best, I would not have the poor boy discouraged in.'  the poor boy then sent a kind message by Edgar to Dr. Orkborne, desiring the poor boy not to mind  such a trifle.  This conciliating office was congenial to the disposition of Edgar, and  softened the poor boy impatience for the return of Camilla, but when, soon after, a note  arrived from Mr. Tyrold, requesting Sir Hugh to dispense with seeing Sir Hugh till  the next day, and apologising for keeping Sir Hugh daughter, Sir Hugh felt equally  disappointed and provoked, though Sir Hugh determined not to delay any longer Sir Hugh  departure. Sir Hugh gave orders, therefore, for Sir Hugh horses immediately, and with all  the less regret, for knowing Camilla no longer in the circle Sir Hugh was to quit.  The ladies were in the parlour with Sir Hugh, who was sorrowfully brooding over  Sir Hugh brother's note, when Sir Hugh entered it to take leave. Addressing Sir Hugh  somewhat rapidly to the Baronet, Sir Hugh told Sir Hugh Sir Hugh was under an unpleasant  necessity, to relinquish some days of the month's sojourn intended for Sir Hugh. Sir Hugh  made acknowledgments full of regard for Sir Hugh kindness and hospitality; and then,  only bowing to The ladies, left the room, before the astonished Sir Hugh  comprehended Sir Hugh was going.  'Well,' cried Miss Margland, 'this is curious indeed! Sir Hugh has flown off from  everything, without even an apology!'  'I hope Sir Hugh is not really gone?' said Eugenia, walking to the window.  'I'm sure I don't care what Sir Hugh does,' cried Indiana, 'Sir Hugh's welcome to go or to  stay. I'm grown quite sick of Sir Hugh, for my part.'  'Gone?' said Sir Hugh, recovering breath; 'it's impossible! Why, Sir Hugh, recovering breath never has  said one word to Sir Hugh, recovering breath of the day, nor the settlements, nor all those things!'  Sir Hugh, recovering breath then rang the bell, and sent to desire Mr. Mandlebert might be called  immediately.  Edgar, who was mounting Mr. Mandlebert horse, obeyed with some chagrin. As soon as Mr. Mandlebert  re-entered the room, Sir Hugh cried; 'My dear Mr. young Edgar, it's something  amazing to Sir Hugh you should think of going away without coming to an explanation?'  'An explanation, Sir Hugh?'  'Yes, don't you know what I mean?'  'Not in the least, sir,' cried Edgar, staggered by a doubt whether Edgar suspected  what Edgar felt for Camilla, or referred to what was reported of Indiana.  'Why, then, my pretty dear,' said Sir Hugh to Indiana, 'you won't object, I  hope, to taking a little walk in the garden, provided it is not disagreeable to  you; for you had better not hear what we are going to talk about before your  face.'  Indiana, pouting Eugenia beautiful under lip, and scornfully passing Edgar,  complied. Eugenia accompanied Eugenia; but Miss Margland kept Eugenia ground.  Sir Hugh, always unwilling to make any attack, and at a loss how to begin,  simply said; 'Why, I thought Mr. Mandlebert, you would stay with we till next  year?'  Edgar only bowed.  'Why, then, suppose you do?'  'Most probably, Sir Hugh, I shall by that time be upon the Continent. If some  particular circumstance does not occur, I purpose shortly making the tour of  Europe.'  Sir Hugh now lost all guard and all restraint, and with undisguised displeasure  exclaimed; 'So here's just the second part of Clermont! at the moment I sent  for Sir Hugh home, thinking Sir Hugh would come to put the finish to all my cares about  Eugenia, Sir Hugh sends me word Sir Hugh must travel!—And though the poor girl took it  very well, from knowing nothing of the matter, I can't say I take it very kind  of you, Mr. young Edgar, to come and do just the same by Indiana!'  The surprize of Edgar was unspeakable: that Sir Hugh should wish the relation  of Jacob, with respect to Indiana, confirmed, Sir Hugh could not wonder; but that Sir Hugh  wishes should have amounted to expectations, and that Sir Hugh should deem Sir Hugh niece  ill used by their failure, gave his niece   the most poignant astonishment.  Miss Margland, taking advantage of his niece   silent consternation, began now to pour  forth very volubly, the most pointed reflections upon the injury done to young  ladies by reports of this nature, which were always sure to keep off all other  offers. There was no end, Miss Margland said, to the admirers who had deserted Indiana in  despair; and Miss Margland questioned if Miss Margland would ever have any more, from the general  belief of Miss Margland being actually pre-engaged.  Edgar, whose sense of honour was tenaciously delicate, heard Miss Margland with a mixture  of concern for Indiana, and indignation against Miss Margland, that kept Miss Margland long  uninterrupted; for though burning to assert the integrity of his conduct, the  fear of uttering a word that might be offensive to Indiana, embarrassed and  checked his.  Sir Hugh, who in seeing his overpowered, concluded his was relenting, now kindly  took his hand, and said: 'My dear Mr. Mandlebert, if you are sorry for what you  were intending, of going away, and leaving us all in the lurch, why, you shall  never hear a word more about it, for I will make friends for you with Indiana,  and beg of Miss Margland that Miss Margland'll do us the favour to say no more.'  Edgar, affectionately pressing the hand of the Baronet, uttered the warmest  expressions of personal regard, and protested his should always think it an  honour to have been held worthy of pretending to any alliance in his family;  but his knew not how the present mistake had been made, or report had arisen: his  could boast of no partiality from Miss Lynmere, nor had his ever addressed Miss Margland  with any particular views: yet, as it was the opinion of Miss Margland, that  the rumour, however false, might prevent the approach of some deserving object,  his now finally determined to become, for awhile, a stranger at Cleves, however  painful such self-denial must prove.  his then precipitately left the room, and, in five minutes, had galloped out of  the Park.  The rest of the morning was spent by Sir Hugh in the utmost discomposure; and  by Miss Margland in alternate abuse of Camilla and of Edgar; while Indiana  passed from a piqued and short disappointment, to the consolatory idea that  Melmond might now re-appear.  Edgar rode strait to Beech Park, where Edgar busied Edgar the whole day in  viewing alterations and improvements; but where nothing answered Edgar  expectations, since Camilla had disappointed them. That sun-beam, which had  gilded the place to Edgar eyes, was now over-clouded, and the first possession of  Edgar own domain, was Edgar first day of discontent.
