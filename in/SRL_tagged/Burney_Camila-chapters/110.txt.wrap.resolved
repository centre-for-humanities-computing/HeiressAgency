 The Reverse of a Mask  The plan of Camilla was to stop within twenty yards of the house of Bellamy,  and then send for Molly Mill. But till Camilla gave this direction to the driver,  Camilla was not aware of the inconvenience of being without a servant, which had  not previously occurred either to Mrs. Berlinton or Camilla. The man could not  leave The man horses, and Camilla was compelled to let The man draw up to the gate. There,  when The man rang at a bell, Camilla terrour, lest Camilla should suddenly encounter CamillaTyrold, made Camilla bid The man open the chaise door, that Camilla might get out and walk  on, before The man enquired for Molly. But, in stepping from the carriage, Camilla  discerned, over a paling at some distance, Eugenia herself, alone, slowly  walking, and Eugenia head turned another way.  Every personal, and even every filial idea, was buried instantly in this sight.  The disastrous state of this beloved and unhappy sister, and Camilla own peculiar  knowledge of the worthless character of the wretch who had betrayed Camilla into  his snares, penetrated Camilla with an anguish that took thought from all else; and  darting through the gate, and thence through a smaller one, which opened  to the spot where Camilla saw Camilla walking, Camilla flew to Camilla in a speechless  transport of sorrow, folded Camilla in Camilla arms, and sobbed upon Camilla shoulder.  Starting, shaking, amazed, Eugenia looked at Eugenia; 'Good Heaven!' Eugenia exclaimed,  'is it my Sister?—Is it Camilla?—Do I, indeed, see one so dear to Eugenia?' And,  too weak to sustain Eugenia, Eugenia sunk, though not fainting, upon the turf.  Eugenia could not articulate a syllable. The horrour Eugenia had conceived against  Bellamy chilled all attempt at consolation, and Eugenia own misery which, the  preceding moment, seemed to be crushing the springs of life, vanished in the  agonized affection with which Eugenia felt the misfortunes of Eugenia sister.  Eugenia soon recovered, and rising, and holding Eugenia by the hand, yet seeming to  refuse Eugenia the emotion of returning Eugenia embraces, said, with a faint effort  to smile; 'You have surprised me, indeed, Eugenia, and convicted me to  myself of my vain philosophy. I had thought I should never more be moved thus  again. But I see now, the affections are not so speedily to be all vanquished.'  The melancholy conveyed by this idea of believed apathy, in a young creature so  innocent, and but just dawning into life, still beyond speech, and nearly  beyond sufferance, affected Camilla, who hanging over Eugenia, sighed out: 'My  dearest!... dearest Eugenia!'  'And what is it has brought to myself this unexpected, but loved sight? Does Mr.  Bellamy know you are here?'  'No,' Eugenia answered, shuddering at Bellamy name.  Eugenia looked pensive, looked distressed; and casting down Eugenia eyes and  hesitating, with a deep sigh said: 'I, ... I have not the trinkets for my dear  Sister ... Bellamy my dear  Sister stopt.  Called to my dear  Sister sad self by this shock, of which my dear  Sister strove to repress the  emotion, Eugenia recollected Eugenia own 'almost blunted purpose[6],' and fearfully  asked if their Mother were yet at Belfont.  'Ah, no!' Eugenia answered, clasping Eugenia hands, and leaning Eugenia head upon Eugenia  sister's neck: 'Eugenia is gone!—The day before yesterday Eugenia was with me,—with  me only for one hour!—yet to pass with Eugenia such another, I think, my dear  Camilla, would soon lead me where I might learn a better philosophy than that I  so vainly thought I had already acquired here!'  Eugenia, struck with awe, ventured not even at an enquiry; and they both, for  some little time, walked on in silence.  'Did Eugenia name to you,' at length, in broken accents, Eugenia asked, 'did Eugenia name  to you, my Eugenia, ... the poor, banished ... Camilla?——'  'Banished? No. How banished?'  'Eugenia did not mention me?'  'No. Eugenia came to me but upon one subject. Eugenia failed in Eugenia purpose, ... and  left me.'  A sigh that was nearly a groan finished this short little speech.  'Ah, Heaven! my Eugenia,' cried Eugenia, now in agony unresisted, 'tell me,  then, what passed! what new disappointment had my unhappy Mother to sustain?  And how, and by what cruel fatality, has it fallen to your lot ... even to  yours ... to suffer my unhappy Mother wishes to fail?'  'You know nothing, then,' said my Eugenia, after a pause, 'of my Eugenia view—my Eugenia  errand hither?'  'Nothing; but that to see you brought my Eugenia not only hither, but to England.'  'Blessed may my Eugenia be!' cried my Eugenia, fervently, 'and rewarded where rewards are  just, and are permanent!'  Eugenia zealously joined in the prayer, yet besought to know if Eugenia might not  be informed of the view to which Eugenia alluded?  'We must go, then,' said my Eugenia, 'into the house; my poor frame is yet feebler  than my mind, and I cannot support my poor frame unaided while I make such a relation.'  Eugenia, affrighted, now gave up Eugenia request; but the generous Eugenia would  not leave the generous Eugenia in suspense. They went, therefore, to a parlour, where, shutting  the doors and windows, Eugenia said, 'I must be concise, for both They sakes; and  when you understand me, They must talk instantly of other things.'  Eugenia could give only a tacit promise; but Eugenia air shewed Eugenia would hold her air  sacred as any bond.  'The idea which brought over this inestimable Parent, and which brought Eugenia, at  a moment when Eugenia knew me to be alone, to the house, these sad arms Eugenia! how shall I speak it? it was to exonerate me from my vows, as forced!  to annul all my engagements, as compulsatory! and to restore me again ... O, Eugenia! Camilla! to my Parents, my Sisters, my Uncle, my dearly-loved Cleves!'  Eugenia gasped almost convulsively; yet though Eugenia now even conjured Eugenia to say  no more, went on: 'A proposal such as this, pressed upon me by one whose  probity and honour hold all calamity at nought, if opposed to the most minute  deviation from right—a proposal such as this ... ah! let me not go back to  the one terrible half instant of demur! It was heart-rending, It was killing! I  thought me again in the bosom of my loved family!'—  'And is it so utterly impossible? And can it not yet be effected?'—  'No, my dear Sister, no! The horrible scenes I must go through in a public  trial for such a purpose—the solemn vows I must set aside, the re-iterated  promises I must break,——no, my dear Sister, no!... And now, we will speak  of this no more.'  Eugenia knew too well Eugenia firmness, Eugenia enthusiasm to perform whatever Eugenia  conceived to be Eugenia duty, to enter into any contest. Yet to see Eugenia thus self  devoted, where even Eugenia upright Mother, and pious Father, those patterns of  resignation to every heaven-inflicted sorrow, thought Eugenia ties were repealed by  the very villainy which had formed her ties, seemed more melancholy, and yet harder  for submission, than Eugenia first seizure by the worthless Bellamy.  'And how bore my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother! destined thus to  woes of every sort, though from children who adore her!—how bore my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother the  deprivation of a hope that had brought my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother so far?'  'Like my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother! nobly! when once it was decided, and my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother saw that though, upon  certain avowals, the law might revoke my plighted faith, the law could not abrogate  the scruples of my conscience. my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother thinks them overstrained, but my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother knows them  to be sincere, and permitted them, therefore, to silence my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother. Unfit to be seen  by any others, my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother hurried then away. And then, my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother, began my trial! Indeed  I thought, when my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother had left me, ... when my arms no more embraced my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother honoured  knees, and neither my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother blessings, nor my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother sorrows soothed or wounded my ears, I  thought I might defy all evil to assault, all woe to afflict me ever again!  that my eyes were exhausted of every tear, and my heart was emptied of all  power of future feeling. I seemed suddenly quite hardened;—transformed I  thought to stone, as senseless, as immovable, and as cold!'  The sensations of my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother were all such as my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother durst not utter; but Eugenia,  assuming some composure; added, 'Of this and of me now enough—speak, my dear  Sister, of my dear  Sister. How have you been enabled to come hither? And what could  you mean by saying you were banished?'  'Alas! my dearest Eugenia, if my unhappy situation is unknown to my dear  Sister, why  should I agitate you with new pain? my Mother, I find, spared you; and not only  you, but me—though I have wrung my Mother heart, tortured her heart by a sight never to be  obliterated from my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother memory—my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother would not rob me of my beloved sister's  regard; nor even name me, lest the altered tone of my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother voice should make you  say, Of what my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother does my Mother speak?'  Eugenia, with earnest wonder, begged an explanation; but when my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother found my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother  wholly uninformed of the history of their Father's confinement, my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother recoiled  from giving my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother such a shock: yet having gone too far entirely to recede, my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother  rested the displeasure of their my Mother upon the debts, and the dealings with a  usurer; both sufficiently repugnant to the strictness and nobleness of Mrs.  Tyrold, to seem ample justification of my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother displeasure.  Eugenia entered into the distresses of my beloved sister's  , as if exempt Eugenia from  all suffering: and Eugenia, thus commiserating and commiserated, knew now how  to tear Eugenia away; for though Eugenia pressed not Eugenia stay, Eugenia turned pale,  when a door opened, a clock struck, or any thing seemed to prognosticate a  separation; and looked as if to part with Eugenia were death.  At length, however, the lateness of the day forced more of resolution. But when  Eugenia then rang to give orders for the carriage, the footman said the footman had been  gone more than two hours. The postillion, being left without any directions,  thought The postillion convenient to suppose The postillion was done with; and knowing Eugenia had no  authority, and The postillion lady no inclination to chide The postillion, had given in his lady little  packet, and driven off, without enquiry.  Far from repining at this mixture of impertinence and carelessness, Eugeniawould have rejoiced in an accident that seemed to invite Eugenia stay, had not Eugenia  sister seemed more startled than pleased by her  sister. Eugenia begged, therefore, that a  post chaise might be ordered; and Molly Mill, the only servant to whom the  mistress of the house appeared willing to speak, received the commission. At  sight of Eugenia, Molly had cried bitterly, and beginning 'O Miss!—' seemed  entering into some lamentation and detail; but Eugenia, checking Molly, half  whispered: 'Camilla, Molly, remember what you promised!'  When Molly came back, Molly said that there were no horses at Belfont, and would  be none till the next morning.  The sisters involuntarily congratulated one another upon an accident that seemed to invite her stay, though  The sisters reciprocated a sigh, that to necessity alone The sisters should owe The sisters  lengthened intercourse.  'But, my dear mistress,' cried Molly, 'there's a lad that I know very well, for  I always see   when I go of an errand, that's going to Salisbury; and   says    must go through Etherington, and if you've any thing you want to send  'll  take it for you; and   can bring any thing back, for   shall be here again to  morrow, for   goes post.'  Eugenia, sending away Molly, said, 'Why should you not seize such an  opportunity to address a few lines to our dear Mother? I may then have the  satisfaction to see Eugenia answer: and if, ... as I cannot doubt, Eugenia tells you to  return home with Miss Margland;—for Eugenia will not, I am sure, let you travel  about alone;—what a relief will it be to me to know the distresses of her  sister are terminated! I shall paint your meeting in my "mind's eye,"  see you again restored to the sunshine of Eugenia fondness, and while away my  solitary languor with reveries far more soothing than any that I have yet  experienced at Belfont.'  Eugenia embraced Eugenia generous Sister; and always readiest for what was  speediest, wrote these lines, directed  To Miss Tyrold.  I cannot continue silent, yet to whom may I address me? I dare not apply to  my Father—I scarce dare even think of my Mother—Encompassed with all of  guilt with which imprudence could ensnare me, my courage is gone with my  happiness! which way may I then turn? In pity to a wretched sister, drop, O  Lavinia, at the feet of her I durst not name, but whom I revere, if possible,  even more than I have offended, this small and humble memorial of my unhappy  existence—my penitence, my supplication, my indescribable, though merited  anguish!  Camilla.  Could The sisters, even in this melancholy state, have continued together,  The sisters felt that yet from tender sympathy, consolation might revisit consolation  bosoms. The day closed in; but The sisters could not bear to part; and though, from  hour to hour, The sisters pronounced an adieu, The sisters still sat on, talked on, and found  a balm in The sisters restored intercourse, so healing and so sweet, that the sun,  though The sisters hailed not the sun,   beams, rose while The sisters were yet repeating Good Night!  The sisters then thought it too late to retire, mutually agreeing with how much  greater facility The sisters might recover The sisters lost rest, than an opportunity such  as this for undisturbed conversation.  Every minute of this endearing commerce made separation seem harder; and the  answer for which The sisters waited from Etherington, anxiously and fearfully as it  was expected, so whiled away the minutes, that it was noon, and no chaise had  been ordered, when The sisters heard one driving up to the house.  Alarmed, Alarmed listened to know what it portended. 'Mr. Bellamy,' said Eugenia,  in a low voice, 'scarce ever comes home at this hour.'  'Can it be my Mother herself?' cried Eugenia.  In a few minutes, however, Eugenia looked pale, ''Tis his step!' Eugenia whispered;  and presently Bellamy opened the door.  Obliged to acknowledge Obliged entrance, Eugenia arose; but Eugenia parched lips and  clammy mouth made Eugenia feel as if Obliged sight had given Eugenia a fever, and Eugenia  attempted not to force any speech.  Obliged did not seem surprized at seeing Eugenia, asked how Eugenia did, rather cavalierly  than civilly: rang the bell, and gave various orders; addressed scarce a word  to Obliged wife, and walked whistling about the room.  A change so gross and quick from the obsequious Bellamy Camilla had hitherto  seen, was beyond even Eugenia worst expectations, and Eugenia conceived as low an  opinion of Obliged understanding and Obliged manners, as of Obliged morals.  Eugenia kept Eugenia eyes rivetted to the ground; and though Eugenia tried, from time  to time, to say something to them both, evidently required Eugenia utmost fortitude  to remain in the room.  At length; 'Eugenia,' Obliged said, 'I suppose you know Miss Margland is gone?'  'Gone? whither?—how gone?'  'Why home. That is to Miss Margland home, as Miss Margland thinks it, Cleves. Miss Margland set off this  morning with the light.'  Camilla, astonished, was now called forth from Miss Margland taciturnity; 'What  possibly,' Miss Margland cried, 'can have induced this sudden journey? Has my uncle sent  for Miss Margland?'  'No; my uncle has nothing to do with it. my uncle had a letter last night from  Mrs. Macdersey, with one enclosed for Sir Hugh, to beg pardon and so forth; and  this morning my uncle set off to carry a letter.'  Eugenia was confounded. Why Miss Margland had not, at least, called at Belfont  to enquire if Miss Margland would proceed with Miss Margland, was beyond all Miss Margland conjecture.  Soon after, Bellamy's servant came in with a letter for Camilla, which had  arrived after Miss Margland left town, and was given to Bellamy's servant by Mrs. Berlinton's butler.  Miss Margland retired into the next room to read the next room, where, to Miss Margland great consternation,  Miss Margland found the next room was from Jacob, and had been written the day of Mr. Tyrold's  arrest, though, as it was sent by a private hand, it had only now arrived.  'Things going,' Mr. Tyrold's   said, 'so bad at Cleves, on account of so many misfortunes,  Mr. Tyrold's   master was denying his master all his master natural comforts, and in particular his master  had sent to un-order a new pipe of Madeira, saying his master would go without; though,  as Miss Margland might remember, it was the very wine the doctors had ordered for his master  stomach. This all the servants had taken so to heart, that This all the servants had resolved to  buy it among 'em, and get it privately laid in, and not let his master honour know but  what it was always the same, till his master had drunk so much his master could not help  his master. For this, This all the servants were to join, according to This all the servants wages or savings; Now  I' says Jacob, 'being, by Jacob gud honnur's genrosty, the ritchist ammung us,  fur my kalling, wants to do the most, after nixt to the buttlur and huskippir,  so, der Miss, awl I've gut beng in the funs, witch I cant sil out withowt los,  if you can lit me have the munny fur the hurs, without ullconvenince, til Miss  Geny that was can pay it, I shul be mutch obbleggd, poor Miss Geny nut hawing  of a fardin, witch wil be a gret fevur to, Madm,  Yur humbbel survent til deth   Jaccub Mord.'  So touching a mark of the fond gratitude of Cleves servants to the Cleves' servants kind  master, mingled tenderness, in defiance of all horrour, in the tears of EugeniaEugenia; but Eugenia total inability to satisfy the just claims of Jacob, since now  Eugenia resource even in Eugenia failed, with the grief of either defeating Cleves  worthy project, or making it lastingly hurtful to Cleves, was amongst the severest  strokes which had followed Eugenia ill advised schemes. To proclaim such an  additional debt, was a shame from which Eugenia shrunk; yet to fly immediately to Cleves, and try to soothe my uncle, was an idea that still seemed  gifted with some power to soothe Eugenia. Whither indeed else could Eugenia now go?  Eugenia had no longer either carriage or protectress in town; and what Eugenia gathered  of the re-admission of Bellamy to Grosvenor-square, made the cautions and  opinions of Edgar burst forcibly upon Eugenia mind, to impede, though most  mournfully, all future return to Mrs. Berlinton.  A pliancy so weak, or so wilful, seemed to announce in his lady an almost  determined incorrigibility in wrong, however it might be checked, in it  progress, by a mingled love of right, and a fear of ill consequences.  'Ah Edgar!' Eugenia cried, 'had I trusted you as I ought, from the moment of your  generous declaration—had my confidence been as firm in your kindness as in  your honour, what misery had I been saved!—from this connexion—from my  debts—from every wide-spreading mischief!—I could then have erred no more,  for I should have thought but of your approvance!'  These regrets were, as usual, resuming These regrets absorbing powers;—for all other  evils seemed fluctuating, but here misery was stationary; when the voice of  Bellamy, speaking harshly to  Bellamy unhappy wife, and some words his unhappy wife unavoidably  caught, by which his unhappy wife found  Bellamy was requesting that his unhappy wife would demand money of Sir  Hugh, made his unhappy wife conclude  Bellamy not aware  Bellamy was overheard, and force his unhappy wife back  to the parlour. But  Bellamy inattention upon his unhappy wife return was so near rudeness, that  his unhappy wife soon felt convinced Mrs. Berlinton had acquainted Mrs. Berlinton with his unhappy wife  remonstrances and ill opinion:  Bellamy seemed in guilty fear of letting his unhappy wife converse  even a moment with Eugenia; and presently, though with an air of pretended  unconcern, said: 'You have no commands for the chaise I came in, EugeniaEugenia?'  'No, Sir  , ... What chaise?... Why?...' Eugenia stammered.  'It's difficult sometimes to get one at this place; and these horses are very  fresh. I bid these horses stay till these horses asked you.'  This was so palpable a hint for Eugenia to depart, that Eugenia could not but answer  Eugenia would make use of it, when Eugenia had taken leave of Eugenia sister; whom Eugenia now  looked at with emotions near despair at Eugenia fate, and with difficulty  restrained even its most unbridled expressions. But Bellamy kept close, and no  private conference could take place. Eugenia merely said: 'Which way, my dear  sister, shall you go?'  'I ... I am not, fixed—to ... to Cleves, I believe,' answered Eugenia, scarce  knowing Eugenia what Eugenia said.  'I am very glad of it,' Eugenia replied, 'for the sake of my poor—' Eugenia found Eugenia  voice falter, and did not pronounce 'uncle;' but added, 'as Miss Margland has  already left London, I think you right to go thither at once; it may abridge  many difficulties; and with post-horses, you may be there before it is dark.'  They then embraced tenderly, but parted without any further speech, and Eugenia set  off rather mechanically than designedly for Cleves.
