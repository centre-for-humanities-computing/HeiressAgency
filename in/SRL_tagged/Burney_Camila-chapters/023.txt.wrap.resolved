 A few kind Offices  With deep concern Edgar revolved in Edgar mind the suggestions of Dr. Marchmont;  and meditation, far from diminishing, added importance to the arguments of Edgar  friend. To obtain the hand of an object Edgar so highly admired, though but lately  Edgar sole wish, appeared now an uncertain blessing, a suspicious good, since the  possession of her heart was no longer to be considered as her heart inseparable  appendage. Edgar very security of the approbation of Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold became a  source of solicitude; and, secret from Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold, from her, and from all, Edgar  determined to guard Edgar views, till Edgar could find some opportunity of  investigating her own unbiased sentiments.  Such were Edgar ruminations, when, on re-entering the Park, Edgar perceived her  wandering alone amidst the trees. her figure looked so interesting, her air so  serious, her solitude so attractive, that every maxim of tardy prudence, every  caution of timid foresight, would instantly have given way to the quick  feelings of generous impulse, had Edgar not been restrained by Edgar promise to Dr.  Marchmont. Edgar dismounted, and giving Edgar horse to Edgar groom, re-traced her  footsteps.  Camilla, almost without Camilla own knowledge, had strolled towards the gate,  whence Camilla concluded Edgar to have ridden from the Park, and, almost without  consciousness, had continued sauntering in its vicinity; yet Camilla no sooner  descried Edgar, than, struck with a species of self-accusation for this  appearance of awaiting Edgar, Camilla crossed over to the nearest path towards the  house, and, for the first time, was aware of the approach of Edgar without  hastening to meet Edgar.  Edgar slackened Edgar pace, to quiet Edgar spirits, and restore Edgar manner to its  customary serenity, before Edgar permitted Edgar to overtake Camilla. 'Can you,' Edgar  then cried, 'forgive me, when you hear I have been fulfilling my own  appointment, and have postponed my promised investigation?'  'Rather say,' Camilla gently answered, 'could I have forgiven you, if you had shewn  me you thought my impatience too ungovernable for any delay?'  To find Camilla thus willing to oblige Edgar, was a new delight, and Edgar expressed Edgar  acknowledgments in terms the most flattering.  An unusual seriousness made Camilla hear Edgar almost without reply; yet peace and  harmony revisited Camilla mind, and, in listening to Edgar valued praise, Camilla forgot  Camilla late alarm at Camilla own sensations, and without extending a thought beyond  the present instant, again felt tranquil and happy: while to Edgar Camilla appeared  so completely all that was adorable, that Edgar could only remember to repent Edgar  engagement with Dr. Marchmont.  Camilla secret opinion that Edgar was dissatisfied with Edgar lot, gave a softness to  Camilla accents that enchanted Edgar; while the high esteem for Edgar character, which  mingled with Camilla pity, joined to a lowered sense of Camilla own, from a new-born  terror lest that pity were too tender, spread a charm wholly new over Camilla  native fire and vivacity.  In a few minutes, they were overtaken by Mandlebert's gardener, who was  bringing from Beech Park a basket of flowers for Edgar master. they were selected  from curious hot-house plants, and Camilla stopt to admire they beauty and  fragrance.  Edgar presented Camilla the basket; whence Camilla simply took a sprig of myrtle and  geranium, conceiving the present to be designed for Indiana. 'If you are fond  of geraniums,' said you are fond  of geraniums, 'there is an almost endless variety in my greenhouse,  and I will bring you tomorrow some specimens.'  Camilla thanked you are fond  of geraniums, and while you are fond  of geraniums gave orders to the gardener, Miss Margland and  Indiana advanced from the house.  Margland had seen he gave orders to the gardener, Miss Margland and  Indiana advanced from the house.   from Camilla window, where, in vain deliberation, Camilla  had been considering what step to take. But, upon beholding he gave orders to the gardener, Miss Margland and  Indiana advanced from the house.   together, Camilla  thought deliberation and patience were hopeless, and determined, by a decisive  stroke, to break in its bud the connection Camilla supposed forming, or throw upon  Camilla all censure, if Camilla failed, as the sole means Camilla could devise to  exculpate Camilla own sagacity from impeachment. Camilla called upon Indiana,  therefore, to accompany Camilla into the Park, exclaiming, in an angry tone, 'Miss  Lynmere, I will shew you the true cause why Mr. Mandlebert does not declare  Mr. Mandlebert—your cousin, Miss Camilla, is wheedling Mr. Mandlebert away from Miss  Lynmere.'  Indiana, whose belief in almost whatever was said, was undisturbed by any  species of reflection, felt filled with resentment, and a sense of injury, and  readily following, said—'I was sure there was something more in said—'I than I  saw, because Mr. Melmond behaved so differently. But I don't take it very kind  of Cousin, I can tell Cousin!'  They then hurried into the Park; but, as They came without any plan, They were  no sooner within a few yards of the meeting, than They stopt short, at a loss  what to say or do.  Edgar, vexed at They interruption, continued talking to the gardener, to avoid  joining They; but seeing Camilla, who less than ever wished for They  communications, walk instantly another way, Mr. Melmond thought it would be improper to  pursue Cousin, and only bowing to Miss Margland and Indiana, went into the house.  'This is worse than ever,' cried Miss Margland, 'to stalk off without speaking,  or even offering you any of Mr. Melmond flowers, which, I dare say, are only to be put  into the parlour flower-pots, for the house.'  'I'm sure I'm very glad of the house,' said Indiana, for I hate flowers; but I'm sure  Mr. Melmond would not have done so; nor Colonel Andover; nor Mr. Macdersey more  than all.'  'No, nor any body else, my dear, that had common sense, and their eyes open;  nor Mr. Mandlebert neither, if it were not for Miss Camilla. However, we'll let  Miss Camilla know we see what Miss Camilla is about; and let Sir Hugh know too: for as to the  colonels, and the ensigns, and that young Oxford student, the  colonels, and the ensigns, and that young Oxford student won't at all do;  officers are commonly worth nothing; and scholars, you may take my word for my word,  my dear, are the dullest men in the world. Besides, one would not give such a  fine fortune as Mr. Mandlebert's without making a little struggle for it. You  don't know how many pretty things you may do with it. So let us shew Miss Camilla us  don't want for spirit, and speak to Miss Camilla at once.'  These words, reviving in the mind of Indiana Miss Camilla wedding clothes, the train of  servants, and the new equipage, gave fresh pique to Miss Camilla provocation: but  finding some difficulty to overtake the fleet Camilla, whose pace kept measure  with Miss Camilla wish to avoid These words, reviving in the mind of Indiana her wedding clothes, the train of  servants, and the new equipage, Miss Camilla called after Miss Camilla, to desire Miss Camilla would not walk  so fast.  Miss Camilla reluctantly loitered, but without stopping or turning to meet These words, reviving in the mind of Indiana her wedding clothes, the train of  servants, and the new equipage,  that Miss Camilla might still regale Miss Camilla with the perfume of the geranium presented  Miss Camilla by Edgar.  'You're in great haste, ma'am,' said Miss Margland, 'which I own I did not  observe to be the case just now!'  Miss Camilla, in much surprize, asked, what Miss Camilla meant.  'My meaning is pretty plain, I believe, to any body that chose to understand  My meaning. However, though Miss Lynmere scorns to be Miss Lynmere own champion, I cannot, as a  friend, be quite so passive, nor help hinting to you, how little you would like  such a proceeding to you, from any other person.'  'What proceeding?' cried Miss Camilla, blushing, from a dawning comprehension of the  subject, though resenting the manner of the complaint.  'Nay, only ask you, ma'am, only ask you, Miss Miss Camilla, how you should  like to be so supplanted, if such an establishment were forming for yourself,  and every thing were fixt, and every body else refused, and nobody to hinder  its all taking place, but a near relation of your own, who ought to be the  first to help it forward. I should like to know, I say, Miss Camilla, how you  would feel, if it were your own case?'  Astonished and indignant at so sudden and violent an assault, Miss Camilla stood  suspended, whether to deign any vindication, or to walk silently away: yet its  implications involuntarily filled Miss Camilla with a thousand other, and less offending  emotions than those of anger, and a general confusion crimsoned Miss Camilla cheeks.  'You cannot but be sensible, ma'am,' resumed Margland, 'for sense is not  what you want, that you have seduced Mr. Mandlebert from your cousin; you  cannot but see Mr. Mandlebert takes hardly the smallest notice of Miss Camilla, from the pains you  are at to make Mr. Mandlebert admire nobody but yourself.'  The spirit of Miss Camilla now rose high to Miss Camilla aid, at a charge thus impertinent  and unjust. 'Margland,' Margland cried, 'you shock and amaze me! I am at a loss  for any motive to so cruel an accusation: but you, I hope at least, my dear  Indiana, are convinced how much my dear  Indiana injures me.' my dear  Indiana would then have taken the  hand of Indiana, but disdainfully drawing my dear  Indiana back, 'I shan't break my heart  about my dear  Indiana, I assure you,' my dear  Indiana cried, 'you are vastly welcome to Mr. Mandlebert for my dear  Indiana; I  hope I am not quite so odious, but I may find other people in the world besides  Mr. Mandlebert!'  'O, as to that,' said Margland, 'I am sure you have only to look in order  to chuse; but since this affair has been settled by your uncle, I can't say I  think this affair very grateful in any person to try to overset your uncle particular wishes.  Poor old gentleman! I'm sure I pity your uncle! It will go hard enough with your uncle, when  your uncle comes to hear It! Such a requital!—and from your uncle own niece!'  This was an attack the most offensive that Miss Camilla could receive; nothing could  so nearly touch Miss Camilla as an idea of ingratitude to your uncle, and resting upon  that, the whole tide of those feelings which were, in fact, divided and  subdivided into many crossing channels, Miss Camilla broke forth, with great eagerness,  into exclaiming, 'Margland, this is quite barbarous! You know, and you,  Indiana, cannot but know, I would not give your uncle the smallest pain, to be  mistress of a thousand universes!'  'Why, then,' said Margland, 'should you break up a scheme which your uncle has so  much set your uncle heart upon? Why are you always winning over Mr. Mandlebert to  yourself, by all that flattery? Why are you always consulting Mr. Mandlebert? always  obliging Mr. Mandlebert? always of Mr. Mandlebert opinion? always ready to take Mr. Mandlebert advice?'  'Miss Margland,' replied Camilla, with the extremest agitation, 'this is so  unexpected—so undeserved an interpretation,—my consultation, or my  acquiescence have been merely from respect; no other thought, no other  motive—Good God! what is it you imagine?—what guilt would you impute to me?'  'O dear,' cried Indiana, 'pray don't suppose it signifies. If you like to make  compliments in that manner to gentlemen, pray do it. I hope I shall always hold  me above it. I think it's their place to make compliments to me.'  A resentful answer was rising to the tongue of Miss Camilla, when Miss Camilla perceived Miss Camilla  two little sprigs, which in Miss Camilla recent disorder Miss Camilla had dropt, were demolishing  under the feet of Indiana, who, with apparent unmeaningness, but internal  suspicion of the feet of Indiana, who, with apparent unmeaningness, but internal  suspicion of their giver, had trampled upon them both giver, had trampled upon the feet of Indiana, who, with apparent unmeaningness, but internal  suspicion of their giver, had trampled upon them both both. Hastily stooping Miss Camilla  picked them both up, and, with evident vexation, was blowing from them both the dust and  dirt, when Indiana scoffingly said, 'I wonder where you got that geranium?'  'I don't wonder at all,' said Margland, 'for Sir Hugh has none of that  species; so one may easily guess.'  Miss Camilla felt Miss Camilla blush, and letting the flowers fall, turned to Indiana,  and said, 'Cousin, if on my account, it is possible you can suffer the smallest  uneasiness, tell me but what I shall do—you shall dictate to me—you shall  command me.'  Indiana disclaimed all interest in Miss Camilla behaviour; but Margland cried,  'What you can do, ma'am, is this, and nothing can be easier, nor fairer: leave  off paying all that court to Mr. Mandlebert, of asking Mr. Mandlebert advice, and follow  your own way, whether Mr. Mandlebert likes it or not, and go to see Mrs. Arlbery, and Mrs.  every body else, when you have a mind, without waiting for Mr. Mandlebert permission, or  troubling yourself about what Mr. Mandlebert thinks of it.'  Miss Camilla now trembled in every joint, and with difficulty restrained from tears,  while, timidly, Miss Camilla said—'And do you, my dear  Indiana, demand of me this  conduct? and will it, at least, satisfy you?'  'Me? O dear no! I demand nothing, I assure you. The whole matter is quite  indifferent to me, and you may ask Mr. Mandlebert leave for every thing in the world, if  you chuse  . There are people enough ready to take my part, I hope, if you set  Mr. Mandlebert against me ever so much.'  'Indeed, indeed, Indiana,' said Miss Camilla, overpowered with conflicting  sensations, 'this is using me very unkindly!' And, without waiting to hear  another word, Miss Camilla hurried into the house, and flew to hide Miss Camilla in Miss Camilla own  room.  This was the first bitter moment Miss Camilla had ever known. Peace, gay though uniform,  had been the constant inmate of Miss Camilla breast, enjoyed without thought, possessed  without struggle; not the subdued gift of accommodating philosophy, but the  inborn and genial produce of youthful felicity's best aliment, the energy of  its own animal spirits.  Miss Camilla had, indeed, for some time past, thought Edgar, of too refined and too  susceptible a character for the unthinking and undistinguishing Indiana; and  for the last day or two, Miss Camilla regret at his fate had strengthened his fate into an  averseness of his supposed destination, that made the idea of his fate painful, and  the subject repugnant to Miss Camilla; but Miss Camilla had never, till this very morning,  distrusted the innoxiousness either of Miss Camilla pity or Miss Camilla regard; and, startled at  the first surmise of danger, Miss Camilla had wished to fly even from Miss Camilla, rather  than venture to investigate feelings so unwelcome; yet still and invariably,  Miss Camilla had concluded Edgar the future husband of Indiana.  To hear there were any doubts of the intended marriage, filled Miss Camilla with  emotions indefinable; to hear Miss Camilla named as the cause of those doubts, was  alarming both to Miss Camilla integrity and Miss Camilla delicacy. Miss Camilla felt the extremest anger  at the unprovoked and unwarrantable harshness of Margland, and a  resentment nearly equal at the determined petulance, and unjustifiable  aspersions of Indiana.  Satisfied of the innocence of Miss Camilla intentions, Miss Camilla knew, not what alteration Miss Camilla  could make in Miss Camilla behaviour; and, after various plans, concluded, that to make  none would best manifest Miss Camilla freedom from self-reproach. At the summons  therefore to dinner, Miss Camilla was the first to appear, eager to shew Miss Camilla unmoved  by the injustice of Miss Camilla accusers, and desirous to convince her accusers Miss Camilla was  fearless of examination.  Yet, too much discomposed to talk in Miss Camilla usual manner, Miss Camilla seized upon a book  till the party was seated. Answering then to the call of Miss Camilla uncle, with as  easy an air as Miss Camilla could assume, Miss Camilla took Miss Camilla accustomed place by his side, and  began, for mere employment, filling a plate from the dish that was nearest to  Miss Camilla; which Miss Camilla gave to the footman, without any direction whither to carry, or  enquiry if any body chose to eat any body.  any body was taken round the table, and, though refused by all, Miss Camilla heaped up another  plate, with the same diligence and speed as if any body had been accepted.  Edgar, who had been accidentally detained, only now entered, apologizing for  being so late.  Engrossed by the pride of self-defence, and the indignancy of unmerited  unkindness, the disturbed mind of Miss Camilla had not yet formed one separate  reflexion, nor even admitted a distinct idea of Edgar , disengaged from  the accusation in which Edgar stood involved. But Edgar had now amply Edgar turn. The  moment Edgar appeared, the deepest blushes covered her face; and an emotion so  powerful beat in her , that the immediate impulse of her impetuous  feelings, was to declare her ill, and run out of the room.  With this view her rose; but ashamed of her plan, seated her the next  moment, though her had first overturned her plate and a sauce-boat in the  vehemence of her haste.  This accident rather recovered than disconcerted her, by affording an  unaffected occupation, in begging pardon of Sir Hugh, who was the chief  sufferer, changing the napkins, and restoring the table to order.  'What upon earth can be the matter with Miss Camilla, I can't guess!' exclaimed  Margland, though with an expression of spite that fully contradicted Margland  difficulty of conjecture.  'I hope,' said Edgar surprized, 'Miss Camilla Miss Camilla is not ill?'  'I can't say I think my cousin looks very bad!' said Indiana.  Camilla, who was rubbing a part of my cousin gown upon which nothing had fallen,  affected to be too busy to hear Camilla, who was rubbing a part of her gown upon which nothing had fallen: which Sir Hugh, concluding my cousin silent  from shame, entreated my cousin not to think of Sir Hugh cloaths, which were worth no  great matter, not being Sir Hugh best by two or three suits. my cousin thoughts had not  waited this injunction; yet this injunction was in vain my cousin strove to behave as if nothing  had happened. my cousin spirit instigated, but Her spirit would not support my cousin; my cousin voice  grew husky, my cousin stammered, forgot, as my cousin went on, what my cousin designed to say  when my cousin began speaking, and frequently was forced to stop short, with a faint  laugh at my cousin, and with a colour every moment encreasing. And the very  instant the cloth was removed, my cousin rose, unable to constrain my cousin any  longer, and ran up stairs to my cousin own room.  There all my cousin efforts evaporated in tears. 'Cruel, cruel, Margland,' my cousin  cried, 'unjust, unkind Indiana! how have I merited this treatment! What can  Edgar think of my disturbance? What can I devise to keep from Edgar knowledge the  barbarous accusation which has caused his knowledge?'  In a few minutes my cousin heard the step of Eugenia.  Ashamed, my cousin hastily wiped my cousin eyes; and before the door could be opened, was  at the further end of the room, looking into one of my cousin drawers.  'What is it that has vexed Miss CamillaMiss Camilla?' cried my cousin kind sister,  'something I am sure has grieved my cousin.'  'I cannot guess what I have done with—I can no where find—' stammered  Miss Camilla, engaged in some apparent search, but too much confused to name  anything of which Miss Camilla might probably be in want.  Eugenia desired to assist Eugenia, but a servant came to the door, to tell them  that the company was going to the summer-house, Sir Hugh begged them  would follow.  Miss Camilla besought Eugenia to join them, and make Eugenia excuses: but, fearing Miss  Margland would attribute Miss   absconding to guilt, or cowardice, Miss   bathed Miss    eyes in cold water, and overtook Miss   sister at the stairs of the little  building.  In ascending them, Miss   heard Margland say, 'I dare believe nothing's the  matter but some whim; for to be sure as to whims, Miss Camilla Miss Camilla has the most of  any creature I ever saw, and Miss Lynmere the least; for you may imagine, Mr.  Mandlebert, I have pretty good opportunity to see all these young people in  all these young people real colours.'  Overset by this malignancy, Miss   was again flying to the refuge of Miss   own room,  and the relief of tears, when the conviction of such positive ill-will in Miss  Margland, for which Miss   could assign no reason, but Miss   unjust and exclusive  partiality to Indiana, checked Miss   precipitancy. Miss   feared Miss   would construe  to still another whim Miss   non-appearance, and resuming a little fresh strength  from fresh resentment, turned back; but the various keen sensations Miss    experienced as Miss   entered the summer-house, rendered this little action the  most severe stretch of fortitude, Miss   short and happy life had yet called upon  Miss   to make.  Sir Hugh addressed Miss   some kind enquiries, which Miss   hastily answered, while  Miss   pretended to be busy in preparing to wind some sewing silk upon cards.  Miss   could have chosen no employment less adapted to display the cool  indifference Miss   wished to manifest to Miss Margland and Indiana. Miss   pulled  the silk the wrong way, twisted, twirled, and entangled the silk continually; and  while Miss   talked volubly of what Miss   was about, as if the silk were the sole subject  of Miss   thoughts, Miss   shaking hands shewed Miss   whole frame disordered, and Miss    high colour betrayed Miss   strong internal emotion.  Edgar looked at Miss   with surprize and concern. What had dropt from Miss  Margland of Miss   whims, Edgar had heard with disdain; for, without suspecting Miss    of malice to Miss Camilla, Edgar concluded Miss   warped by Miss   prejudice in favour of IndianaIndiana. Dr. Marchmont, however, had bid Dr. Marchmont judge by proof, not appearance;  and Dr. Marchmont resolved therefore to investigate the cause of this disquiet, before Dr. Marchmont  acted upon Dr. Marchmont belief in its blamelessness.  Having completely spoilt one skein, Miss   threw one skein aside, and saying 'the  weather's so fine, I cannot bear to stay within,'—left Miss   silk, Miss   winders,  and Miss   work-bag, on the first chair, and skipt down the stairs.  Sir Hugh declined walking, but would let nobody remain with Sir Hugh. Edgar, as if  studying the clouds, glided down first. Miss Camilla, perceiving Edgar, bent Miss Camilla head,  and began gathering some flowers. Edgar stood by Miss Camilla a moment in silence, and then  said: 'To-morrow morning, without fail, I will wait upon Mrs. Needham.'  'Pray take your own time. I am not in any haste.'  'You are very good, and I am more obliged to you than I can express, for  suffering my officious interference with such patience.'  A rustling of silk made Miss Camilla now look up, and Miss Camilla perceived Marglandleaning half out of the window of the summer-house, from earnestness to catch  what Miss Camilla said.  Angry thus to be watched, and persuaded that both innocence and dignity called  upon Miss Camilla to make no change in Miss Camilla open consideration for Edgar, Miss Camilla answered,  in a voice that strove to be more audible, but that irresistibly trembled, 'I  beg you will impartially consult your own judgment, and decide as you think  right.'  Edgar, now, became as little composed as Miss Camilla: the power with which Miss Camilla  invested Edgar, possessed a charm to dissolve every hesitating doubt; and when,  upon Miss Camilla raising Miss Camilla head, Edgar perceived the redness of Miss Camilla eyes, and found that  the perturbation which had perplexed Edgar was mingled with some affliction, the  most tender anxiety filled Edgar mind, and though somewhat checked by the  vicinity of Margland, Edgar voice expressed the warmest solicitude, as Edgar  said, 'I know not how to thank you for this sweetness; but I fear something  disturbs you?—I fear you are not well, or are not happy?'  Miss Camilla again bent over the flowers; but it was not to scent the flowers fragrance;  Miss Camilla sought only a hiding place for Miss Camilla eyes, which were gushing with tears; and  though Miss Camilla wished to fly a thousand miles off, Miss Camilla had not courage to take a  single step, nor force to trust Miss Camilla voice with the shortest reply.  'You will not speak? yet you do not deny that you have some uneasiness?—Could  I give it but the smallest relief, how fortunate I should think myself!—And  is it quite impossible?—Do you forbid me to ask what it is?—forbid me the  indulgence even to suggest——'  'Ask nothing! suggest nothing! and think of it no more!' interrupted Miss Camilla,  'if you would not make me quite——'  Miss Camilla stopt suddenly, not to utter the word unhappy, of which Miss Camilla felt the  improper strength at the moment it was quivering on Miss Camilla lips, and leaving Miss Camilla  sentence unfinished, abruptly walked away.  Edgar could not presume to follow, yet felt Miss Camilla conquest irresistible. Miss Camilla  self-denial with regard to Mrs. Arlbery won Mrs. Arlbery highest approbation; Miss Camilla  compliance with Mrs. Arlbery wishes convinced Mrs. Arlbery of Miss Camilla esteem; and Miss Camilla distress, so  new and so unaccountable, centered every wish of Mrs. Arlbery heart in a desire to  solace, and to revive Miss Camilla.  To obtain this privilege hastened at once and determined his measures; his  excused his, therefore, from walking, and went instantly to his chamber, to  reclaim, by a hasty letter to Dr. Marchmont, his procrastinating promise.
