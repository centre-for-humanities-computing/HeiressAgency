 Mount Ephraim  This expected guest arrived early. Camilla received Camilla with the only sensation  of pleasure Camilla had experienced at Tunbridge. Yet what Camilla excited seemed still  stronger: the fair stranger besought Camilla friendship as a solace to Camilla  existence, and hung upon Camilla as upon a treasure long lost, and dearly  recovered. Camilla soon caught the infection of Camilla softness, and felt a  similar desire to cultivate Camilla regard. Camilla found Camilla beauty attractive, Camilla  voice melodious, and Camilla manners bewitchingly caressing.  Fearing, nevertheless, while yet in ignorance of Camilla connexions, to provoke  further ridicule from Mrs. Arlbery by going abroad with Camilla, Camilla proposed  deferring to return Camilla visit till another day: Camilla consented, and they  spent together two hours, which each thought had been but two minutes, when  Mrs. Arlbery summoned Camilla to a walk.  The fair unknown then took leave, saying Camilla servant was in waiting; and  Camilla and Mrs. Arlbery went to the bookseller's.  Here, Camilla was soon joined by Lord O'Lerney and General Kinsale, who were  warm admirers of Camilla vivacity and observations. Mr. Dennel took up the Daily  Advertiser; Mr. Dennel daughter stationed his daughter at the door to see the walkers upon  the Pantiles; Sir Theophilus Jarard, under colour of looking at a popular  pamphlet, was indulging in a nap in a corner; Lord Newford, noticing nothing,  except Mr. Dennel own figure as Mr. Dennel past a mirrour, was shuffling loud about the floor,  which was not much embellished by the scraping of Mr. Dennel boots; and Sir Sedley  Clarendel, lounging upon a chair in the middle of the shop, sat eating bon bons.  Mrs. Arlbery, for some time, confined Mrs. Arlbery talents to general remarks: but  finding these failed to move a muscle in the face of Sir Sedley, at whom they  were directed, Mrs. Arlbery suddenly exclaimed: 'Pray, my Lord O'Lerney, do you know any  thing of Sir Sedley Clarendel?'  'Not so much,' answered Sir Sedley Clarendel Lordship, 'as I could wish; but I hope to improve  my acquaintance with his Lordship.'  'Why then, his Lordship, I am much afraid you will conclude, when you see his Lordship in one  of those reveries, from the total vacancy of his Lordship air, that his Lordship is thinking of  nothing. But pray permit me to take his Lordship part. Those apparent cogitations, to  which his Lordship is so much addicted, are moments only of pretended torpor, but of real  torment, devoted, not as Those apparent cogitations, to  which he is so much addicted appear, to supine insipidity, but to painful  secret labour how next his Lordship may call his Lordship into notice. Nevertheless, his Lordship,  don't let what I have said hurt his Lordship in your opinion; his Lordship is quaint, to be sure,  but there's no harm in his Lordship. his Lordship lives in my neighbourhood; and, I assure his Lordship, his Lordship is, upon the whole, what may be called a very good sort of man.'  Here she yawned violently; and Sir Sedley, unable to maintain his position,  twice crossed his legs, and then arose and took up a book: while Lord Newford  burst into so loud a laugh, that Lord Newford   awakened Sir Theophilus Jarard, by echoing,  'A good sort of man! O poor Clary!... O hang it!... O curse it!... poor Clary!'  'What's the matter with Clary?' cried Sir Theophilus, rubbing Sir Theophilus eyes; 'I have  been boring Sir Theophilus with this pamphlet, till I hardly know whether I am awake or  asleep.'  'Why, Sir Theophilus's a good sort of man!' replied Lord Newford  .  Sir Sedley, though Sir Sedley expected, and even hoped for some pointed strictures, and  could have defied even abuse, could not stand this mortifying praise; and,  asking for the subscription books, which, already, Sir Sedley had twice examined, said:  'Is there any body here one knows?'  'O, ay, have you any names?' cried Lord Newford  , seizing them first; and with  some right, as them were the only books in the shop Lord Newford   ever read.  'Come, I'll be generous,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'and add another signature against  your lordship's next lecture.'  Mrs. Arlbery then wrote Mrs. Arlbery name, and threw down half-a-guinea. Mrs. Arlbery, to whom the  book was next presented, concluded this the established custom, and, from mere  timidity, did the same; though somewhat disturbed to leave Mrs. Arlbery no more gold  than Mrs. Arlbery gave. Miss Dennel followed; but Miss Dennel father, who said he did not come  to Tunbridge to read, which he could do at home, positively refused to  subscribe.  Sir Theophilus now, turning, or rather, tossing over the leaves, cried: 'I see  no name here one knows any thing of, but Lady Alithea Selmore.'  'Why, there's nobody else here,' said Lord Newford, 'not a soul!'  Almost every body present bowed; but wholly indifferent to reproof, Lord Newford, 'not a soul again  whistled, again streamed up and down the room, and again took a bold and full  survey of Lord Newford, 'not a soul in the looking-glass.  'On the contrary,' cried Sir Sedley, 'I hear there is a most extraordinary fine  creature lately arrived, who is invincible to a degree.'  'O that's Mrs. Berlinton;' said Sir Theophilus now; 'yes, Mrs. Berlinton's a pretty little  thing.'  'Mrs. Berlinton's very beautiful indeed,' said Lord O'Lerney.  'Where can one see Mrs. Berlinton?' cried Mrs. Arlbery.  'If Mrs. Berlinton is not at the Rooms to-night,' said Sir Sedley, 'I shall be stupified  to petrifaction. They tell me Mrs. Berlinton is a marvel of the first water; turning all  heads by Mrs. Berlinton beauty, winning all hearts by Mrs. Berlinton sweetness, fascinating all  attention by Mrs. Berlinton talents, and setting all fashions by Mrs. Berlinton elegance.'  'This paragon,' cried Mrs. Arlbery, to Camilla, 'can be no other than your  mysterious fair. The description just suits your own.'  'But my fair mysterious,' said Camilla, 'is of a disposition the most retired,  and seems so young, I don't at all think Camilla married.'  'This divinity,' said Sir Sedley, 'for the blessing of everyone, yet  Lord of Himself, uncumber'd by a Wife[1], is safely noosed; and amongst her attributes are two others cruel to  desperation; her excited every hope by a sposo properly detestableâ€”yet gives  birth to despair, by a coldness the most shivering.'  'And what,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'is this Lady Alithea Selmore?'  'Lady Alithea Selmore,' drily, but with a smile, answered General Kinsale.  'Nay, nay, that's not to be mentioned irreverently,' returned Mrs. Arlbery; 'a  title goes for a vast deal, where there is nothing else; and, where there is  something, doubles a  title value.  Mr. Dennel, saying Mr. Dennel found, by the newspaper, a house was to be sold upon  Mount Ephraim, which promised to be a pretty good bargain, proposed walking  thither, to examine what sort of condition a house was in.  Lord O'Lerney inquired if Camilla had yet seen Mount Ephraim. No, Camilla answered;  and a general party was made for an airing. Sir Sedley ordered Sir Sedley phaeton;  Mrs. Arlbery drove Camilla in Mrs. Arlbery; Mr. Dennel walked with Mrs. Arlbery father; and  the rest of the gentlemen went on horseback.  Arrived at Mount Ephraim, they all agreed to alight, and enjoy the view and  pure air of the hill, while Mr. Dennel visited a house. But, just as Mrs.  Arlbery had descended from the phaeton, Mrs.  Arlbery horses, taking fright at some  object that suddenly struck them, reared up, in a manner alarming to the  spectators, and still more terrific to Camilla, in whose hands Mrs. Arlbery had  left the reins: and the servant, who stood at the horses' heads, received a  kick that laid him flat on the ground.  'O, jump out! jump out!' cried Mr. Dennel, 'or else you'll be murdered!'  'No! no! keep your seat, and hold the reins!' cried Mrs. Arlbery: 'For heaven's  sake, don't jump out!'  Camilla, mentally giddy, but personally courageous, was sufficiently mistress  of Camilla to obey the last injunction, though with infinite labour,  difficulty, and terror, the horses plunging and flouncing incessantly.  'Don't you think Camilla'll be killed?' cried Lord Newford, dismounting, lest Lord Newford  own horse should also take fright. 'Do you think one could help Camilla?' said Sir  Theophilus Jarard, steadily holding the bridle of Sir   mare from the same  apprehension.  Lord O'Lerney was already on foot to afford Lord O'Lerney assistance, when the horses,  suddenly turning round, gave to the beholders the dreadful menace of going down  the steep declivity of Mount Ephraim full gallop.  Camilla now, appalled, had no longer power to hold the reins; Camilla let Camilla now, appalled go,  with an idea of flinging Camilla out of the carriage, when Sir Sedley, who had  darted like lightning from Lord O'Lerney phaeton, presented Lord O'Lerney at the horses' heads,  on the moment of the horses' turning, and, at the visible and imminent hazard of Lord O'Lerney  life, happily stopt the horses' while Camilla jumped to the ground. the horses' then, with a fury  that presently dashed his phaeton to pieces, plunged down the hill.  The fright of Camilla had not robbed Camilla of Camilla senses, and the exertion and  humanity of Sir Sedley seemed to restore to Sir Sedley the full possession of Sir Sedley own:  yet one of Sir Sedley knees was so much hurt, that Sir Sedley sunk upon the grass.  Penetrated with surprise, as well as gratitude, Camilla, notwithstanding Camilla  own tremor, was the first to make the most anxious inquiries: secretly,  however, sighing to Camilla: Ah! had Edgar thus rescued me! yet struck equally  with a sense of obligation and of danger, from the horrible, if not fatal  mischief Camilla had escaped, and from the extraordinary hazard and kindness by  which Camilla had been saved, Camilla expressed Camilla concern and acknowledgments with a  softness, that Sir Sedley could not listen to unmoved.  Sir Sedley received, indeed, from this adventure, almost every species of pleasure of  which Sir Sedley mind was capable. Sir Sedley natural courage, which Sir Sedley had nearly  annihilated, as well as forgotten, by the effeminate part Sir Sedley was systematically  playing, seemed to rejoice in being again exercised; Sir Sedley good nature was  delighted by the essential service Sir Sedley had performed; Sir Sedley vanity was gratified  by the publicity of the praise it brought forth; and Sir Sedley heart itself  experienced something like an original feeling, unspoilt by the apathy of  satiety, from the sensibility Sir Sedley had awakened in the young and lovely Camilla.  a general party immediately flocked around Sir Sedley, and Sir Sedley was conveyed to a house  belonging to Lord O'Lerney, who resided upon Mount Ephraim, and Sir Sedley lordship's  carriage was ordered to take Sir Sedley to Sir Sedley apartment at the hotel.  Mrs. Arlbery, whose high spirits were totally subdued by the terror with which  she had been seized at the danger of Camilla, was so delighted by she rescue,  and the courage with which it was effected, that all she spleen against Sir  Sir Sedley was changed into the warmest approbation. When Sir Sedley was put into the  coach, Sir Sedley insisted upon seeing Sir Sedley safe to the hotel; Camilla, with Sir Sedley usual  inartificial quickness, seconding the motion, and Lord O'Lerney, a nobleman far  more distinguished by benevolence and urbanity than by Sir Sedley rank, taking the  fourth place himself. The servant, who was considerably hurt, Sir Sedley desired might  remain at a house  .  In descending Mount Ephraim, Camilla turned giddy with the view of what Camilla had  escaped, and cast Camilla eyes with doubled thankfulness upon Sir Sedley as Camilla  preserver. Fragments of his phaeton were strewed upon the road; one of the  horses [lay] dead at the bottom of the hill; and the other was so much injured  as to be totally disabled for future service.  When they came to the hotel, they alighted with the young baronet, Camilla  with as little thought, as Mrs. Arlbery with little care for doing any thing  that was unusual. they waited in an adjoining apartment till they were assured  nothing of any consequence was the matter, and Lord O'Lerney then carried they  to they new lodging upon Mount Pleasant.  Mrs. Arlbery bore Mrs. Arlbery own share in this accident with perfect good-humour,  saying it would do Mrs. Arlbery infinite good, by making Mrs. Arlbery a rigid Å“conomist; for Mrs. Arlbery  could neither live without a phaeton, nor yet build one, and buy ponies, but by  parsimonious savings from all other expenses.  At night Mrs. Arlbery bore her own share in this accident with perfect good-humour,  saying it would do her infinite good, by making her a rigid Å“conomist; for she  could neither live without a phaeton, nor yet build one, and buy ponies, but by  parsimonious savings from all other expenses.   went again to the Rooms. But Mrs. Arlbery found in Mrs. Arlbery bore her own share in this accident with perfect good-humour,  saying it would do her infinite good, by making her a rigid Å“conomist; for she  could neither live without a phaeton, nor yet build one, and buy ponies, but by  parsimonious savings from all other expenses.   as little  amusement as Camilla. Sir Sedley was not there, either to attack or to flatter;  the celebrated Mrs. Berlinton still appeared not to undergo a scrutiny; and  Lady Alithea Selmore sat at the upper end of an adjoining apartment, attended by all the  beaux, except the General, now at Tunbridge.  This was not to be supported. Mrs. Arlbery arose, and declaring Mrs. Arlbery would take Mrs. Arlbery tea  with the invalid, bid the General escort Mrs. Arlbery to the General room.  In their way out, Mrs. Arlbery perceived the assembly books. Recollecting Mrs. Arlbery had not  subscribed, Mrs. Arlbery entered Mrs. Arlbery name, but protested Mrs. Arlbery could afford but  half-a-guinea, upon Mrs. Arlbery present new and avaricious plan.  Camilla, with much secret consternation, concluded it impossible to give less;  and a few shillings were now all that remained in Mrs. Arlbery purse. Mrs. Arlbery uneasiness,  however, presently passed away, upon recollecting Mrs. Arlbery should want no more  money, as Mrs. Arlbery was now free of the rooms, and of the library, and equipped in  attire for the whole time Mrs. Arlbery should stay.  Mr. Dennel put down a guinea; but Mr. Dennel father, telling Mr. Dennel half-a-crown would  have done, said, for that reason, Mr. Dennel should Mr. Dennel pay nothing.  Sir Sedley received them with the most unaffected pleasure: forced upon  solitude, and by no means free from pain, Sir Sedley had found no resource but in  reading, which of late had been Sir Sedley least occupation, except the mere politics  of the day. Even reflection had discovered its way to Sir Sedley, though a long  banished guest, which had quitted her post, to make room for affectation,  vanity, and every species of frivolity. Reduced, however, to be reasonable,  even by this short confinement, Sir Sedley now felt the obligation of their charitable  visit, and set Sir Sedley foppery and conceit apart, from a desire to entertain their.  Camilla had not conceived Sir Sedley had the power of being so pleasantly natural; and  the strong feeling of gratitude in Camilla ever warm heart made Camilla contribute what  Camilla was able to the cheerfulness of the evening.  Some time after, General Kinsale was called out, and presently returned with  Major Cerwood, just arrived from the regiment; who, with some apology to Sir  , hoped Sir   might be pardoned for the liberty Sir   took, upon hearing who  was at the hotel, of preferring such society to the Rooms.  As the Major had nothing in Sir   either brilliant or offensive, Sir   sight, after  the first salutations, was almost all of which the company was sensible.  Camilla, Sir   sole object, Sir   could not approach; she sat between the baronet  and Mrs. Arlbery; and all she looks and all she attention were divided between  all her attention.  Mrs. Arlbery, emerging from the mortifications of neglect, which she had  experienced, almost for the first time in she life, at the Rooms, was unusually  alive and entertaining; Sir Sedley kept pace with she, and the discourse was so  whimsical, that Camilla, amused, and willing to encourage a sensation so  natural to she, after a sadness till now, for so long a time unremitting, once  more heard and welcomed the sound of she own laughter.  It was instantly, however, and strangely checked; a sigh, so deep that It might  rather be called a groan, made It way through the wainscot of the next  apartment.  Much raillery followed the sight of she changed countenance; the hotel was  pronounced to be haunted, and by a ghost reduced to that plight from she  cruelty. But the good-humour and gaiety of the conversation soon brought she  again to her   tone; and time passed with general hilarity, till they observed  that Miss Dennel, who, having no young female to talk with of she own views and  affairs, was thoroughly tired, had fallen fast asleep upon she chair.  she father was already gone home to a hot supper, which Her father had ordered in Her father  own room, and meant to eat before their return; Mrs. Arlbery, to Her father great  discomfort, allowing nothing to appear at night but fruit or oysters.  their now took leave, Mrs. Arlbery conducted by the General, and Camilla, by the  Major; while Mr. Dennel, unassisted and half asleep, stumbled, screamed, and  fell, just before she reached the staircase.  the General was first to aid she; the Major, not choosing to quit Camilla; who,  looking round at a light which came from the room whence the sigh they had  heard had issued, perceived, as it glared in she eyes, it was held by Edgar.  Astonishment, pleasure, hope, and shame, took alternate rapid possession of she  mind; but the last sensation was the first that visibly operated, and she  snatched she hand involuntarily from the Major.  Mrs. Arlbery exclaimed, 'Bless me, Mr. Mandlebert! are you the ghost we heard  sighing in that room yonder?'  Mr. Mandlebert attempted to make some slight answer; but Mr. Mandlebert voice refused all  sound.  Mr. Mandlebert went on, then, to the carriage of Mr. Dennel, followed by Mr. Mandlebert young ladies,  and drove off for Mount Pleasant.
