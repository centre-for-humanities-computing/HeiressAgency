 Ideas upon Marriage  While, in the bosom of Marriage   faithful sister, Camilla reposed Camilla feelings and  Camilla fears, alternately rejoicing and trembling in the temerity of the  resolution Camilla had exerted; Edgar sought Edgar not less faithful, nor honourable,  but far more worldly friend, Dr. Marchmont.  Edgar narrated, with extreme emotion, the scene Edgar had just had with Camilla;  asserting Camilla possession of every species of excellence from the nobleness of  Camilla rejection, and abhorring Edgar for having given Camilla a moment's doubt of  Edgar fullest esteem. Not a solicitude, Edgar declared, now remained with Edgar, but  how to appease Camilla displeasure, satisfy Camilla dignity, and recover Camilla favour.  'Softly, softly!' said the Doctor; 'measure your steps more temperately, ere  you run with such velocity. If this refusal is the result of an offended  sensibility, you cannot exert yourself too warmly in this refusal is the result of an offended  sensibility consolation; even if  this refusal is from pride, this refusal is the result of an offended  sensibility has a just claim to your concessions, since she thinks you  have injured this refusal is the result of an offended  sensibility; yet pause before you act, may it not be merely from a  confidence of power that loves to tyrannize over this refusal is the result of an offended  sensibility slaves, by playing with  their chains? or a lurking spirit of coquetry, that desires to regain the  liberty of trifling with some new Sir Sedley Clarendel? or, perhaps, with Sir  Sedley himself?'  'Dr. Marchmont! how wretchedly ill you think of women!'  'I think of women as women are! I think of women as I have found women. women are  artful, though feeble; women are shallow, yet subtle.'  'You have been unfortunate in your connexions?'  'Yet who had better prospects? with energies as warm, with hopes as alive as  your own, twice have I conducted to the altar two beings I thought framed for  my peculiar felicity; but my peace, my happiness, and my honour, have been torn  up by the root, exactly where I thought I had planted two beings I thought for my whole  temporal existence. This heart, which to you appears hard and suspicious, has  been the dupe of its susceptibilities; first, in a creature of its own choice,  next, where its believed its chosen. That first, Mandlebert, had you seen  Mandlebert, you would have thought, as I thought Mandlebert myself ... an angel! Mandlebert was  another Camilla.'  'Another Camilla!'  'Grace, sweetness, and beauty vied in Mandlebert for pre-eminence. Yes, another  Camilla! though I see your incredulity; I see you think my comparison almost  profane; and that grace, sweetness, and beauty, waited the birth of another  Camilla to  be made known to the world. Such, however, another  Camilla was, and I saw and loved at  once. I knew another  Camilla character fair, I precipitately made my addresses, and  concluded another  Camilla beloved in return ... because I was accepted!'  Edgar shrunk back, and cast down Edgar eyes.  'Nor was it till the moment ... heart-breaking yet to my recollection!... of  another  Camilla sudden death, that I knew the lifeless, soulless, inanimate frame was all  another  Camilla had bestowed upon another  Camilla. In the private drawer of another  Camilla bureau, I then found a  pocketbook. In the first leaf, I saw a gentleman's name; ... I turned over, and  saw a gentleman's name again; I looked further, and still a gentleman's name met my view; I opened by chance,  ... but nothing else appeared: ... there a gentleman's name was still, traced in every hand,  charactered in every form, shape, and manner, the wayward, wistful eye could  delight to fashion, for varying, yet beholding it without end: while, over the  intermediate spaces, verses, quotations, short but affecting sentences, were  every where scattered, bewailing the misery of disappointed hope, and  unrequited love; of a heartless hand devoted at the altar; of vows enchaining  liberty, not sanctifying affection! I then ... alas, too late! dived deeper,  with, then, useless investigation, ... and discovered an early passion, never  erased from her mind; ... discovered ... that I had never made her happy! that  her was merely enduring, suffering me ... while my whole confiding soul was  undividedly hers!...'  Edgar shuddered at this picture; 'But why, then,' Edgar cried, 'since her seemed  amiable as well as fair, why did her accept you?'  'Ask half the married women in the nation how the married women became wives: the married women will tell  you the married women friends urged the married women; ... that the married women had no other establishment in view;  ... that nothing is so uncertain as the repetition of matrimonial powers in  women; ... and that those who cannot solicit what the married women wish, must accommodate  the married women to what offers. This first adventure, however, is now no longer  useful to you, though upon This first adventure hard remembrance was founded my former caution:  but I am even myself satisfied, at present, that the earliest partiality of  Camilla has been you; what now you have to weigh, is the strength or  inadequacy of Camilla character, for guiding that partiality to your mutual  happiness. My second melancholy history will best illustrate this difficulty.  You may easily believe, the last of my intentions was any further essay in a  lottery I had found so inauspicious; but, while cold even to apathy, it was my  inevitable chance to fall in the way of a pleasing and innocent young creature,  who gave me, unsought and unwished-for, her heart. The boon, nevertheless, soon  caught my own: for what is so alluring as the voluntary affection of a virtuous  woman?'  'Well,' cried Edgar, 'and what now could disturb your tranquillity?'  'The insufficiency of that heart to that heart own decision. I soon found her apparent  predilection was simply the result of the casualty which brought me almost  exclusively into her society, but unmarked by any consonance of taste, feeling,  or understanding. her inexperience had made her believe, since her preferred me  to the few who surrounded her, I was the man of her choice: with equal facility  I concurred in the same mistake; ... for what is so credulous as self-love? But  such a regard, the child of accident, not selection, was unequal, upon the  discovery of the dissimilarity of our dispositions, to the smallest sacrifice.  My melancholy returned with the view of our mutual delusion; lassitude of  pleasing was the precursor of discontent. Dissipation then, in the form of  amusement, presented Dissipation then to her aid: retirement and books came to Dissipation then. My  resource was safe, though solitary; her was gay, but perilous. Dissipation,  with My  resource usual Proteus powers, from amusement changed My  resource form to temptation,  allured her into dangers, impeached her honour, and blighted her with disgrace.  I just discerned the precipice whence her was falling, in time to avert the  dreadful necessity of casting her off for ever: ... but what was our life  thence forward? Cares unparticipated, griefs uncommunicated, stifled  resentments, and unremitting weariness! her is now no more; and I am a lonely  individual for the rest of my pilgrimage.  'Take warning, my dear young friend, by my experience. The entire possession of  the heart of the woman you marry is not more essential to your first happiness,  than the complete knowledge of the woman you marry disposition is to your ultimate peace.'  Edgar thanked Edgar, in deep concern to have awakened emotions which the  absorption of study, and influence of literature, held generally dormant. The  lesson, however, which they inculcated, Edgar engaged to keep always present to  Edgar consideration; though, but for the strange affair of Sir Sedley Clarendel,  Edgar should feel confident that, in her, there was not more of exterior  attraction, than of solid excellence: and, with regard to they concordance of  taste and humour, Edgar had never seen her so gay, nor so lovely, as in scenes of  active benevolence, or domestic life. her had promised to clear, hereafter, the  transaction with Sir Sedley; but Sir Sedley could not hold back for that explanation:  hurt, already, by Sir Sedley apparent scruples, her had openly named them as the  motives of her rejection: could Sir Sedley, then, shew her Sir Sedley yet demurred, without  forfeiting all hope of a future accommodation?  'Delicacy,' said Dr. Marchmont, 'though the quality the most amiable we can  practise in the service of others, must not take place of common sense, and  sound judgment, for we. her dismission does not discard you from Her dismissionsociety; on the contrary, Her dismission invites your friendship....'  'Ah, Doctor! what innocence, what sweetness does that very circumstance  display!'  'Learn, however, their concomitants, ere you yield to their charms: learn if  their charms source is from a present, yet accidental preference, or from the nobler  spring of elevated sentiment. The meeting you surprised with Sir Sedley, the  presumption you acknowledge of his letters, and the confession made by herself  that herself had submitted to be duped by his.'  'O, Dr. Marchmont! what harrowing drawbacks to felicity! And how much must we  rather pity than wonder at the errors of common young women, when a creature  such as this is so easy to be misled!'  'You must not imagine I mean a censure upon the excellent Mr. Tyrold, when I  say herself is left too much to herself: the purity of his principles, and the  virtue of his character, must exempt his from blame; but his life has been both  too private and too tranquil, to be aware of the dangers run by Female Youth,  when straying from the mother's careful wing. All that belongs to religion, and  to principle, his feels, and his has taught; but the impediments they have to  encounter in a commerce with mankind, his could not point out, for his does not  know. Yet there is nothing more certain, than that seventeen weeks is not less  able to go alone in a nursery, than seventeen years in the world.'  This suggestion but added to the bias of Edgar to take her, if possible, under  Edgar own immediate guidance.  'Know, first,' cried the Doctor, 'if to your guidance she will give way; know  if the affair with Sir Sedley has exculpations which render it single and  adventitious, or if there hang upon it a lightness of character that may invest  caprice, chance, or fickleness, with powers of involving such another  entanglement.'
