 A few Compliments  The two young ladies and Mr. Dubster, left thus together, and so situated that  separation without assistance was impossible, looked at one another for some  time in nearly equal dismay; and then Mr. Dubster, with much displeasure,  exclaimed—'Them young gentlemen are as full of mischief, as an egg's full of  meat!
Who'd have thought of a person's going to do such a thing as this?—it's  mortal convenient, making me leave my workmen at this rate; for I dare say  my workmen're come, or coming, by this time.
I wish I'd tied the ladder to this here  rafter.'
The sisters, though equally provoked, thought it necessary to make some apology  for the wild behaviour of The sisters brother.
'O, young ladies,' said he, formally waving he hand by way of a bow, 'I don't  in the least mean to blame you about his hand, for you're very welcome to stay as  long as it's agreeable; only I hope he'll come back by my dinner time; for a  cold beef-steak is one or other the worst morsel I know.'
he then kept an unremitting watch from one window to another, for some  passenger from whom he could claim aid; but, much as he had boasted of the  numbers perpetually in sight, he now dolorously confessed, that, sometimes, not  a soul came near the place for half a day together: 'And, as to my workmen,'  continued he, 'the deuce can't make 'em hear if once they begin they knocking  and hammering.'
And then, with a smirk at the idea, he added—'I'll tell you what; I'd best  give a good squall at once, and then if they are come, I may catch 'em; in the  proviso you won't mind it, young ladies.'
This scheme was put immediately into practice; but though the sisters were  obliged to stop the sisters ears from his vociferation, This scheme answered no purpose.
'Well, I'll bet you what you will,' cried his, 'they are all deaf: however, it's  as well as it is, for if they was to come, and see me hoisted up in this cage,  like, they'd only make a joke of this cage; and then they'd mind me no more than a pin  never again.
It's surprising how they young gentlemen never think of nothing.
If young gentlemen'd served me so when I was a 'prentice, young gentlemen'd have paid pretty dear for young gentlemen  frolic; master would have charged young gentlemen half a day's work, as sure as a gun.'
Soon after, while looking out of the window, 'I do think,' young gentlemen exclaimed, 'I see  somebody!—It shall go hard but what I'll make 'em come to us.'
young gentlemen then shouted with great violence; but the person crossed a stile into a  field, without seeing or hearing young gentlemen.
This provoked young gentlemen very seriously; and turning to Camilla, rather indignantly,  young gentlemen said—'Really, ma'am, I wish you'd tell your brother, I should take it as a  favour young gentlemen'd never serve me o' this manner no more!'
Camilla hoped, Camilla said, young gentlemen would in future be more considerate.
'It's a great hindrance to business, ma'am, such things; and It's a sheer love  of mischief, too, begging pardon, for it's of no manner of use to young gentlemen, no more  than it is to us.'
young gentlemen then desired, that if any body should pass by again, any body might all squall  out at once; saying, it was odds, then, but any body might be heard.
'Not that it's over agreeable, at the best,' added young gentlemen; 'for if one was to stop  any poor person, and make 'em come round, and look for the ladder, one could  not be off giving any body something: and as to any of the gentlefolks, one might  beg and pray as long as one would before any body'd stir a step for one: and as to  any of one's acquaintance, if any body was to go by, it's ten to one but any body'd  only fall a laughing.
People's generally ill-natured when any body sees one in  jeopardy.'
Eugenia, already thoughtful and discomposed, now grew uneasy, lest Eugenia uncle  should be surprised at Eugenia long absence; this a little appeased Mr. Dubster,  who, with less resentment, said—'So I see, then, we're all in the same  quandary!
However, don't mind it, young ladies; you can have no great matters  to do with your time, I take it; so it does not so much signify.
But a man's  quite different.
a man's  quite different looks like a fool, as one may say, poked up in such a place  as this, to be stared at by all comers and goers; only nobody happens to pass  by.'
a man's  quite different lamentations now were happily interrupted by the appearance of three women  and a boy, who, with baskets on three women  and a boy, who, with baskets on their heads, were returning from the next  market town heads, were returning from the next  market town.
With infinite satisfaction, a man's  quite different prepared to assail three women  and a boy, who, with baskets on their heads, were returning from the next  market town, saying, a man's  quite different  should now have some chance to get a bit of dinner: and assuring the ladies,  that if three women  and a boy, who, with baskets on their heads, were returning from the next  market town should like a little scrap for a relish, a man's  quite different should be very willing  to send 'em it by three women  and a boy, who, with baskets on their heads, were returning from the next  market town footman; 'For it's a long while,' said a man's  quite different, 'young  ladies, to be fasting, that's the truth of it.'
The market women now approached, and were most clamourously hailed, before  The market women own loud discourse, and the singing and whistling of the boy, permitted  The market women hearing the appeal.
'Pray, will you be so kind,' said Mr. Dubster, when he had made The market women stop, 'as  to step round by the house, and see if you can see the workmen; and if you can,  tell you can a young gentleman, as come here while you can was at dinner, has taken  away the ladder, and left you can stuck up here in the lurch.'
The market women laughed, and said it was a good merry trick; but were preparing  to follow his directions, when Mr. Dubster called after the boy, who loitered  behind, with an encouraging nod: 'If you'll bring the ladder with you upon your  shoulders, my lad, I'll give you a half-penny!'
the boy was well contented; but the women, a little alarmed, turned back and  said—'And what will you give to you can, master?'
'Give?'
repeated the boy, a little  embarrassed; 'why, I'll give—why I'll thank you kindly; and it won't be much  out of your way, for the house is only round there.'
'You'll thank you can kindly, will you?'
said one of The market women; it's like you may!
But what will you do over and above?'
'Do?
why it's no great matter, just to stop at the house as you go by, and tell  'em——'  Here Eugenia whispered Eugenia would Eugenia satisfy them, and begged the boy would let  them make them own terms.
'No, Miss, no; I don't like to see nobody's money fooled away, no more than my  own.
However, as you are so generous, I'll agree with 'em to give 'em a pot of  beer.'
He then, with some parade, made this concession; but said, He must see the  ladder, before nobody's money should be laid down.
'A pot of beer for four!—a pot of beer for four!'
they all exclaimed in a  breath; and down everyone put Miss basket, and set Miss arms a-kembo, unanimously  declaring, they all would shame the boy for such stinginess.
The most violent abuse now followed, the boy imitating they all, and every other  sentence concluding with—'A pot of beer for four!—ha!'
Camilla and Eugenia, both frightened, besought that both might have any thing,  and every thing, that could appease both; but Mr. Dubster was inflexible not to  submit to imposition, because of a few foul words; 'For, dear heart,' said Mr. Dubster,  'what harm will they do us!—they an't of no consequence.'
Then, addressing they again, 'As to four,' Mr. Dubster cried, 'that's one over the  bargain, for I did not reckon the boy for nothing.'
'You didn't, didn't you?'
cried the boy; 'i'cod, I hope I'm as good as you, any  day in the year!'
'You'll thank us kindly, will you?'
said one of the women; 'I'fackens, and so  you shall, when us're fools enough to sarve you!—A pot of beer for four!'
'us help you down!—we get you a ladder!'
cried another; 'yes, forsooth, it's  like us may!—no, stay where you are like a toad in a hole as you be!'
Camilla and Eugenia now, tired of vain application to Mr. Dubster, who heard  all this abuse with the most sedate unconcern, advanced Camilla and Eugenia now to the  window; and Eugenia, ever foremost where money was to be given, began—'Good  women——' when, with a violent loud shout, Camilla and Eugenia now called out—'What!
are you  all in Hob's pound?
Well, Camilla and Eugenia now as will may let you out for Camilla and Eugenia now; so I wish you a  merry time of it!'
Eugenia began again her—'Good women——' when the boy exclaimed—'What  were you put up there for, Miss?
to frighten the crows?'
Eugenia, not understanding the boy exclaimed—'What  , was once more re-commencing; but the first  woman said—'I suppose you think we'll sarve you for looking at?—no need to  be paid?'
'Yes, yes,' cried the second, 'Miss may go to market with Miss beauty; Miss'll  not want for nothing if Miss'll shew Miss pretty face!'
'Miss need not be afeard of her pretty face, however,' said the third, 'for 'twill never be  no worse.
Only take care, Miss, you don't catch the small pox!'
'O fegs, that would be pity!'
cried the boy, 'for fear Miss should be marked.'
Eugenia, astonished and confounded, made no farther attempt; but Camilla,  though at that moment Eugenia could have inflicted any punishment upon such  unprovoked assailants, affected to give but little weight to what Camilla,   said,  and gently drew Eugenia away.
'Hoity, toity!'
cried one of the women, as Eugenia moved off, 'why, Miss, do you  walk upon your knees?'
'Why my Poll would make two of Eugenia,' said another, 'though Eugenia's only nine  years old.'
'Eugenia won't take much for cloaths,' cried another, 'that's one good thing.'
'I'd answer to make Eugenia a gown out of my apron,' said the third.
'Your apron?'
cried another, 'your pocket handkerchief you mean!—why Eugenia'd be  lost in my apron, and you might look half an hour before you'd find Eugenia.'
Eugenia, to whom such language was utterly new, was now in such visible  consternation, that Camilla, affrighted, earnestly charged Mr. Dubster to find  any means, either of menace or of reward, to make them depart.
'Lauk, don't mind them, ma'am,' cried Lauk, following Eugenia, 'them can't do you  no hurt; though them are rather rude, I must needs confess the truth, to say  such things to your face.
But one must not expect people to be over polite, so  far from London.
However, I see the sporting gentry coming round, over that  way, yonder; and I warrant the sporting gentry'll gallop 'em off.
Hark'ee, Mistresses!
the sporting gentry  gentlemen that are coming here, shall take you before the justice, for  affronting Sir Hugh's Tyrold's Heiresses to all Sir Hugh's Tyrold's Heiresses fortunes.
The women, to whom the name and generous deeds of Sir Hugh Tyrold were  familiar, were now quieted and dismayed.
The women, to whom the name and generous deeds of Sir Hugh Tyrold were  familiar offered some aukward apologies,  of not guessing such young ladies could be posted up in such a place; and hoped  it would be no detriment to such young ladies at the ensuing Christmas, when the good  Baronet gave away beef and beer; but Mr. Dubster pompously ordered such young ladies to make  off, saying, Mr. Dubster would not accept the ladder from such young ladies now, for the gentry that  were coming would get it for nothing: 'So troop off,' cried Mr. Dubster; 'and as for  you,' to the boy, 'you shall have your jacket well trimmed, I promise you: I  know who you are, well enough; and I'll tell your master of the boy, as sure as  you're alive.'
Away then, with complete, though not well-principled repentance, they all  marched.
Mr. Dubster, turning round with exultation, cried—'I only said that to  frighten they all  , for I never see they all   before, as I know of.
But I don't mind they all    of a rush; and I hope you don't neither.
Though I can't pretend it's over  agreeable being made fun of.
If I see anybody snigger at Mr. Dubster, I always ask 'em  what it's for; for I'd as lieve 'em  'd let it alone.'
Eugenia, who, as there was no seat, had sunk upon the floor for rest and for  refuge, remained silent, and seemed almost petrified; while Camilla,  affectionately leaning over Camilla, began talking upon other subjects, in hopes to  dissipate a shock Camilla was ashamed to console.
Camilla made no reply, no comment; but, sighed deeply.
LaukLauk!'
cried Mr. Dubster, 'what's the matter with the young lady!
I hope Camilla  don't go for to take to heart what them old women says?
Camilla'll be never the  worse to look at, because of old women impudence.
Besides, fretting does no good to  nothing.
If you'll only come and stand here, where I do, Miss, you may have a  peep at ever so many dogs, and all the gentlemen, riding helter skelter round  that hill.
It's a pretty sight enough for them as has nothing better to mind.
I  don't know but I might make one among them myself, now and then, if it was not  for the expensiveness of hiring of a horse.'
Here some of the party came galloping towards some of the party; and Mr. Dubster made so  loud an outcry, that two or three of the sportsmen looked up, and one of some of the party,  riding close to the summer-house, perceived the two young ladies, and,  instantly dismounting, fastened his horse to a tree, and contrived to scramble  up into the little unfinished building.
Camilla then saw it was Major Cerwood.
Camilla explained to his the mischievous  frolick of Camilla brother, and accepted his offered services to find the ladder  and the carriage.
Eugenia meanwhile rose and courtsied in answer to his enquiries after Eugenia  health, and then, gravely fixing Eugenia eyes upon the ground, took no further  notice of his.
The object of the Major was not Eugenia; Eugenia taciturnity therefore did not  affect her taciturnity; but pleased to be shut up with Camilla, her taciturnity soon found out that  though to mount had been easy, to descend would be difficult; and, after  various mock efforts, pronounced it would be necessary to wait till some  assistance arrived from below: adding, Sir Hugh Tyrold would soon return, as  Sir Hugh Tyrold had seen Sir Hugh Tyrold in the hunt.
Camilla, whose concern now was all for Sir Hugh Tyrold sister, heard this with  indifference; but Mr. Dubster lost all patience.
'So here,' said Mr. Dubster, 'I may  stay, and let Tom Hicks eat up all my dinner!
for I can't expect Mr. Dubster to fast,  because of this young gentleman's comical tricks.
I've half a mind to give a  jump down Mr. Dubster, and go look for the ladder; only I'm not over light.
Besides,  if one should break one's leg, it's but a hard thing upon a man to be a cripple  in the middle of life.
It's no such great hindrance to a lady, so I don't say  it out of disrespect; because ladies can't do much at the best.'
the Major, finding Mr. Dubster was Mr. Dubster host, thought it necessary to take some  notice of Mr. Dubster, and ask Mr. Dubster if Mr. Dubster never rode out.
'Why no, not much of that, Sir,' Mr. Dubster answered; 'for when a man's not over used  to riding, one's apt to get a bad tumble sometimes.
I believe it's as well let  alone.
I never see as there was much wit in breaking one's neck before one's  time.
Besides, half them gentlemen are no better than sharpers, begging pardon,  for all half them gentlemen look as if half them gentlemen could knock one down.'
'How do you mean sharpers, Sir?'
'Why sharpers, Sir don't pay everyone Sir own, not one in ten of sharpers, Sir.
And sharpers, Sir're as  proud as Lucifer.
If I was to go among sharpers, Sir to-morrow, I'll lay a wager sharpers, Sir'd  take no notice of me: unless I was to ask sharpers, Sir to dinner.
And a man may soon  eat up a man substance, if a man's so over complaisant.'
'Surely, Major,' cried Camilla, 'my brother cannot be much longer before a man  joins us?—remembers us rather.'
'Who else could desert or forget you?'
cried the Major.
'It's a moot point whether a man'll come or no, I see that,' said Mr. Dubster,  quite enraged; 'Mr.
Dubster,   young 'squires never know what to do for Mr. Dubster,   fun.
I must  needs say I think it's pity but what a man'd been brought up to some calling.
'Twould have steadied a man a little, I warrant.
a man don't seem to know much of  the troubles of life.'
A shower of rain now revived a man hopes that the fear of being wet might bring  a man back; not considering how little sportsmen regard wet jackets.
'However,' continued a man, 'it's really a piece of good luck that a man was not  taken with a fancy to leave us upon my island; and then us might all have been  soused by this here rain: and a man could just as well have walked off with my  bridge as with the ladder.'
Here, to a man inexpressible relief, Lionel, from the road, hailed his inexpressible relief, Lionel, from the road; and  Camilla, with emotion the most violent, perceived Edgar was by Edgar side.
Mr. Dubster, however, angry as well as glad, very solemnly said, 'I wonder,  Sir, what you think my workmen has been doing all this time, with nobody to  look after my workmen?
Besides that I promised a pot o'beer to a lad to wheel me away  all that rubbish that I'd cut out of my grotto; and it's a good half day's  work, do it who will; and ten to one if my workmen've stirred a nail, all left to  my workmen so.'
'Pho, pho, man, you've been too happy, I hope, to trouble your mind about  business.
How do do my little girls?
how you have been entertained?'
'This is a better joke to you than to us 'squire; but pray, Sir, begging  pardon, how come you to forget what I told you about the Globe?
I know very  well that the Globe say it's quite alley-mode to make fun, but I can't pretend as  I'm over fond of the custom.'
then desired that, at least, if   would not get the ladder  ,    would tell that other gentleman, that was with  , what   had done with it.
Edgar, having met Lionel, and heard from Lionel how and where Lionel had left Lionel  sisters, had impatiently ridden with Lionel to their relief; but when Lionel saw that  the Major made one in the party, and that Lionel was standing by Camilla, Lionel  felt hurt and amazed, and proceeded no farther.
Camilla believed Camilla careless of his opinion; what Camilla had heard from MissMargland of Lionel professed indifference, gave Camilla now as much resentment, as at  first it had caused Camilla grief.
Camilla thought such a declaration an unprovoked  indignity; Camilla deigned not even to look at Lionel, resolved for ever to avoid Lionel;  yet to prove Camilla, at the same time, unmortified and disengaged, talked  cheerfully with the Major.
Lionel now, producing the ladder, ran up the ladder to help Lionel sisters to descend; and  Edgar, dismounting, could not resist entering the grounds, to offer Edgar, dismounting Lionel  hand as Edgar, dismounting came down.
Eugenia was first assisted; for Camilla talked on with the Major, as if not  hearing Camilla was called: and Mr. Dubster, his complaisance wholly worn out, next  followed, bowing low to everyone separately, and begging pardon, but saying his  could really afford to waste no more time, without going to give a little look  after his workmen, to see if they were alive or dead.
At this time the horse of the Major, by some accident, breaking loose, his  master was forced to run down, and Lionel scampered after to assist his  master.
Camilla remained alone; Edgar, slowly mounting the ladder, gravely offered his  master  services; but, hastily leaning out of the window, Camilla pretended to be too much  occupied in watching the motions of the Major and his  master horse, to hear or attend  to any thing else.
A sigh now tore the heart of Edgar, from doubt if this were preference to the  Major, or the first dawn of incipient coquetry; but his  master called not upon Camilla  again; his  master stood quietly behind, till his horse was seized, and the Major  re-ascended the ladder.
They then stood at each side of it, with offers of  assistance.
This appeared to Camilla a fortunate moment for making a spirited display of  Camilla indifference: Camilla gave Camilla hand to the Major, and, slightly courtesying to  Edgar as Camilla passed, was conducted to the carriage of Camilla uncle.
Lionel again was the only one who spoke in the short route to Etherington,  whence Eugenia, without alighting, returned to Cleves.
