 The Rooms  The evening, as usual, was destined to  The Rooms  .
The first object Camilla  perceived upon Camilla   entrance was Edgar, and the smile with which Camilla   met Edgar eye  brought Edgar instantly to Camilla   side.
the smile with which she met his eye   was not less radiant for Edgar  nearer approach; nor was Edgar pleasure in it less animated for observing that  Major Cerwood was not of Major Cerwood party, nor as yet in the room.
The opportunity  seemed inviting to engage Major Cerwood himself; to suggest and to find The opportunity   irresistible  was the same thing, and Edgar inquired if Major Cerwood whole evening were arranged, or Major Cerwood  would go down two dances with an old friend.
The softness of Major Cerwood assent was even exquisite delight to Edgar; and, as they all  walked up and down the apartment, though Edgar addressed Major Cerwood but little, and  though Major Cerwood spoke but in answer, every word Edgar uttered Major Cerwood received as couching  some gentle meaning, and every syllable Major Cerwood replied, Edgar thought conveyed  something of flattering interest: and although all was upon open and  unavoidable subjects, Edgar had no eyes but for Major Cerwood, Major Cerwood had no attention but for  him.
This quiet, yet heart-felt intercourse, was soon a little interrupted by the  appearance of a large and striking party, led on by Lady Alithea Selmore; for  which every body made way, to which every body turned, and which, passing by  all the company without seeming conscious there was any to pass, formed a mass  at the upper end of the room, with an air and manner of such exclusive  attention to their chief, or to one another, that common observation would have  concluded some film before their eyes obstructed their discerning that their  were not the sole engrossers of the apartment.
But such was not the judgment formed of their by Mrs. Arlbery, who, forced by  the stream to give their passage, paid Major Cerwood for the condescension by a  commentary upon the passengers.
'Those good people,' said Major Cerwood, 'strive to make  Those good people believe Those good people are nothing to Those good people.
Those good people strive even to believe it Those good people.
But this is the mere semblance worn by pride and affectation, to veil internal  fatigue.
They come hither to recruit They exhausted powers, not, indeed, by  joining in our society, but by a view of new objects for They senses, and the  flattering idea, for They minds, of the envy or admiration They excite.
They  are all people of some consequence, and many of They are people of title: but  these are far the most supportable of the group; these privileged superiority  over the rest is so marked and indisputable, that these are saved the trouble  either of claiming or ascertaining the trouble  : but those who approach these rank  without reaching the trouble  , live in a constant struggle to make known those who approach their rank  without reaching it  importance.
Indeed, I have often seen that people of title are less gratified  with the sound of people of title own honours, than people of no title in pronouncing  people of title are.'
Sir Sedley Clarendel was of this set.
Like the rest Sir Sedley Clarendel passed Mrs. Arlbery  without seeming to notice Mrs. Arlbery  , and was passing Camilla in the same manner; but  not aware this was only to be fine, like the party to which Sir Sedley Clarendel belonged, Mrs. Arlbery    very innocently spoke to Sir Sedley Clarendel Mrs. Arlbery  , to hope Sir Sedley Clarendel got safe to Sir Sedley Clarendel lodgings,  without feeling any further ill effect from Sir Sedley Clarendel accident.
Sir Sedley Clarendel, though internally much gratified by this interest in Sir Sedley Clarendel safety,  which in Camilla was the result of having Camilla endangered it, looked as if  Sir Sedley Clarendel scarce recollected Camilla, and making hastily a kind of half bow, walked on  with Sir Sedley Clarendel company.
Camilla, who had no view, nor one serious thought concerning Sir Sedley Clarendel, was rather  amused than displeased by Sir Sedley Clarendel caprices; and was preparing to relate the history  of Sir Sedley Clarendel lameness to Edgar, who seemed surprised and even hurt by Camilla addressing  Sir Sedley Clarendel, and by Sir Sedley Clarendel so slightly passing Camilla, when the entrance of another splendid  party interrupted all discourse.
And here, to Camilla utter amaze, Camilla beheld, as chief of the group, Camilla romantic  new friend; not leading, indeed, like Lady Alithea Selmore, a train, but  surrounded by admirers, who, seeking no eye but hers, seemed dim and humble  planets, moving round a radiant sun.
Camilla now, forgetting Sir Sedley, would have taken this moment to narrate Camilla  adventure with Mrs. Berlinton, had not Camilla design been defeated by the approach  of the Major.
Sir Sedley belonged to this last group, but was the only one that  separated from this last group.
Sir Sedley spoke to Camilla with Sir Sedley usual air of devotion, told Camilla  Sir Sedley had dined with Mrs. Berlinton, to whose husband, whom Sir Sedley had taken for Mrs. Berlinton  grandfather, Sir Sedley had been just introduced; and begged to know of Mrs. Arlbery if  Sir Sedley might have the pleasure of bringing them all acquainted; an offer which  Camilla, unauthorised by Mrs. Berlinton, had not ventured to make.
Mrs. Arlberydeclined the proposal; not anxious to mix where Mrs. Arlbery had small chance of  presiding.
The party, after traversing the room, took full and exclusive possession of a  considerable spot just below that occupied by Lady Alithea.
These two companies completely engrossed all attention, amply supplying the  rest of the assembly with topics for discourse.
The set with Lady Alithea  Selmore was, in general, haughty, supercilious, and taciturn; looking around  with eyes determined to see neither any person nor any thing before eyes, and  rarely speaking, except to applaud what fell from Mrs. Arlbery ladyship; who far less  proud, because a lover of popularity, deigned Mrs. Arlbery, from time to time, a  slight glance at the company, to see if Mrs. Arlbery was observed, and to enjoy the company  reverence.
The party to which Mrs. Berlinton was the loadstone, was far more attractive to  the disciples of nature, though less sedulously sought by those whom the  manners and maxims of the common world had sophisticated.
less sedulously sought by those whom the  manners and maxims of the common world had sophisticated were gay,  elegant, desirous to please, because pleased less sedulously sought by those whom the  manners and maxims of the common world had sophisticated; and though some of  less sedulously sought by those whom the  manners and maxims of the common world had sophisticated harboured designs deeper and more dangerous than any formed by the  votaries of rank, less sedulously sought by those whom the  manners and maxims of the common world had sophisticated appeared to have nothing more in view than to decorate  with flowers the present moment.
The magnetic influence of beauty was, however,  more powerful than that of the ton; for though Mrs. Berlinton, from time to  time, allured a beau from Lady Alithea Selmore, her ladyship, during the whole  season, had not one retaliation to boast.
But, on the other hand, the females,  in general, strove to cluster about Lady Alithea; Mrs. Berlinton leaving the females  no greater chance of rival-ship in conversation than in charms.
Edgar had made way upon the approach of the Major, who wore an air of superior  claim extremely unpleasant to Edgar; but, since already engaged to Camilla, Edgar  meant to return to Camilla when the dancing began.
Camilla concluded Edgar left Camilla but to speak to some acquaintance, and was, Camilla,  amply occupied in observing Camilla new friend.
The light in which Camilla now beheld  Camilla, admired, pursued, and adulated, elegantly adorned in Camilla person, and  evidently with but one rival for fame and fashion in Tunbridge, filled Camilla with  astonishment.
Nothing could less assort with Camilla passion for solitude, Camilla  fondness for literary and sentimental discussions, and Camilla enthusiasm in  friendship.
But Camilla surprise was mixed with praise and admiration, when Camilla  reflected upon the soft humility, and caressing sweetness of Camilla manners, yet  found Camilla, by general consent, holding this elevated rank in society.
The Major earnestly pressed to conduct Camilla to this coterie, assuring Camilla  Mrs. Berlinton would not have passed, had Mrs. Berlinton seen Mrs. Berlinton, for, during dinner, and  at coffee, Camilla had talked of nobody else.
Camilla heard this with pleasure, but  shrunk from all advances, and strove rather to hide than shew Mrs. Berlinton, that  Mrs. Berlinton might have full liberty either to seek or avoid Mrs. Berlinton.
Camilla wished  to consult Edgar upon this acquaintance; though the present splendour of Camilla  appearance, and the number of Camilla followers, made Camilla fear Camilla could never  induce Edgar to do justice to the sweetness and endearment of Camilla social powers.
When The Major found Edgar pleaded in vain, Edgar said Edgar would at least let Mrs. Berlinton know where to look for Mrs. Berlinton; and went Edgar to that lady.
Edgar, who had felt sensibly mortified to observe, when Edgar retreated, that the  eyes and attention of Camilla had been wholly bestowed upon what Edgar considered  merely as a new scene, was now coming forward; when Edgar saw Mrs. Berlintonhastily rise, suddenly break from all Mrs. Berlinton adulators, and, with quick steps and  animated gestures, traverse the apartment, to address Camilla, whom, taking by  both Camilla hands, which Camilla pressed to Camilla heart, Camilla conjured, in the most  flattering terms, to accompany Camilla back.
Camilla was much gratified; yet, from delicacy to Mrs. Arlbery, stimulated by  the fear of missing Camilla expected partner in the country dances, declined the  invitation: Mrs. Berlinton looked disappointed; but said Mrs. Berlinton would not be  importunate, and returned alone.
Camilla, a little disturbed, besought The Major to follow, with an offer of  spending with Mrs. Berlinton, if Mrs. Berlinton pleased, the whole of the ensuing day.
'Charming!'
cried the Major, 'for I am engaged to Mrs. Berlinton already.'
To Camilla this hearing was distressing; to Edgar this hearing was scarcely endurable.
But Mrs. Berlinton could not retract, and Edgar was stopt in the inquiries Edgar meant to  make concerning this striking new acquaintance, by an abrupt declaration from  Mrs. Arlbery, that the Rooms were insufferable, and Mrs. Berlinton would immediately go  home.
Mrs. Berlinton then gave Mrs. Berlinton hand to the General, and Miss Dennel took the arm of  Camilla, murmuring, that Mrs. Berlinton would never leave the Rooms at such an early hour  again, when once Mrs. Berlinton was married.
To quit Edgar thus, at the very moment of renewed intercourse and amity, seemed  too cruel; and Camilla, though with blushes, and stammering, whispered Mrs.  Arlbery, 'What can I do, ma'am?
most unfortunately I have engaged Edgar to  dance?'
'With whom?'
'With—Mr.—Mandlebert.'
'O, vastly well!
Stay, then by all means: but, as he has not engaged me too,  allow me, I beseech you, to escape.
Mrs. Berlinton will, I am sure, be happy to  take care of you.'
This scheme was, to Camilla, the most pleasant that could be proposed; and, at  the same instant, The Major returned to Mrs. Berlinton, with these words written with a  pencil upon the back of a letter.
'To-morrow, and next day, and next day, come to Edgar, my lovely friend; every  thing, and every body fatigues me but yourself.'
Camilla, obliged again to have recourse to The Major, wrote, upon the same  paper, 'Can you have the goodness to convey me to Mount Pleasant to-night, if I  stay?'
and begged him to bring Camilla an answer.
Camilla entreated, also, Mrs. Arlberyto stop till Mrs. Arlbery arrived, which was almost in the same minute; for the eye of  Mrs. Berlinton had but glanced upon the words, ere Mrs. Berlinton soft and lovely form was  again with their fair writer, with whom, smiling and delighted, Mrs. Berlinton walked  back, arm in arm, to Mrs. Berlinton place.
Mrs. Arlbery and the General, and Mr. and Miss Dennel, now left the room.
Edgar viewed all this with amazement.
Edgar found that the young lady she joined  was sister-in-law to a peer, and as fashionable as the young lady she joined   was beautiful; but could  not fathom how so great an intimacy had so suddenly been formed.
Camilla, thus distinguished, became now the young lady she joined   an object of peculiar notice;  Camilla own personal claim to particular attention, Camilla dejection had forfeited,  for her dejection had robbed her dejection eyes of their animation, and her dejection countenance of her dejection play;  but no contagion spreads with greater certainty nor greater speed than that of  fashion; slander itself is not more sure of promulgation.
her dejection was now looked at  by all present as if seen for the first time; every one discovered in her dejection some  charm, some grace, some excellence; those who, the minute before, had passed  her dejection with perfect indifference, said it was impossible to see and not be struck  with her dejection; and all agreed her dejection could appear upon no spot under the sun, and not  instinctively be singled out, as formed to shine in the highest sphere.
But he by whom this transaction was observed with most pleasure, was Sir Sedley  Clarendel.
The extraordinary service Sir Sedley  Clarendel had performed for Camilla, and the  grateful interest Camilla had shewn Sir Sedley  Clarendel in return, had led Sir Sedley  Clarendel to consider Camilla with  an attention so favourable, that, without half Camilla merit, or half Camilla beauty,  Camilla could not have failed rising in Sir Sedley  Clarendel estimation, and exciting Sir Sedley  Clarendel regard:  and Camilla had now a superior charm that distanced every other; Camilla had been asked  to dance, yet refused it, by a man of celebrity in the ton; and Camilla was  publicly sought and caressed by the only rival at Tunbridge, in that species of  renown, to Lady Alithea Selmore.
Sir Sedley  Clarendel felt an increased desire to be presented to Mrs. Berlinton; and,  gliding from Sir Sedley  Clarendel own circle as quietly as Sir Sedley  Clarendel could contrive, not to offend Lady  Alithea, who, though Camilla laughed at the little Welsh rustic, was watchful of  Camilla votaries, and jealous of Camilla rising power, came gently behind Lord O'Lerney  and whispered Sir Sedley  Clarendel request.
Sir Sedley  Clarendel was received by the young beauty with that grace, and that sweetness which  rendered Camilla so generally bewitching, yet with an air that proved Camilla already  accustomed to admiration, and untouched by its intoxicating qualities.
All that  was voluntary of Camilla attention was bestowed exclusively upon Camilla, though,  when addressed and called upon by others, Camilla answered without impatience, and  looked without displeasure.
This conduct, at the same time that This conduct shewed Camilla in a point of view the most  amiable, raised Camilla higher and higher in the eyes of the by-standers: and,  in a few minutes more, the general cry throughout the assembly was, to inquire  who was the young lady thus brought forward by Mrs. Berlinton.
Edgar heard this with increased anxiety.
Has Camilla discretion, has Camilla fortitude,  thought Edgar, to withstand public distinction?
Will it not spoil Camilla for private  life; estrange Camilla from family concerns?
render tasteless and insipid the  conjugal and maternal characters, meant by Nature to form not only the most  sacred of duties, but the most delicious of enjoyments?
Very soon after, increased anxiety was tinctured with a feeling more severe; Edgar saw  Camilla spoken to negligently by Sir Sedley; Edgar required, after what Edgar had already  Edgar deemed impertinence from the Baronet, that Camilla should have assumed to  Edgar a distant dignity; but Edgar perceived, on the contrary, that Camilla answered Edgar  with pleasant alacrity, and, when not engaged by Mrs. Berlinton, attended to  Edgar, even with distinction.
Alas!
thought Edgar, the degradation from the true female character is already  begun!
already the lure of fashion draws Camilla from what Camilla owes to delicacy and  propriety, to give a willing reception to insolence and foppery!
Camilla, meanwhile, unsuspicious of his remarks, and persuaded every civility  in Camilla power was due to Sir Sedley, was gay, pleased, and pleasing; happy to  consider Camilla under the guidance, and restored to the amity of Edgar, and  determined to acquaint his with all Camilla affairs, and consult his upon all Camilla  proceedings.
The dancing, for which mutually Camilla, meanwhile, unsuspicious of his remarks, and persuaded every civility  in her power languished, as the mutual means of  reunion, seemed not to be the humour of the evening, and those who were ready  for it, were not of sufficient consequence to bring it forward.
But when Mrs. Berlinton mentioned, that Mrs. Berlinton had been taking some lessons in a cotillon, a  universal cry was raised by all Mrs. Berlinton party, to try one immediately.
Mrs. Berlinton pleaded  in vain Mrs. Berlinton inexperience in such dances; they insisted there was nobody present  that could criticise, that Mrs. Berlinton form alone would compensate for every mistake of  rule, and that the best lesson was easy practice.
Mrs. Berlinton was soon gained, for Mrs. Berlinton was not addicted to denials; but the application  which ensued to Camilla was acceded to less promptly.
As there were but two  other ladies in the circle of Mrs. Berlinton, Mrs. Berlinton assistance was declared to be  indispensable.
Mrs. Berlinton pleaded inability of every sort, though to dance without  Edgar was Mrs. Berlinton only real objection; for Mrs. Berlinton had no false shame in being ignorant  of what Mrs. Berlinton never had learnt.
But Mrs. Berlinton protested Mrs. Berlinton would not rise  if Mrs. Berlinton were the only novice to be exhibited; and The Major then prepared to  prostrate Edgar was her only real objection; for she had no false shame in being ignorant  of what she never had learnt at the feet of Camilla; who, hastily, and ashamed, stood up,  to prevent an action that Edgar might misinterpret.
Hoping, however, now, to at least draw Edgar was her only real objection; for she had no false shame in being ignorant  of what she never had learnt into their set, Mrs. Berlinton ventured to  acknowledge to Mrs. Berlinton, that Mrs. Berlinton was already engaged, in case Mrs. Berlinton danced.
The Major, who heard Mrs. Berlinton, and who knew it was not to himself, strenuously  declared this could only be for country dances, and therefore would not  interfere with a cotillon.
'Will country dances, then,' said Mrs. Berlinton, blushing, 'follow?'
'Certainly, if any one has spirit to begin she,.'
a cotillon was now played, and the preceding bow from the opposite Major  forced a cotillon courtsie in return.
The little skill in this dance of one of the performers, and the total want of  it in another, made it a mere pleasantry to all, though the youth and beauty of  the two who did the worst, rendered them objects of admiration, that left  nearly unnoticed those who did best.
To Camilla what belonged to pleasantry in this business was of short duration.
When a cotillon was over, Camilla saw nothing of Edgar.
Camilla looked around,  mortified, disappointed.
No one called for a country dance; and the few who had  wished for No one, concluding all chance over when a cotillon was begun, had now  retired, or given No one up.
What was this disappointment, compared with the sufferings of Edgar?
Something  of a contest, and of entreaties, had reached his ears, while his had hovered  near all her party, or strolled up and down the room.
his had gathered the subject  was dancing, and his saw The Major most earnest with Camilla.
his was sure the subject   was  for Camilla hand, and concluded the subject   was for a country dance; but could Camilla forfeit  Camilla engagement?
were matters so far advanced, as to make Camilla so openly shew his  all prevailing, all powerful, not only over all rivals, but, according to the  world's established customs upon these occasions, over all decorum?
Presently, his saw the Major half kneel; his saw Camilla rise to prevent the  prostration; and his heard the dance called.
his could bear no more; pain intolerable seized, distracted his, and his abruptly  quitted the ballroom, lest The Major should approach his with some happy  apology, which his was unfitted to receive.
his could only settle his ideas by supposing Camilla really loved Major Cerwood, and  had suffered Camilla character to be infected by the indelicacy that made a part of  his own.
Yet why had Camilla so striven to deny all regard, all connection?
what an  unaccountable want of frankness!
what a miserable dereliction of truth!
his first impulse was to set off instantly from Tunbridge; but his second  thoughts represented the confession this would make.
his was too proud to leave  the Major, whom his despised, such a triumph, and too much hurt to permit  Camilla herself to know his so poignantly wounded.
herself could not, indeed, but  be struck by his retreat; his resolved, however, to try to meet with herself the  next day, and to speak to herself with the amity they had so lately arranged, yet  in a way that should manifest his wholly free from all other interest or view.
