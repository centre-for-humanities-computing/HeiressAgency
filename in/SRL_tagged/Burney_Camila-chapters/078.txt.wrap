 Resolutions  The sound of the dinner-bell, which rang in the ears of Edgar before he reached  his intended retreat, would have been unnoticed, if not seconded by a message  from Sir Hugh, who had seen him from his window.  Compelled to obey, though in a state of suspense almost intolerable, he put up  the important little packet, and repaired to the dining parlour; where, though  none were equally disturbed with himself, no one was at ease. Young Lynmere,  under an appearance of mingled assurance and apathy, the effect of acquired  conceit, playing upon natural insipidity, was secretly tormented with the  rueful necessity of sacrificing either a noble fortune, or his own fine person;  Sir Hugh felt a strange disappointment from the whole behaviour of his nephew,  though it was what he would not acknowledge, and could not define; Mr. Tyrold  saw with much uneasiness the glaringly apparent unsuitableness of the intended  alliance; Eugenia had never yet thought herself so plain and insignificant, and  felt as if, even since the morning, the small-pox had renewed its ravages, and  she had sunk into being shorter; Indiana and Miss Margland were both acutely  incensed with Mandlebert; Dr. Orkborne saw but small reason to expect gratitude  for his labours from the supercilious negligence of the boasted young student;  Lavinia was disturbed for both her sisters; and Camilla felt that all she  valued in life depended upon the next critical hour or two.  In this state of general discomfort, Sir Hugh, who could never be silent, alone  talked. Having long prepared himself to look upon this meeting as a day of  happiness, he strove to believe, for a while, the whole family were peculiarly  enjoying themselves; but, upon a dead silence, which ensued upon his taking a  copious draught of Madeira and water, 'Why, my dear nephew,' he cried, putting  down his goblet, 'you don't tell us any thing? which I've no doubt but you know  why yourself. However, as we're all met o' purpose to see you, I can't say I  should be sorry to hear the sound of your voice, provided it won't be  disagreeable.'  'We are not much—conversant, sir, in each other's connexions, I believe,'  answered Lynmere, without ceasing a moment to eat, and to help himself, and  ordering a fresh plate at every second mouthful; 'I have seen nothing, yet, of  your folks hereabouts; and, I fancy, sir, you don't know a great deal of the  people I have been used to.'  Sir Hugh, having good humouredly acknowledged this to be truth, was at a loss  what further to purpose; and, imagining the taciturnity of the rest of the  party to proceed from an awe of the knowledge and abilities of his nephew, soon  became himself so infected with fear and reverence, that, though he could not  be silent, he spoke only to those who were next him, and in a whisper.  When the dessert was served, something like a general relief was effected by  the unexpected entrance of Dr. Marchmont. Alarmed by the ungoverned, and, in  him, unprecedented, emotions of Edgar, he had been to Beech Park; and, finding  he had not returned there, had ridden on, in the most uneasy uncertainty, to  inquire for him at Cleves.  Happy to see him safe, though almost smiling to see with whom, he was beginning  some excuse for his intrusion, when the baronet saved his proceeding, by  calling out, 'Well, this is as good a piece of good luck as any we've met with  yet! Here's Dr. Marchmont come to wish us joy; and as he's as good a scholar as  yourself, nephew, for any thing I know to the contrary, why you need not be so  afraid of speaking, for the sake of our not understanding you; which here's  five of us can do now, as well as yourself.'  Lynmere, readily concluding Mr. Tyrold and Edgar, with the two Doctors, made  four, glanced round the table to see who might be the fifth; when, supposing it  Miss Margland, he withdrew his eyes with a look of derision, and, turning to  the butler, asked what wines he might call for.  Sir Hugh then proposed that they should all pair off; the ignorant ones going  one way, and the learned ones staying another.  It would be difficult to say which looked most averse to this proposition,  Eugenia, or the young traveller; who hastily said, 'I always ride after dinner,  sir. Is your groom at hand? Can he shew me your horses?'  'My nephew little suspects,' cried Sir Hugh, winking, 'Eugenia belongs to the  scholars! Ten to one but he thinks he's got Homer and Horace to himself! But  here, my dear boy, as you're so fond of the classics'—  Clermont, nimbly rising, and knocking down a decanter of water in his haste,  but not turning back to look at it, nor staying to offer any apology, affected  not to hear his uncle, and flung hastily out of the room, calling upon Indiana  to follow him.  'In the name of all the Diavoli,' cried he, pulling her into the park with him,  'what does all this mean? Is the old gentleman non compos? what's all this  stuff he descants upon so freely, of scholars, and classics, and Homer, and  Horace?'  'O you must ask Eugenia, not me!' answered Indiana, scornfully.  'Why, what does Eugenia know of the matter?'  'Know? why every thing. She's a great scholar, and has been brought up by Dr.  Orkborne; and she talks Greek and Latin.'  'Does she so? then, by the Lord! she's no wife of mine! I'd as soon marry the  old Doctor himself! and I'm sure he'd make me as pretty a wife. Greek and  Latin! why I'd as soon tie myself to a rod. Pretty sort of dinners she'll give!'  'O dear, yes, brother; she don't care what she eats; she cares for nothing but  books, and such kind of things.'  'Books! ha! ha! Books, and Latin and Greek! upon my faith, a pretty wife the  old gentleman has been so good as to find me! why he must be a downright  driveller!'  'Ah, brother, if we had all that fortune, what a different figure we should cut  with it!'  'Why, yes, I rather flatter myself we should. No great need of five thousand a  year to pore over books! Ha! ha! faith, this is a good hum enough! So he thinks  to take me in, does he?'  'Why, you know, she is so rich, brother....'  'Rich? well, and what am I? do you see such a figure as this,' (suddenly  skipping before her,) 'every day? Am I reduced to my last legs, think you? Do  you suppose I can't meet with some kind old dowager any time these twenty  years?'  'La, brother, won't you have her then?'  'No, faith, won't I! It's not come to that, neither. This learning is worse  than her ugliness; 'twould make me look like a dunce in my own house.'  He then protested he had rather lose forty estates, than so be sacrificed, and  vowed, without venturing a direct refusal, he would soon sicken the old  gentleman of his scheme.  Eugenia, in retreating to her room, was again accompanied by her father and her  uncle, whom she conjured now, to name her to Clermont no more.  'I can't say I admire these puttings off, my dear,' said the baronet, 'in this  our mortal state, which is always liable to end in our dying. Not that I  pretend to tell you I think him over much alert; but there's no knowing but  what he may have some meaning in it that we can't understand; a person having  studied all his life, has a right to a little particularity.'  Mr. Tyrold himself now seriously interfered, and desired that, henceforth,  Clermont might be treated as if his visit to Cleves was merely to congratulate  his uncle upon his recovery; and that all schemes, preparations, and allusions,  might be put aside, unless the youth himself, and with a good grace, brought  them forward; meanwhile, he and Lavinia would return without delay to  Etherington, to obviate all appearance of waiting the decision of any plan.  Sir Hugh was much discomfited by the exaction of such forbearance, yet could  the less oppose it, from his own internal discontent with his nephew, which he  inadvertently betrayed, by murmuring, in his way to his chamber, 'There's no  denying but what they've got some odd-fangled new ways of their own, in those  foreign parts; meeting a set of old relations for the first time, and saying  nothing to them, but asking for the newspapers! Lord help us! caring about the  wide world, so, when we know nothing of it, instead of one's own uncles and  nephews, and kinspeople!'  During this time, Edgar, almost agonised by suspence and doubt, had escaped to  the summer-house, whither he was followed by Dr. Marchmont, greatly to the  wonder, almost with the contempt of Dr. Orkborne; whom he quitted, in anxiety  for his young friend, just as he had intimated a design to consult him upon a  difficult passage in an ancient author, which had a place in his work, that was  now nearly ready for the press.  'I know well, Doctor,' said Edgar, 'that to find me here, after all that has  passed, will make you conclude me the weakest of men ... but I cannot now  explain how it has been brought about ... these letters must first tell me if  Camilla and I meet more than once again.'  He then hastily ran over the letters; but by no means hastily could he digest,  nor even comprehend their contents. He thought them florid, affected, and  presuming; yet vague, studied, with little appearance of sincerity, and less of  explicit decision. What related to Lionel, and to aiding him in the disposal of  his wealth, seemed least intelligible, yet most like serious meaning; but when  he found that the interview at the Grove was by positive appointment, and  granted to a request made with a forwardness and assurance so wide from all  delicacy and propriety, the blood mounted high into his cheeks, and,  precipitately putting up the packet, he exclaimed: 'Here, then, it ends! the  last little ray of hesitation is extinct ... extinct to be kindled never more!'  The sound of these last words caused him an emotion of sorrow he was unable to  resist, though unwilling to betray, and he hurried out of the summer-house to  the wood, where he strove to compose his mind to the last leave-taking upon  which he was now determined; but so dreadful was the resolution which exacted  from his own mouth the resignation of all that, till now, had been dearest to  his views and hopes, that the afternoon was far advanced, before he could  assume sufficient courage to direct his steps to the spot where the sacrifice  was to be made.  Accusing himself, then, of weakness unpardonable, he returned to the  summer-house, to apologise to Dr. Marchmont for his abrupt retreat; but the  Doctor had already re-entered the mansion. Thither, therefore, he proceeded,  purposing to seek Camilla, to return her the letters of Sir Sedley, and to  desire her commands in what manner to conduct himself with her father and her  uncle, in acknowledging his fears that the projected union would fail of  affording, to either party, the happiness which, at first, it seemed to promise.  The carriage of Sir Hugh was in waiting at the door, and Mr. Tyrold and Lavinia  were in the hall. Edgar, in no condition for such an encounter, would have  avoided them; but Mr. Tyrold, little suspecting his desire, rejoiced at the  meeting, saying he had had the house searched for him in vain, that he might  shake hands with him before his return to Etherington.  Then, taking him apart, 'My dear Edgar,' he cried, 'I have long loved you as  tenderly, and I may now confide in you as completely, as if you were my son. I  go hence in some inquietude; I fear my brother has been too hasty in making  known his views with regard to Clermont; who does not seem equal to  appreciating the worth of Eugenia, though it is evident he has not been slack  in noticing her misfortunes. I entreat you, during my absence, to examine him  as if you were already the brother of that dear child, who merits, you well  know, the best and tenderest of husbands.'  He then followed Lavinia into the carriage, prevented by his own occupied mind  from observing the fallen countenance of Edgar, who, more wretched than ever,  bemoaned now the kindness of which he had hitherto been proud, and lamented the  paternal trust which he would have purchased the day before almost with life.  Camilla, during this period, had gone through conflicts no less severe.  Jacob, who had bought a horse, for which he had cheerfully advanced 20 l. had  informed her of the gate adventure of Edgar, and told her that, but for his  stopping him, he was riding like mad from Cleves, and only sending them all a  message that he could not come back.  Grieved, surprised, and offended, she instantly determined she would not risk  such another mark of his cold superiority, but restore to him his liberty, and  leave him master of himself. 'If the severity of his judgment,' cried she, 'is  so much more potent than the warmth of his affection, it shall not be his  delicacy, nor his compassion, that shall make me his. I will neither be the  wife of his repentance nor of his pity. I must be convinced of his unaltered  love, his esteem, his trust ... or I shall descend to humiliation, not rise to  happiness, in becoming his. Softness here would be meanness; submission  degrading ... if he hesitates ... let him go!'  She then, without weighing, or even seeing one objection, precipitately  resolved to beg permission of her friends, to accept an invitation she had  received, without as yet answering, to meet Mrs. Berlinton at Southampton,  where that lady was going to pass some weeks. She could there, she thought,  give the rejection which here its inviolable circumstances made her, for  Lionel's sake, afraid to risk; or she could there, if a full explanation should  appease him, find opportunity to make it with equal safety; his dislike to that  acquaintance rather urged than impeded her plan, for her wounded spirit panted  to prove its independence and dignity.  Eugenia approved this elevation of sentiment, and doubted not it would shew her  again in her true light to Edgar, and bring him, with added esteem, to her feet.  Camilla wept with joy at the idea: 'Ah!' she cried, 'if such should be my happy  fate; if, after hearing all my imprudence, my precipitance, and want of  judgment, he should voluntarily, when wholly set free, return to me ... I will  confess to him every feeling ... and every failing of my heart! I will open to  him my whole soul, and cast myself ever after upon his generosity and his  goodness.... O, my Eugenia! almost on my knees could I receive ... a second  time ... the vows of Edgar Mandlebert!'
