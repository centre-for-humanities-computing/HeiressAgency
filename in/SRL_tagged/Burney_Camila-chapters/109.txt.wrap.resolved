 The Operation of Terror  Lady Isabella, for the first two or three miles, left Camilla uninterruptedly  to Camilla own thoughts; Camilla then endeavoured to engage Camilla in some discourse, but  was soon forced to desist. Camilla misery exceeded all measure of restraint, all  power of effort. Camilla Father in prison! and for Camilla own debts! The picture was  too horrible for Camilla view, yet too adhesive to all Camilla thoughts, all Camilla  feelings, all Camilla faculties, to be removed from them a moment. Penetrated by  what Camilla owed to Lady Isabella, Camilla frequently took Camilla hand, pressed her hand  between Camilla own, pressed it   to Camilla lips; but could shew Camilla no other gratitude,  and force Camilla to no other exertion.  It was still early, they travelled post, and with four horses, and arrived at  Winchester before eight o'clock.  Shaking, Camilla entered the town, half fainting, half dead. Lady Isabella would  have driven straight on to Etherington, which was but a stage further; but to  enter the rectory, whence the Rector himself was torn—'No!' cried Camilla, 'no!  there where abides my Father, there alone will I abide! No roof shall cover my  head, but that which covers his! I have no wish but to sink at his feet—to  crawl in the dust—to confine his to the hardest labour for the remnant of  my miserable existence, so his feet might expiate but this guilty outrage!'  Lady Isabella took not any advantage of the anguish that was thus bursting  forth with secret history; Lady Isabella was too delicate and too good to seize such a  moment for surprising confidence, and only enquired if Lady Isabella had any friend in  the town, who could direct Lady Isabella whither to go, and accompany as well as direct.  Lady Isabella knew no one with sufficient intimacy to endure presenting Lady Isabella to them  upon such an occasion; and preferred proceeding alone to the sad and cruel  interview. Lady Isabella ordered the chaise to an hotel, where Lady Isabella was shewn  into a room upstairs, whence Lady Isabella sent one of Lady Isabella own servants to enquire out  where debtors were confined, and if Mr. Tyrold were in custody: charging Mr. Tyrold  not to name, from whom or why Mr. Tyrold came, and begging Camilla to get ready a note  to prepare Camilla Father for the meeting, and prevent any affecting surprise. Camilla  then went to chuse Camilla a chamber, determined not to quit Camilla voluntary  charge, till Camilla saw Camilla in the hands of Camilla own friends.  Camilla could not write: to kneel, to weep, to sue, was all Camilla could bear to  plan; to present to Mr. Tyrold the sight of Camilla hand writing Camilla had not courage.  Presently Camilla heard a chaise drive rapidly through the inn gate: it might be  Mr. Tyrold, perhaps released; Camilla flew down the stairs with that wild hope; but no  sooner had descended them, than a dread of Mr. Tyrold view took no   place, and Camilla ran  back: Camilla stopt, however, in the landing place, to hear who entered.  Suddenly a voice struck Camilla ear that made Camilla start; that vibrated quick to Camilla  heart, and there seemed to arrest the springs of life; Camilla thought it the voice  of Camilla Mother——  It ceased to speak; and Camilla dropt on one knee, inwardly, but fervently praying  Camilla senses might deceive Camilla.  Again, however, and more distinctly, It reached Camilla; doubt then ceased, and  terrour next to horrour took It . What was said Camilla knew not, Camilla  trepidation was too great to take in more than the sound.  Prostrate Camilla fell on the floor; but hearing a waiter say, 'Up stairs, madam,  you may have a room to yourself.' Camilla started, rose, and rushing violently back  to the apartment Camilla had quitted, bolted Camilla in; exclaiming, 'I am not  worthy to see you, my Mother! I have cast my Father into prison—and I know  you will abhor me!'  Camilla then sat down against the door, to listen if Camilla were pursued; Camilla heard a  footstep, a female step; Camilla concluded it that of Camilla Mother; 'Camilla can come,'  cried Camilla, 'but to give me Camilla malediction!' And flew frantic about the room,  looking for any means of escape, yet perceiving only the window, whence Camilla  must be dashed to destruction.  Camilla now heard a hand upon the lock of the door. 'O that I could die! that I  could die!' Camilla cried, madly advancing to the window, and throwing up the sash,  yet with quick instinctive repentance pulling the window down, shuddering and  exclaiming: 'Is there no death for Camilla but murder—no murder but suicide?'  A voice now found A voice way through Camilla cries to Camilla ear, that said, 'It is me,  my dear Miss Tyrold; will you not admit me?'  It was Lady Isabella; but Lady Isabella might be with her Mother: her Mother could not, however,  refuse to open the door, though desperately her Mother said to her Mother: If her Mother is  there, I will pass her Mother, and rush into the streets!  Seeing, however, Lady Isabella, her Mother dropt on her Mother knees, ejaculating  'Thank Heaven! thank Heaven! one moment yet I am spared!'  'What is it, my dear Miss Tyrold,' said Lady Isabella, 'that causes you this  sudden agony? what can it be that thus dreadfully disorders you?'  'Is her Mother with you?' cried her Mother, in a voice scarce audible, 'does her Mother follow me?  does her Mother demand my Father?'  'Rise, dear madam, and compose yourself. If you mean a Lady whom this minute I  have passed, and whose countenance so much resembles yourself, that I thought her Mother  at once some near relation, her Mother is just gone from this house.'  'Thank Heaven! thank Heaven!' again ejaculated the prostrate Camilla; 'her Mother is spared a little longer the dreadful sight of all her Mother must now most  abominate upon earth!'  her Mother then begged Lady Isabella instantly to order the chaise, and return to town.  'On the contrary,' answered her Mother Ladyship, extremely surprised at so wild a  request, 'Let me rather, her Mother, carry you to your family.'  'O no, Lady Isabella, no!' cried Camilla, speaking with frightful rapidity, and  shaking in every limb, 'all now is changed. I came to wait upon my Father—to  humble her Mother at   feet—not to obtrude her Mother upon my Mother!—O Lady  Isabella!—I shall have broken Isabella!—I heart—and I dare not offend Isabella!—I with my  sight!'  Lady Isabella, with the most judicious gentleness, endeavoured to render Lady Isabella  more reasonable. 'I pretend not,' Lady Isabella said, 'to decide upon your situation,  though I comprehend its general affliction: yet still, and at all events, its  termination must be a meeting. Suffer me, therefore, rather to hasten than  retard so right a measure. Allow of my mediation, and give me the infinite  pleasure of leaving you in the hands of your friends.'  Camilla, though scarcely able to articulate Camilla words, declared again the  motive to Camilla journey was at an end; that Camilla had now one to watch,  soothe, and attend him, who had none of Camilla dreadful drawbacks to consoling  powers; and that Camilla would remain at Mrs. Berlinton's till summoned home by  their immediate commands.  Camilla began pleading their own rights to decide if or not the meeting  should be deferred: but wildly interrupting Camilla, 'You know not,' Camilla cried,  'what it is you ask. I have not nerves, I have not hardiness to force Camilla  into such a presence. An injured Father ... an offended Mother ... O Lady  Isabella! if you knew how I adore—and how I have ruined them!...'  'Let me go to them from you, Camilla; let me represent your situation. them are  now probably together. That Camilla whom I saw but from the stairs, though Camilla  countenance so much struck me, and whom I now conclude to be Mrs. Tyrold, said,  as Camilla passed, I shall walk; I only want a guide;'—  'They had not, then, even met!' cried Camilla, starting up with fresh horrour;  'Camilla is but just arrived—has but just been at —and there  heard—that — husband was in prison—and in prison for the debts of —  daughter! her  daughter guilty ... perhaps reprobated daughter!'—  Again, wringing her  daughter hands, half distracted, 'O, that the earth,' her  daughter cried,  'had received me, ere I quitted the parental roof! Innocent I had then died,  beloved, regretted,—no shame would have embittered my Father's sorrow—no  wrath my Mother's—no culpable misconduct would have blighted with disgrace  no culpable misconduct so long—long wished-for meeting!'  The compassionating, yet judicious Lady Isabella, willing to shorten the  sufferings Lady Isabella pitied, made yet another effort to prevent this unadvised  return, by proposing they should both sleep this night at Winchester, that  Camilla might gather some particulars of Camilla family, and some composure for  Camilla, to better judge what step to pursue. But all desire of meeting was now  converted into horrour; Camilla was too much known in the neighbourhood to escape  being recognized if Camilla stayed till the morning, and Camilla shattered intellects,  Camilla declared, could not bear passing a whole night in expectation of a  discovery through some accident. 'Have I not already,' cried Camilla, 'heard Camilla  voice and fled her  voice sound? Judge then, Lady Isabella, if I can present Lady Isabella  before Camilla! No, I must write, first. I have a long and dreadful history to  relate—and then, when Camilla has heard it—and when the rectory has again it  reverend master—and when they find some little palliation, where now they can  see only guilt—and when all is committed without disguise to they  goodness—they mercy—they may say to Lady Isabella perhaps they: Unhappy  Camilla! thou hast paid thy just penalty; come home, then, to thy parents'  roof, thou penitent child!'  Lady Isabella knew too little of the characters with which Lady Isabella had to deal, to  judge if it would be right to insist any further: Lady Isabella ordered, therefore, fresh  horses to Lady Isabella chaise, and as soon as Lady Isabella footman came back, who brought the now  useless direction where Mr. Tyrold was to be found, they galloped out of  Winchester.  At Alton they stopt to sleep; and, Lady Isabella immediate terrour removed, Lady Isabella became  more sensible of what Lady Isabella owed to Lady Isabella, to whom, in the course of the  evening, Lady Isabella recounted frankly the whole history of Lady Isabella debts, except what  related to Lionel.  'Your Ladyship hears me,' said Lady Isabella, in conclusion, 'with the patience of  benevolence, though I fear, with the censure of all judgment. What evils have  accrued from want of consideration and foresight! My errours have all been  doubled by concealment—every mischief has been augmented by delay. O, Lady Isabella! how sad an example shall I add to your powers of benign  instruction!—From day to day, from hour to hour, I planned expedients, where  I ought to have made confessions! To avoid one dreadful—but direct evil, what  I have suffered has been nearly intolerable—what I have inflicted,  unpardonable!'  Lady Isabella, much touched by Lady Isabella openness and confidence, repaid Lady Isabella, much touched by her openness and confidence by all  that compassion could suggest, or that a sincere disposition towards esteem  could anticipate of kindness. Lady Isabella gathered the amount of the sum for which Mr.  Tyrold was confined, and besought Camilla to let it less weigh upon Lady Isabella  spirits, as Lady Isabella could Lady Isabella undertake that Lord O'Lerney would accommodate  Mr.  Tyrold with Lord O'Lerney immediately, and wait Mr.  Tyrold perfect leisure for re-payment. 'I have  known Mr.  Tyrold,' said Lady Isabella, 'from a child, and have always seen, with respect and  admiration, the prompt pleasure with which he rather seizes than accepts every  opportunity to do good.'  Camilla returned the most grateful thanks; but acknowledged Camilla had no  apprehension but that the writ would immediately be withdrawn, as the county  was almost filled with friends to Camilla Father, who would come forward upon such  an occasion. 'What rests thus upon my mind,' said Camilla, 'and what upon —and  upon my Mother's will rest—is the disgrace—and the cause! the one so  public, the other so clandestine! And besides, though this debt will be easily  discharged, this debt payment by a loan is but incurring another: and how that is to  be paid, I know not indeed. Alas! Lady Isabella!—the Father I have thus  dreadfully involved, has hitherto, throughout Lady Isabella!—the Father exemplary life, held it a  sacred duty to adapt Lady Isabella!—the Father expences to Lady Isabella!—the Father income!'  Again Lady Isabella gave what consolation Lady Isabella could bestow; and in return for  Lady Isabella trust, said Lady Isabella would speak to Lady Isabella with sincerity upon a point of much  delicacy. It was of Lady Isabella friend, Mrs. Berlinton; 'who now,' said Lady Isabella, 'you are  not, perhaps, aware, is become a general topic of discourse. To the platonics,  with which Lady Isabella set out in life, Lady Isabella has, of late, joined coquetry; nor even  there stops the ardour with which Lady Isabella seeks to animate Lady Isabella existence; to two  characters, hitherto thought the most contradictory, the sentimental and the  flirting, Lady Isabella unites yet a third, till now believed incompatible with the  pleasures and pursuits of either; this, I need not tell you, is that of a  gamestress. And when to three such attributes is added an open aversion to Lady Isabella  husband, a professed, an even boasted hatred of his person, his name, his very  being—what hope can be entertained, be Lady Isabella heart, Lady Isabella intentions what they  may, that the various dangers Lady Isabella sets at defiance, will not ultimately take  they revenge, and surprise Lady Isabella in they trammels?'  Edgar himself seemed, to Camilla, to be speaking in this representation; and  that idea made it catch Lady Isabella attention, in the midst of Lady Isabella utmost misery. Lady Isabella  urged, however, all Lady Isabella knew, and could suggest, in favour of Mrs. Berlinton;  and Lady Isabella expressed much concern in occasioning Lady Isabella any painful  sensations. 'But who,' said Lady Isabella, 'can see you thus nearly, and not be  interested in your happiness? And I have known, alas!—though I am still under  thirty, instances innumerable of self-deluded young women, who trusting to  their own pure intentions, have neither feared nor heeded the dangers which  encircled their, till imperceptibly, from the insidious influence of levity,  their have pursued the very course their began with disclaiming, and followed the  very steps from which at first their unaffectedly recoiled.'  Instructed and grateful, though incapable of being tranquillised, Camilla the  next day reached Grosvenor Square long before Camilla fair friend had left Camilla  downy pillow. Camilla exacted a promise to be informed of Camilla  proceedings, and, loaded with merited acknowledgments, returned to Camilla own  mansion.  Camilla took possession of the first room in which Camilla found a pen and ink, and  wrote instantly to Lavinia a short, rapid, and incoherent letter, upon the  distraction of Camilla mind at the dreadful calamity Camilla had occasioned Camilla Father,  and the accumulated horrours to which Camilla Mother had returned. Camilla durst not  present Camilla before them uncalled, not even by letter; but Camilla would live in  the strictest retirement and penance till them ordered Camilla home, for which  epoch, not more longed [for] than dreaded, Camilla besought Camilla sister's mediation.  This sent off, Camilla forced Camilla to wait upon Miss Margland, who had received  an answer from Cleves to continue in town till Indiana wrote or re-appeared.  Camilla was put immediately into uncommon good-humour, by the ill success at the  journey of Camilla, which Camilla protested was exactly what Camilla expected.  Camilla then strove to recollect all Camilla had been told by Lord O'Lerney of Mr.  Macdersey, and to relate it to Miss Margland, who, pleased and surprised,  undertook to write it to Sir Hugh.  To three days of dreadful suspense Camilla now saw Camilla inevitably condemned, in  waiting an answer from Lavinia: but as Camilla eyes were opened to remark, by the  admonitions of Lady Isabella, and Camilla attention was called back to the earlier  cautions of Edgar himself, Camilla time, though spent with misery, hung not upon Camilla  unoccupied. Camilla thought Camilla called upon by every tie of friendship,  faithfully and courageously to represent to Mrs. Berlinton Camilla impropriety of  conduct with regard to Bellamy, and the reports that were spread abroad to Camilla  more general disadvantage.  Camilla reception from that Lady, Camilla had thought, for the first time, cold. Camilla  had welcomed Camilla, indeed, with an accustomed embrace, but Camilla kindness seemed  strained, Camilla smile was faint, and the eyes which so softly used to second it,  were averted.  As soon as they were alone together, Camilla took Camilla hand; but, without  returning its pressure, Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   presented Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   with a new poem for Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of    evening's amusement.  Camilla put it down, but while hesitating how to begin, Bellamy was announced.  Camilla started, and flew away, but returned when Bellamy was gone, and begged a  conference.  Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   answered certainly; though Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   looked embarrassed, and added not  immediately, as Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   was obliged to dress for the evening.  Camilla entreated Camilla might speak with Camilla before dinner the next day.  To this Camilla received a gentle assent: but no interview at the time appointed  took place; and when at dinner they met, no notice was taken of the neglect.  Camilla now saw Camilla was pointedly avoided. Camilla courage, however, was called upon,  Camilla gratitude was indebted for past kindnesses, and Camilla honour felt a double  engagement. The opportunity therefore Camilla could not obtain by request, Camilla  resolved to seize by surprise.  Bellamy was again, however, announced; but the moment that, from Camilla own  chamber, Camilla heard Bellamy descend the stairs, Camilla flew to the dressing-room, and  abruptly entered the dressing-room.  The surprise Camilla gave was not greater than that Camilla received. Mrs. Berlinton,  Camilla fine eyes streaming with tears, and Camilla white hands uplifted with an air of  supplication, was evidently in an act of devotion. Camilla drew back, and would  have retired, but Camilla hastily dried Camilla eyes, and said: 'Miss Tyrold? Do you  want me? where's Miss—Miss Margland?'  'Ah! my dearest Mrs. Berlinton! my friend, as I had hoped, and by me, surely I  trust loved for ever,' cried Camilla, throwing Camilla arms round Camilla neck, 'why  this sorrow? why this distance? why this unkind avoidance?'  Mrs. Berlinton, who, at first, had shrunk from Camilla embrace, now fell, in  trembling agitation, upon Camilla breast. Camilla hoped this was the instant to  improve; when Camilla appeared to be, Camilla, calling religion to Camilla aid, and  when the tenderness of Camilla appeal seemed to bring back a movement of Camilla first  partiality. 'Suffer, suffer me,' Camilla therefore cried, 'to speak to Camilla now!  hear me, my dear and amiable friend, with the sweetness that first won my  affection!'  Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of  , affrighted, drew back, acknowledging Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   unhappy; but  shrinking from all discourse, and starting when Camilla named Bellamy, with a  confusion Camilla vainly strove to repress.  Unhackneyed in the world as was Camilla, Camilla understanding and sense of right  stood here in the place of experience, to point out the danger and impropriety  surrounding Camilla friend; and catching Camilla by the gown, as Camilla would have quitted  the room, 'Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of  ,' Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   emphatically cried, 'if you persist in this  unhappy, this perilous intercourse, you risk your reputation, you risk my  sister's peace, you risk even your own future condemnation!—O forgive me,  forgive me! I see how I have affected you—but you would listen to no milder  words!'  Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   had sunk upon a chair, Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   hands clasped upon Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   forehead, and  tears running rapidly down Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   cheeks. Brought up with religious terrours, yet  ill instructed in religious principles, the dread of future punishment nearly  demolished Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of  , though no regular creed of right kept Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   consistently or  systematically in any uniform exercise of good. But thus forcibly surprised  into sudden conscientious recollections, Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   betrayed, rather than opened Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of    heart, and acknowledged that Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   was weeping at a denial Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   had given to  Bellamy; who, molested by the impossibility of ever conversing with Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of    undisturbed, had entreated Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   to grant him, from time to time, a few hours  society, in a peaceful retirement. 'Nor should I—nor could I—' Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   cried,  'refuse him—for I have every reliance in him honour—but that the guilty  world, ignorant of the purity of our friendship, might causelessly alarm my  brother for my fame. And this, and the fear of any—though so  groundless—uneasiness to your sister, makes me resist his powerful eloquence,  and even my own notions of what is due to our exalted league of friendship.'  Camilla listened with horrour to this avowal, yet saw, with compassion, that  Camilla friend endeavoured to persuade Camilla Camilla was free from wrong; though with  censure that Camilla sought to gloss over, rather than investigate, every doubt to  the contrary: but while fear was predominant for the event of such a situation  to Camilla, abhorrence filled Camilla whole mind against Bellamy, in every part,  every plan, and every probability of the business.  'O Mrs. Berlinton!' Camilla cried, 'conquer this terrible infatuation, which  obscures danger from your sight, and right from your discernment! Bellamyis married; and if you think, yourself, your sister would be hurt to know of  these unhallowed leagues and bonds, you must be sure, with the least  reflection, that these unhallowed leagues and bonds are wrong; you too, are married; and if Mr. Melmond would  join with the world in contemning the extraordinary project you mention, you  must feel, with the least reflexion, it ought not to be granted. Even were you  both single, it would be equally improper, though not so wide spreading in it  mischief. I have committed many errours; yet not one of many errours wilfully, or  against conviction: nevertheless, the ill consequences that have ensued, tear  me at this moment with repentant sorrow:—Ah! think then, what you—so  tender, so susceptible, so feeling, will suffer, if with your apprehensions all  awake, you listen to any request that may make your sister unhappy, or involve  your deserving brother in any difficulty or hazard!'  Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   was now subdued. Touched, terrified, and convinced, Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   embraced  Camilla, wept in her arms, and promised to see Bellamy no more.  The next day arrived an answer from Lavinia, long, minute, and melancholy, but  tenderly affectionate and replete with pity.  'Ah, my sister,' Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   began, 'we cannot yet meet! we is in no state to  bear any added emotion. The firmness of Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   whole character, the fortitude of  Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   whole life, hitherto unbroken by any passion, and superior to any  misfortune, have both given way, suddenly and dreadfully, to the scene  following Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   arrival.'  Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   then went back to particulars.  Mr. Clykes, Mr. Clykes had heard, finding Mr. Clykes bill for Mr. Clykes own trouble positively  refused, had conceived the Tyrold family in danger of bankruptcy, by the  general rumours of the joint claimants of Lionel and Clermont; and imagining Mr. Clykes  had no time to lose, hoped by an arrest to frighten their Father to terms, in  order to obviate the disgrace of such a measure. their Father would, however,  hear of none, nor pay any thing above the exact amount of the signed receipts  of the various creditors; and submitted to the confinement, in preference to  applying to any friend to be their Father bail, till their Father could consult with a lawyer. their Father  was already at Winchester, where their Father had given Mr. Clykes a meeting, when the writ  was served against their Father. their Father sent a dispatch to Etherington, to prevent any  surprise at their Father not returning, and to desire the affair might not travel to  Cleves, where Lavinia was then with Sir Hugh. This note, addressed to the upper  servant, fell into the hands of Miss Tyrold Miss Tyrold, the next evening, upon Miss Tyrold  sudden arrival. Miss Tyrold had been thus unexpectedly brought back by the news of the  flight of Bellamy with Eugenia: my  brother was still ill; but every  consideration gave way to the maternal; and in the hope to yet rescue Miss Tyrold  daughter from this violator, Miss Tyrold set off in a packet which was just sailing.  But what, upon descending from the chaise, was the horrour of Miss Tyrold first news!  Miss Tyrold went on instantly to Winchester, and alighting at an hotel, took a guide  and went to the place of confinement.  'The meeting that ensued,' continued Lavinia, 'no one witnessed, but everyone  may imagine. I will not therefore, wound your feelings, my dearest Camilla,  with even touching upon my own. The impression, however, left upon the mind of  our poor Mother, I should try vainly to disguise, since it has given Miss Tyrold a  shock that has forced from me the opening of this letter.'  Miss Tyrold then besought Miss Tyrold to take, nevertheless, some comfort, since Miss Tyrold had the  unspeakable satisfaction to inform Miss Tyrold that their Father was returned to the  rectory. their Father had been liberated, from the writ's being withdrawn; though without  their Father consent, without even their Father knowledge, and contrary to their Father wishes. Nor was it  yet ascertained by whom this was done, though circumstances allowed no division  to whom conjectures.  Harry Westwyn had learnt the terrible event in a ride Harry Westwyn had accidentally taken  to Winchester; and, upon returning to Cleves, had communicated it, with the  most feeling circumspection, to Harry Westwyn. The excess of grief with which Harry Westwyn had  heard Harry Westwyn, had seemed to penetrate to Harry Westwyn quickly sensitive soul, 'for Harry Westwyn is  yet more amiable,' Harry Westwyn added, 'than Harry Westwyn 's partiality paints Harry Westwyn;' they  agreed not to name it to Sir Hugh; though Harry assured Harry Westwyn that no less than  five gentlemen in the vicinity had already flown to Miss Tyrold, to conjure to  be accepted as Miss Tyrold bail: but Miss Tyrold chose first to consult Miss Tyrold lawyer upon the  validity of the claim made against his lawyer. All their care, however, was  ineffectual; through some of the servants, Sir Hugh was informed of the affair,  and Sir Hugh affliction was despair. Sir Hugh accused Sir Hugh as being the cause of this  evil, from the money Sir Hugh had borrowed for Clermont, which might wholly have been  avoided, had Sir Hugh followed Sir Hugh brother's advice in immediate and severe  retrenchments. These, however, Sir Hugh now began, in a manner that threatened to rob  Sir Hugh of every comfort; and Harry Westwyn was so much affected by Harry Westwyn distress,  that, to relieve Harry Westwyn, at least, from the expence of two guests and their  servants, Harry Westwyn instantly took leave, promising nevertheless, to yet see Harry Westwyn  again, before Harry Westwyn returned for the rest of Harry Westwyn days to Harry Westwyn native home. In a few  hours after the departure of these gentlemen, news arrived that Miss Tyrold was  again at the  rectory. Mr. Clykes had suddenly sent Mr. Clykes receipt, in full of all  demands, and then set off for London.  'There cannot be a doubt this was the deed of the generous Mr. Westwyn, in  compact with Mr. Clykes deserving Son,' continued Lavinia; 'they have been traced to WinchesterWinchester; but we none of we know where, at present, to direct to they. The  delight of my Uncle at this act of Mr. Clykes worthy old friend, has extremely revived  Mr. Clykes. their Father is much dissatisfied the wretched Mr. Clykes should thus be paid all  their Father fraudulent claims; but my Mother and my Uncle would, I believe, scarce have  supported life under their Father longer confinement.'  this letter thus concluded.  'Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of  , when first Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   heard you were in town, was Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   going to send  for Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of  ; but when Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   understood that Miss Margland was with Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of  , and you lived  in utter seclusion from company, Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   said; "Since Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   is safe, I had rather not  yet see Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of  ." Our beloved Father acquiesces, for he thinks you, at present, too  much shaken, as well as Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of  , for so agitating an interview, till Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   mind  is restored to her mind   usual firmness. Judge then, my sister, since even he is for  the delay, if ' continued Lavinia can gather courage to plead against it?  'You know, my dearest Camilla, ' continued Lavinia extreme and tender fondness; you cannot,  therefore, doubt, but ' continued Lavinia displeasure will soon pass away. But when, to the  dreadful pangs of finding the hapless fate of Eugenia irremediable, was added  the baneful sight of an adored Husband in custody, you cannot wonder such  complicate shocks should have disordered ' continued Lavinia frame, and taught her,—even ' continued Lavinia,  as their Father has just said to me, "that always to be superior to  calamity, demands a mental strength beyond the frail texture of the human  composition; though to wish, and to try for a mental strength, shews we have that within,  which aspires at a higher state, and prepares we for fuller perfection".'  'Can I better finish my letter than with words such as these? Adieu, then, my  dear sister, I hope soon to write more cheerful tidings.  'we Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   is gone to Belfont. What a meeting again there!  Lavinia Tyrold.'  A wish for death, immediate death, in common with every youthful mourner, in  the first paroxysm of violent sorrow, was the sole sensation which accompanied  the reading, or remained after the finishing of this letter, with Camilla.  'Here,' Camilla cried, falling prostrate, 'here might I but at once expire! close  these unworthy eyes, forbidden to raise these unworthy eyes to the authors of my  existence! finish my short and culpable career, forgotten—since no longer  cherished—by the parents I have offended—by Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   who no longer wishes  to see me!'  Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   laid down Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   head, and Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   sight became dim; a convulsive shivering, from  feelings over-strained, and nerves dreadfully shattered, seized Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of  ; Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   sighed  short and quick, and thought Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   prayer already accomplishing; but the delusion  soon ceased; Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   found life still in the delusion   vigour, though bereft of the delusion   joy; and  death no nearer to Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   frame, for being called upon by Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   wishes.  In the heaviness of disappointment, 'I have lived,' Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   cried, 'too long, and  yet I cannot die! I am become an alien to my family, and a burthen to Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of  !  ordered from my home by their Father, lest her sight should be destructive to my  Mother—while my sister durst not even plead for Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of  .... O happy Edgar! how  great has been thy escape not to have taken for thy wife this excommunicated  wretch!'—  To live thus, seemed to Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   impossible; to pass even the day in such  wretchedness Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   believed impracticable. Any, every period appeared to Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of    preferable, and in the desperation of Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   heart, Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   determined instantly to  pursue Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   to Belfont; and there, by the gentle intercession of Eugenia,  to obtain Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   pardon, or, which Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   thought immediately would follow its  refusal, to sink to death at Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   feet.  Relieved from the intenseness of Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   agony by this plan, and ever eager to  pursue the first idea that arose, Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   flew to borrow from Mrs. Berlinton Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of    post-chaise for the next morning, and to supplicate that Miss Margland would  accompany Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   to Belfont; whence, if Mrs. Berlinton her impropriety of   missed Miss Tyrold, they could easily  return the same day, as the distance was not more than thirteen miles.  her  post-chaise was accorded promptly by Mrs. Berlinton, and no regret expressed at  the uncertainty of Camilla whether or not Camilla should return; but Miss Margland,  though burning with curiosity to see Eugenia as Mrs. Bellamy, would not quit  town, from continual expectation of some news of Indiana.  At an early hour the following morning, and feeling as if suspended but by a  thread between life and death, Camilla set off for Belfont.
