 A Barn  The first care of Camilla was to interest Sir Hugh in the misfortunes of the  prisoner and his family; her next, to relate the invitation of Mrs. Arlbery,  and to beg permission that she might wait upon the lady the next morning, with  apologies for her abrupt retreat, and with acknowledgments for the services  done to the poor woman; which first the Oxonian, and then the raffle, had  driven from her mind. Sir Hugh readily consented, blaming her for supposing it  possible he could ever hesitate in what could give her any pleasure.  Before the tea-party broke up, Edgar returned. He told Camilla he had stolen  away the instant the dinner was over, to avoid any mistake about the poor  people, whom he had just overtaken by the park-gate, and conducted to the great  barn, where he had directed them to wait for orders.  'I'll run to them immediately,' cried she, 'for my half guinea is in an agony  to be gone!'  'The barn! my dear young Mr. Mandlebert!' exclaimed Sir Hugh; 'and why did you  not bring them to the servants' hall? My little girl has been telling me all  their history; and, God forbid, I should turn hard-hearted, because of their  wanting a leg of mutton, in preference to being starved; though they might have  no great right to it, according to the forms of law; which, however, is not  much impediment to the calls of nature, when a man sees a butcher's stall well  covered, and has got nothing within him, except his own poor craving appetite;  which is a thing I always take into consideration; though, God forbid, I should  protect a thief, no man's property being another's, whether he's poor or rich.'  He then gave Camilla three guineas to deliver to them from himself, to set them  a little a-going in an honest way, that they might not, he said, repent leaving  off bad actions. Her joy was so excessive, that she passionately embraced his  knees: and Edgar, while he looked on, could nearly have bent to her his own,  with admiration of her generous nature. Eugenia desired to accompany her; and  Indiana, rising also, said: 'Dear! I wonder how they will look in the barn! I  should like to see them too.'  Miss Margland made no opposition, and they set out.  Camilla, leading the way, with a fleetness that mocked all equality, ran into  the barn, and saw the whole party, according to their several powers, enjoying  themselves. The poor man, stretched upon straw, was resting his aching limbs;  his wife, by his side, was giving nourishment to her baby; and the other child,  a little boy of three years old, was jumping and turning head over heels, with  the true glee of unspoilt nature, superior to poverty and distress.  To the gay heart of Camilla whatever was sportive was attractive; she flew to  the little fellow, whose skin was clean and bright, in the midst of his rags  and wretchedness, and, making herself his play-mate, bid the woman finish  feeding her child, told the man to repose himself undisturbed, and began  dancing with the little boy, not less delighted than himself at the festive  exercise.  Miss Margland cast up her hands and eyes as she entered, and poured forth a  warm remonstrance against so demeaning a condescension: but Camilla, in whose  composition pride had no share, though spirit was a principal ingredient,  danced on unheeding, to the equal amaze and enchantment of the poor man and  woman, at the honour done to their little son.  Edgar came in last; he had given his arm to Eugenia, who was always in the rear  if unassisted. Miss Margland appealed to him upon the impropriety of the  behaviour of Camilla, adding, 'If I had had the bringing up a young lady who  could so degrade herself, I protest I should blush to shew my face: but you  cannot, I am sure, fail remarking the difference of Miss Lynmere's conduct.'  Edgar attended with an air of complacency, which he thought due to the  situation of Miss Margland in the family, yet kept his eyes fixt upon Camilla,  with an expression that, to the least discernment, would have evinced his  utmost approbation of her innocent gaiety: but Miss Margland was amongst that  numerous tribe, who, content as well as occupied with making observations upon  others, have neither the power, nor thought, of developing those that are  returned upon themselves.  Camilla at length, wholly out of breath, gave over; but perceiving that the  baby was no longer at its mother's breast, flew to the poor woman, and, taking  the child in her arms, said: 'Come, I can nurse and rest at the same time; I  assure you the baby will be safe with me, for I nurse all the children in our  neighbourhood.' She then fondled the poor little half-starved child to her  bosom, quieting, and kissing, and cooing over it.  Miss Margland was still more incensed; but Edgar could attend to her no longer.  Charmed with the youthful nurse, and seeing in her unaffected attitudes, a  thousand graces he had never before remarked, and reading in her fondness for  children the genuine sweetness of her character, he could not bear to have the  pleasing reflections revolving in his mind interrupted by the spleen of Miss  Margland, and, slipping away, posted himself behind the baby's father, where he  could look on undisturbed, certain it was a vicinity to which Miss Margland  would not follow him.  Had this scene lasted till Camilla was tired, its period would not have been  very short; but Miss Margland, finding her exhortations vain, suddenly called  out: 'Miss Lynmere! Miss Eugenia! come away directly! It's ten to one but these  people have all got the gaol distemper!'  Edgar, quick as lightning at this sound, flew to Camilla, and snatched the  child from her arms. Indiana, with a scream, ran out of the barn; Miss Margland  hurried after; and Eugenia, following, earnestly entreated Camilla not to stay  another moment.  'And what is there to be alarmed at?' cried she; 'I always nurse poor children  when I see them at home; and my father never prohibits me.'  'There may be some reason, however,' said Edgar, while still he tenderly held  the baby himself, 'for the present apprehension: I beg you, therefore, to  hasten away.'  'At least,' said she, 'before I depart, let me execute my commission.' And  then, with the kindest good wishes for their better fortune, she put her  uncle's three guineas into the hands of the poor man, and her own rescued half  guinea into those of his wife; and, desiring Edgar not to remain himself where  he would not suffer her to stay, ran to give her arm to Eugenia; leaving it a  doubtful point, whether the good humour accompanying her alms, made the most  pleased impression upon their receivers, or upon their observer.
