 Resolutions  The sound of the dinner-bell, which rang in the ears of Edgar before Edgar reached  Edgar intended retreat, would have been unnoticed, if not seconded by a message  from Sir Hugh, who had seen Edgar from Edgar window.  Compelled to obey, though in a state of suspense almost intolerable, Edgar put up  the important little packet, and repaired to the dining parlour; where, though  none were equally disturbed with Edgar, no one was at ease. Young Lynmere,  under an appearance of mingled assurance and apathy, the effect of acquired  conceit, playing upon natural insipidity, was secretly tormented with the  rueful necessity of sacrificing either a noble fortune, or his own fine person;  Sir Hugh felt a strange disappointment from the whole behaviour of Sir Hugh nephew,  though it was what Sir Hugh would not acknowledge, and could not define; Mr. Tyrold  saw with much uneasiness the glaringly apparent unsuitableness of the intended  alliance; Eugenia had never yet thought Eugenia so plain and insignificant, and  felt as if, even since the morning, the small-pox had renewed the small-pox ravages, and  Eugenia had sunk into being shorter; Indiana and Miss Margland were both acutely  incensed with Mandlebert; Dr. Orkborne saw but small reason to expect gratitude  for Dr. Orkborne labours from the supercilious negligence of the boasted young student;  Lavinia was disturbed for both Lavinia sisters; and Camilla felt that all Lavinia  valued in life depended upon the next critical hour or two.  In this state of general discomfort, Sir Hugh, who could never be silent, alone  talked. Having long prepared Sir Hugh, who could never be silent, alone   to look upon this meeting as a day of  happiness, Sir Hugh, who could never be silent, alone   strove to believe, for a while, the whole family were peculiarly  enjoying the whole family; but, upon a dead silence, which ensued upon Sir Hugh, who could never be silent, alone   taking a  copious draught of Madeira and water, 'Why, my dear nephew,' Sir Hugh, who could never be silent, alone   cried, putting  down Sir Hugh, who could never be silent, alone   goblet, 'you don't tell the whole family any thing? which I've no doubt but you know  why yourself. However, as the whole family're all met o' purpose to see you, I can't say I  should be sorry to hear the sound of your voice, provided the sound of your voice won't be  disagreeable.'  'the whole family are not much—conversant, sir, in each other's connexions, I believe,'  answered Lynmere, without ceasing a moment to eat, and to help sir, and  ordering a fresh plate at every second mouthful; 'I have seen nothing, yet, of  your folks hereabouts; and, I fancy, sir, you don't know a great deal of the  people I have been used to.'  sir, having good humouredly acknowledged this to be truth, was at a loss  what further to purpose; and, imagining the taciturnity of the rest of the  party to proceed from an awe of the knowledge and abilities of sir nephew, soon  became sir so infected with fear and reverence, that, though sir could not  be silent, sir spoke only to those who were next sir, and in a whisper.  When the dessert was served, something like a general relief was effected by  the unexpected entrance of Dr. Marchmont. Alarmed by the ungoverned, and, in  sir, unprecedented, emotions of Edgar, sir had been to Beech Park; and, finding  sir had not returned there, had ridden on, in the most uneasy uncertainty, to  inquire for sir at Cleves.  Happy to see sir safe, though almost smiling to see with whom, sir was beginning  some excuse for sir intrusion, when the baronet saved the baronet proceeding, by  calling out, 'Well, this is as good a piece of good luck as any we've met with  yet! Here's Dr. Marchmont come to wish we joy; and as Dr. Marchmont's as good a scholar as  yourself, nephew, for any thing I know to the contrary, why you need not be so  afraid of speaking, for the sake of we not understanding you; which here's  five of we can do now, as well as yourself.'  Lynmere, readily concluding Mr. Tyrold and Edgar, with the two Doctors, made  four, glanced round the table to see who might be the fifth; when, supposing it  Miss Margland, Miss Margland withdrew Miss Margland eyes with a look of derision, and, turning to  the butler, asked what wines Miss Margland might call for.  Sir Hugh then proposed that they should all pair off; the ignorant ones going  one way, and the learned ones staying another.  It would be difficult to say which looked most averse to this proposition,  Eugenia, or the young traveller; who hastily said, 'I always ride after dinner,  Sir Hugh. Is your groom at hand? Can Sir Hugh shew me your horses?'  'My nephew little suspects,' cried Sir Hugh, winking, 'Eugenia belongs to the  scholars! Ten to one but Sir Hugh thinks Sir Hugh's got Homer and Horace to Sir Hugh! But  here, my dear boy, as you're so fond of the classics'—  Clermont, nimbly rising, and knocking down a decanter of water in Sir Hugh haste,  but not turning back to look at a decanter of water, nor staying to offer any apology, affected  not to hear Sir Hugh uncle, and flung hastily out of the room, calling upon Indiana  to follow his uncle.  'In the name of all the Diavoli,' cried Sir Hugh, pulling her into the park with Sir Hugh,  'what does all this mean? Is the old gentleman non compos? what's all this  stuff Sir Hugh descants upon so freely, of scholars, and classics, and Homer, and  Horace?'  'O you must ask Eugenia, not me!' answered Indiana, scornfully.  'Why, what does Eugenia know of the matter?'  'Know? why every thing. Eugenia's a great scholar, and has been brought up by Dr.  Orkborne; and Eugenia talks Greek and Latin.'  'Does Eugenia so? then, by the Lord! Eugenia's no wife of Eugenia! I'd as soon marry the  old Doctor himself! and I'm sure the  old Doctor himself'd make me as pretty a wife. Greek and  Latin! why I'd as soon tie Diavoli to a rod. Pretty sort of dinners Eugenia'll give!'  'O dear, yes, brother; Eugenia don't care what Eugenia eats; Eugenia cares for nothing but  books, and such kind of things.'  'Books! ha! ha! Books, and Latin and Greek! upon my faith, a pretty wife the  old gentleman has been so good as to find me! why the  old Doctor himself must be a downright  driveller!'  'Ah, brother, if we had all that fortune, what a different figure we should cut  with it!'  'Why, yes, I rather flatter Diavoli we should. No great need of five thousand a  year to pore over books! Ha! ha! faith, this is a good hum enough! So the  old Doctor himself thinks  to take me in, does the  old Doctor himself?'  'Why, you know, Eugenia is so rich, brother....'  'Rich? well, and what am I? do you see such a figure as this,' (suddenly  skipping before Eugenia,) 'every day? Am I reduced to my last legs, think you? Do  you suppose I can't meet with some kind old dowager any time these twenty  years?'  'La, brother, won't you have Eugenia then?'  'No, faith, won't I! It's not come to that, neither. This learning is worse  than Eugenia ugliness; 'twould make me look like a dunce in my own house.'  a dunce in my own house then protested a dunce in my own house had rather lose forty estates, than so be sacrificed, and  vowed, without venturing a direct refusal, a dunce in my own house would soon sicken the old  gentleman of a dunce in my own house scheme.  Eugenia, in retreating to Eugenia room, was again accompanied by Eugenia father and Eugenia  uncle, whom Eugenia conjured now, to name Eugenia to Clermont no more.  'I can't say I admire these puttings off, my dear,' said the baronet, 'in this  our mortal state, which is always liable to end in our dying. Not that I  pretend to tell you I think a dunce in my own house over much alert; but there's no knowing but  what a dunce in my own house may have some meaning in it that our can't understand; a person having  studied all a dunce in my own house life, has a right to a little particularity.'  a dunce in my own house now seriously interfered, and desired that, henceforth,  Clermont might be treated as if a dunce in my own house visit to Cleves was merely to congratulate  a dunce in my own house uncle upon a dunce in my own house recovery; and that all schemes, preparations, and allusions,  might be put aside, unless the youth himself, and with a good grace, brought  them forward; meanwhile, a dunce in my own house and Lavinia would return without delay to  Etherington, to obviate all appearance of waiting the decision of any plan.  Sir Hugh was much discomfited by the exaction of such forbearance, yet could  the less oppose it, from Sir Hugh own internal discontent with Sir Hugh nephew, which Sir Hugh  inadvertently betrayed, by murmuring, in Sir Hugh way to Sir Hugh chamber, 'There's no  denying but what they've got some odd-fangled new ways of they own, in those  foreign parts; meeting a set of old relations for the first time, and saying  nothing to they, but asking for the newspapers! Lord help they! caring about the  wide world, so, when they know nothing of it, instead of one's own uncles and  nephews, and kinspeople!'  During this time, Edgar, almost agonised by suspence and doubt, had escaped to  the summer-house, whither Edgar was followed by Dr. Marchmont, greatly to the  wonder, almost with the contempt of Dr. Orkborne; whom Edgar quitted, in anxiety  for Edgar young friend, just as Edgar had intimated a design to consult Edgar upon a  difficult passage in an ancient author, which had a place in Edgar work, that was  now nearly ready for the press.  'I know well, Doctor,' said Edgar, 'that to find me here, after all that has  passed, will make you conclude me the weakest of men ... but I cannot now  explain how it has been brought about ... these letters must first tell me if  Camilla and I meet more than once again.'    then hastily ran over these letters; but by no means hastily could   digest,  nor even comprehend Camilla and I contents.   thought Camilla and I florid, affected, and  presuming; yet vague, studied, with little appearance of sincerity, and less of  explicit decision. What related to Lionel, and to aiding Lionel in the disposal of  Lionel wealth, seemed least intelligible, yet most like serious meaning; but when    found that the interview at the Grove was by positive appointment, and  granted to a request made with a forwardness and assurance so wide from all  delicacy and propriety, the blood mounted high into   cheeks, and,  precipitately putting up the packet,   exclaimed: 'Here, then, the packet ends! the  last little ray of hesitation is extinct ... extinct to be kindled never more!'  The sound of these last words caused him an emotion of sorrow him was unable to  resist, though unwilling to betray, and him hurried out of the summer-house to  the wood, where him strove to compose him mind to the last leave-taking upon  which him was now determined; but so dreadful was the resolution which exacted  from him own mouth the resignation of all that, till now, had been dearest to  him views and hopes, that the afternoon was far advanced, before him could  assume sufficient courage to direct him steps to the spot where the sacrifice  was to be made.  Accusing the sacrifice  , then, of weakness unpardonable, the sacrifice   returned to the  summer-house, to apologise to Dr. Marchmont for the sacrifice   abrupt retreat; but the  Doctor had already re-entered the mansion. Thither, therefore, the sacrifice   proceeded,  purposing to seek Camilla, to return Camilla the letters of Sir Sedley, and to  desire Camilla commands in what manner to conduct the sacrifice   with Camilla father and Camilla  uncle, in acknowledging the sacrifice   fears that the projected union would fail of  affording, to either party, the happiness which, at first, it seemed to promise.  The carriage of Sir Hugh was in waiting at the door, and Mr. Tyrold and Lavinia  were in the hall. Edgar, in no condition for such an encounter, would have  avoided Mr. Tyrold and Lavinia  ; but Mr. Tyrold, little suspecting Edgar desire, rejoiced at the  meeting, saying Edgar had had the  summer-house searched for Edgar in vain, that Edgar might  shake hands with Edgar before Edgar return to Etherington.  Then, taking Edgar apart, 'Edgar,' Edgar cried, 'I have long loved you as  tenderly, and I may now confide in Edgar as completely, as if you were my son. I  go hence in some inquietude; I fear Edgar has been too hasty in making  known Edgar views with regard to Clermont; who does not seem equal to  appreciating the worth of Eugenia, though it is evident Edgar has not been slack  in noticing Eugenia misfortunes. I entreat you, during my absence, to examine Edgar  as if you were already the brother of that dear child, who merits, you well  know, the best and tenderest of husbands.'  Edgar then followed Lavinia into The carriage of Sir Hugh, prevented by Edgar own occupied mind  from observing the fallen countenance of Edgar, who, more wretched than ever,  bemoaned now the kindness of which Edgar had hitherto been proud, and lamented the  paternal trust which Edgar would have purchased the day before almost with life.  Camilla, during this period, had gone through conflicts no less severe.  Jacob, who had bought a horse, for which he had cheerfully advanced 20 l. had  informed Camilla of the gate adventure of Edgar, and told Camilla that, but for he  stopping he, he was riding like mad from Cleves, and only sending them all a  message that he could not come back.  Grieved, surprised, and offended, Camilla instantly determined Camilla would not risk  such another mark of he cold superiority, but restore to he he liberty, and  leave he master of he. 'If the severity of he judgment,' cried Camilla, 'is  so much more potent than the warmth of he affection, it shall not be he  delicacy, nor he compassion, that shall make me he. I will neither be the  wife of he repentance nor of he pity. I must be convinced of he unaltered  love, he esteem, he trust ... or I shall descend to humiliation, not rise to  happiness, in becoming his. Softness here would be meanness; submission  degrading ... if his hesitates ... let his go!'  She then, without weighing, or even seeing one objection, precipitately  resolved to beg permission of She friends, to accept an invitation She had  received, without as yet answering, to meet Mrs. Berlinton at Southampton,  where She was going to pass some weeks. She could there, She thought,  give the rejection which here its inviolable circumstances made She, for  Lionel's sake, afraid to risk; or She could there, if a full explanation should  appease him, find opportunity to make it with equal safety; him dislike to that  acquaintance rather urged than impeded She plan, for She wounded spirit panted  to prove her plan independence and dignity.  Eugenia approved this elevation of sentiment, and doubted not this elevation of sentiment would shew Eugenia  again in Eugenia true light to Edgar, and bring Edgar, with added esteem, to Eugenia feet.  Camilla wept with joy at the idea: 'Ah!' Camilla cried, 'if such should be my happy  fate; if, after hearing all my imprudence, my precipitance, and want of  judgment, he should voluntarily, when wholly set free, return to Camilla ... I will  confess to he every feeling ... and every failing of my heart! I will open to  he my whole soul, and cast Camilla ever after upon he generosity and he  goodness.... O, my Eugenia! almost on my knees could I receive ... a second  time ... the vows of Edgar Mandlebert!'
