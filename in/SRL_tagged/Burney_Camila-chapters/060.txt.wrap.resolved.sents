 Ways to the Heart  All pleasure to Camilla was completely over from the moment that Edgar  disappeared.
When Camilla returned to Mount Pleasant, Mrs. Arlbery, whom Camilla found alone, said,  'Did I not understand that you were going to dance with Mr. Mandlebert?
How  chanced Edgar   to leave you?
We were kept ages waiting for the coach; and I saw Edgar    pass by, and walk off.'
Camilla, colouring, related the history of the cotillon; and said, she feared,  not knowing how she had been circumstanced, Edgar   was displeased.
'Displeased!'
cried Mrs. Arlbery, laughing; 'and do you, at seventeen, suffer a  man to be displeased?
How can you do worse when you are fifty?
Know your own  power more truly, and use your own  power more truly better.
Men, my dear, are all spoilt by humility,  and all conquered by gaiety.
Amuse and defy them!â€”attend to that maxim, and  you will have the world at your feet.'
'I have no such ambition: ... but I should be sensibly hurt to make an old  friend think ill of me.'
'When an old friend,' said Mrs. Arlbery, archly, 'happens to be a young man,  you must conduct Mrs. Arlbery, archly with a young man a little like what you are; that is, a young  woman.
And a young woman is never in a young woman proper place, if such sort of old  friends are not taught to know such sort of old  friends own.
From the instant you permit such sort of old  friends to  think of being offended, such sort of old  friends become your masters; and you will find it vastly  more convenient to make such sort of old  friends your slaves.'
Camilla pretended to understand this in a mere general sense, and wished Camilla  good night.
The next morning, at an early hour, Camilla chamber door was opened with great  suddenness, and no preparation, and Mrs. Mittin tript nimbly into the room,  with a hat in Camilla hand.
'Look here!
my dear Miss Tyrold,' cried Camilla, 'for now that other young lady has  told me your name, and I writ it down upon paper, that I might not forget it  again: look at your hat now!
Did you ever see anything so much improved for the  better?
I declare nobody would know nobody!
my dear Miss Tyrold says it's as pretty again  as it was at first.
I'll go and shew it to other young lady.'
Away other young lady went, triumphant, with the trophy of other young lady notability; but presently  returned, saying, 'Do, pray, my dear Miss Tyrold, write me down that other lady's name  upon a scrap of paper.
that other lady's name  upon a scrap of paper always goes out of my head.
And one looks as if one  knew nobody, when, one forgets people's names.'
Camilla complied, and expressed Camilla shame to have caused Camilla so much trouble.
'O, my dear, it's none at all.
I got all the things at Mrs.
Tillden's.'
'Who is Mrs.
Tillden?'
cried Camilla, staring.
'Why the milliner.
Don't you know that?'
'What things?'
asked Camilla, alarmed.
'Why these, my dear; don't you see?
Why it's all new, except just the hat  itself, and the feathers.'
Camilla was now in extreme embarrassment.
Camilla had concluded Mrs. Mittin had  only newly arranged the ornaments, and had not the smallest idea of incurring a  debt which Camilla had no means to discharge.
'It all comes to quite a trifle,' continued Mrs. Mittin, 'for all it's so  pretty.
Mrs. Tillden's things are all monstrous cheap.
I get things for next to  nothing from Camilla, sometimes, when they are a little past the mode.
But then I  recommend Camilla a heap of customers.
I get all my friends, by hook or by crook,  to go to Camilla shop.'
'And what,' stammered out Camilla, 'besides my thanks, do I owe you?'
'Oh nothing.
Camilla would not be paid; Camilla said, as you was Camilla customer, and had  all your things of Camilla at first, Camilla'd put it down in your bill for the season.'
This was, at least, some respite; though Camilla felt the disagreeable  necessity of increasing Camilla intended demand upon Mrs. Arlbery.
Miss Dennel came with a summons from that lady to the Pantiles, whither, as the  day was fine, Camilla proposed they should walk.
'O,' cried Mrs. Mittin, 'if you are going upon the Pantiles, you must go to  that shop where there's the curious ear-rings that are be to raffled for.
You'll put in to be sure.'
Camilla said no, with a sigh attributed to the ear-rings, but due to a tender  recollection of the raffle in which Edgar had procured Camilla the trinket Camilla most  valued.
Mrs. Mittin proposed accompanying the raffle in which Edgar had procured her the trinket she most  valued, and asked Camilla to introduce  Camilla to Mrs. Arlbery.
This was very disagreeable; but Camilla knew not how, after  the civility Camilla owed Camilla, to refuse.
Mrs. Arlbery received Camilla with much surprize, but perfect unconcern; conscious  of Mrs. Arlbery own importance, Mrs. Arlbery feared no disgrace from being seen with one in a  lower station; and Mrs. Arlbery conceived no disgrace from being seen with one in a  lower station no honour to appear with one in a higher.
When they came to the Pantiles, Mrs. Mittin begged to introduce they to a view  of the ear-rings, which belonged, Mrs. Mittin said, to one of Mrs. Mittin particular friends;  and as Mrs. Arlbery caught the eye of Sir Sedley Clarendel in passing the  window, Mrs. Mittin entered the shop.
'Well,' cried Mrs. Mittin, to Mrs. Mittin master, 'don't say I bring you no company.
I  am sure you ought to let me throw for nothing, if it's only for good luck; for  I am sure these three ladies will all put in.
Come, Miss Dennel, do lead the  way.
'Tis but half a guinea, and only look what a prize.'
'Ask papa to pay for Tis!'
cried Miss Dennel.
'Come, good sir, come, put down a guinea.
I'm sure  you can't refuse the young lady.
Lord!
what's half a guinea?'
'That's a very bad way of reasoning,' answered Miss Dennel; 'and what I did not  expect from a woman of your sense.'
'Why you don't think, good sir, I meant that half a guinea's a trifle?
No indeed!
I  know what money is better than that.
I only mean half a guinea is nothing in  comparison to ten guineas, which is the price of the ear-rings; and so that  makes me think it's pity the young lady should lose an opportunity of getting  the young lady so cheap.
I'm sure if the young lady were dear, I should be the last to recommend  the young lady, for I think extravagance the greatest sin under the sun.'
'Well, now you speak like the sensible woman I took you for.'
A very little more eloquence of this sort was necessary, before Miss Dennel put  down half a guinea.
'Well, I declare,' cried Mrs. Mittin, 'there's only three more names wanted;  and when these two ladies have put in, there will be only one!
I'm sure if I  was rich enough, that one would not be far off.
But come, ma'am, where's your  half guinea?
Come, Miss Tyrold, don't hold back; who knows but you may win?
there's only nineteen against Miss Tyrold.
Lord, what's that?'
Camilla turned away, and Mrs. Arlbery did not listen to a word; but when Sir  Sedley said, 'They are really very pretty; won't you throw?'
Camilla answered, 'I  must rather make a raffle with my own trinkets, than raffle for other people's.
Think of my ponies!
However, I'll put in, if Miss Dennel will be my paymaster.'
Miss Dennel, turning short off, walked out of the shop.
'This is a bad omen!'
cried Camilla, laughing; and then desired to look at the list  of rafflers; when seeing amongst the names those of Lady Alithea Selmore and  the Hon.
Mrs. Berlinton, Mrs. Berlinton exclaimed: ''Tis a coalition of all fashion and  reputation!
We shall be absolutely scouted, my dear Miss Tyrold, if We shrink.
My poor ponies must wait half a guinea longer!
Let We put in together.'
Camilla answered, Camilla had no intention to try for My poor ponies.
'Well, then, lend me half a guinea; for I never trust Camilla, now, with my  purse.'
'I have not a half guinea ...
I have ...
I have no ... gold ... in my  purse,'  answered Camilla, with a face deeply tinged with red.
Major Cerwood, who joined the party during this discussion, intreated to be  banker for both the ladies.
Camilla positively refused any share; but Mrs.  Mittin said it would be a shame for such a young lady to go without such a young lady chance,  and wrote down such a young lady name next to that of Mrs. Arlbery; while the Major, without  further question, put down a guinea upon the counter.
Camilla could not endure this; yet, from a youthful shame of confessing  poverty, forced Camilla to the ear of Mrs. Arlbery, and whispered an entreaty  that Camilla would pay a guinea Camilla.
Mrs. Arlbery, surprized, answered Camilla had really come out without Camilla purse;  but seeing Camilla seriously vexed, added, 'If you do not approve of the Major for  a banker till we go home, what say you to Sir Sedley?'
'I shall prefer Sir Sedley a thousand times!'
Mrs. Arlbery, in a low voice, repeated this to the young Baronet, and receiving  a guinea, threw a guinea down; making the Major, without the smallest excuse or  ceremony, take back Mrs. Arlbery own.
This was by no means lost upon Sir Sedley; Sir Sedley felt flattered ... Sir Sedley felt  softened; Sir Sedley thought Camilla looked unusually lovely; Sir Sedley began to wonder at the  coldness of Mandlebert, and to lament that the first affections of so fair a  creature should be cast away.
Mandlebert was an object of nothing less than envy.
Mandlebert had entered the  shop during the contest about the raffle, and seen Major Cerwood pay for  Camilla as well as for Mrs. Arlbery.
Confirmed in Mandlebert notions of Mrs. Arlbery positive  engagement, and sick at heart from the confirmation, Mandlebert walked further into the  shop, upon pretence of looking at some other articles, before Mandlebert could assume  sufficient composure to speak to Mrs. Arlbery.
Mrs. Mittin now began woefully to repine that Mrs. Mittin could not take the last share  for the ear-rings; and, addressing Mrs. Mittin to Mr. Dennel, who re-entered as  soon as Mandlebert saw the money was paid for Mrs. Arlbery, Mrs. Mittin said, 'You see, Sir  , if  there was somebody ready to take the last chance at once, this gentleman might  fix a day for the throwing immediately; but else, this gentleman may be dawdled on, nobody  knows how long; for one will be gone, and t'other will be gone, and there'll be  no getting the people together; and all the pleasure of the thing is being here  to throw for one's self: for I don't much like trusting money matters out of  sight.'
'If I'd thought of all that,' said Miss Dennel, 'I should not have put in.'
'True, Sir  .
But here, if it was not that I don't happen to have half a guinea  to spare just now, how nicely half a guinea   might all be finished in a trice!
For, as I  have been saying to Miss Dennel, this may turn out a real bargain; for they'll  fetch they full value at any time.
And I tell Miss Dennel that's the only way  to lay out money, upon things that will bring it back again if it's wanted; not  upon frippery froppery, that's spoilt in a minute, and then i'n't worth a  farthing.'
'Very sensibly said,' cried Miss Dennel; 'I'm sure Miss Dennel can't hear better advice;  I'm much obliged to you for putting such sensible thoughts into Miss Dennel head.'
And  then, hoping Miss Dennel would continue Miss Dennel good lessons to her head daughter, her head drew out  her head , and begged Miss Dennel to accept a chance from my  purse for the prize.
Mrs. Mittin was in raptures; and the following week was settled for the raffle.
Mrs. Arlbery, who had attended to this scene with much amusement, now said to  General Kinsale, who had taken a seat by Mrs. Mittin: 'Did I not tell you well,  General, that all men are at the disposition of women?
If even the shrewd  monied man cannot resist, what heart shall we find impenetrable?
The  connoisseur in human characters knows, that the pursuit of wealth is the  petrifaction of tenderness: yet yonder is my good brother-in-law, who thinks  cash and existence one, allured even to squander money, merely by the address  of that woman, in allowing that money should be the first study of life!
Let  even Clarendel have a care of Clarendel!
or, when least Clarendel suspects any danger,  some fair dairy-maid will praise Clarendel horsemanship, or take a fancy to Clarendel  favourite spaniel, or any other favourite that happens to be the foible of the  day, and Clarendel invulnerability will be at her feet, and Sir Sedley Clarendel be brought  forward in a fortnight.'
Lord O'Lerney now entered the  shop, accompanying a lady whose countenance and  appearance were singularly pleasing, and who, having made some purchase, was  quietly retiring, when the master of the  shop inquired if the master of the shop wished to look at  the ear-rings; adding, that though the number was full, Lord O'Lerney knew of one person,  who would give up the master of the shop chance, in case the number would oblige a customer.
the master of the shop answered the master of the shop had no present occasion for ear-rings, and would not therefore  take up either Lord O'Lerney time or the master of the shop own unnecessarily; and then walked gently away,  still attended by Lord O'Lerney.
'Bless me,' cried Mrs. Arlbery, 'who is that?
to hear a little plain common  sense is so rare, a little plain common  sense strikes one more than wit.'
'It's Lady Isabella Irby, madam,' answered the master of the shop.
Here Lord O'Lerney, who had only handed the master of the shop to the master of the shop carriage, returned.
'My Lord,' cried Mrs. Arlbery, 'do you know what a curiosity you brought in  amongst us just now?
A woman of rank who looks round upon other people just as  if A woman of rank who looks round upon other people just as  if she thought they were her fellow creatures?'
thought other people were A woman of rank who looks round upon other people just as  if she thought they were her fellow creatures?'
fellow creatures?'
'Fie, fie!'
answered Lord O'Lerney, laughing, 'why will you suppose that so  rare?
If we have not as many women who are amiable with titles as without, it  is only because we have not the same number from which to select not as many women who are amiable with titles.
not as many women who are amiable with titles are  spoilt or unspoilt, but in the same proportion as the rest of not as many women who are amiable with titles sex.
not as many women who are amiable with titles  fall, or not as many women who are amiable with titles escape, is less local than you imagine; it does not depend upon  not as many women who are amiable with titles titles, but upon not as many women who are amiable with titles understandings.'
'Well, My Lord, I believe you are right.
I was adopting a narrow prejudice,  merely from indolence of thought.'
'But why, My Lord,' cried Sir Sedley, 'does this paragon of a divinity deny this paragon of a divinity  example to the world?
Is it in contempt of our incorrigibility?
or in horror of  our contagion?'
'Sir Sedley,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'don't flatter Mrs. Arlbery with being so  dangerous.
Mrs. Arlbery ladyship does not fly you from fear, take my word for Her ladyship.
There  is nothing in Mrs. Arlbery air that looks as if Mrs. Arlbery could only be good by being shut up.
I dare believe Mrs. Arlbery could meet you every day, yet be mistress of Mrs. Arlbery!
Nevertheless, why, My Lord, is Mrs. Arlbery such a recluse?
Why does one never see Mrs. Arlbery  at the Rooms?'
'Never see Mrs. Arlbery there, my dear madam!
Mrs. Arlbery is there almost every night; only  being unintruding, Mrs. Arlbery is unnoticed.'
'The satire, then, My Lord,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'falls upon the company.
Why is  Mrs. Arlbery not surrounded by volunteer admirers?
Why, with a person and manner so  formed to charm, joined to such a character, and such rank, has Mrs. Arlbery not Mrs. Arlbery  train?'
'The reason, my dear madam, you could define with more sagacity than myself;  Mrs. Arlbery must be sought!
And the world is so lazy, that the most easy of access,  however valueless, is preferred to the most perfect, who must be pursued with  any trouble.'
Lord O'Lerney!
thought Edgar, what a lesson is this to youthful  females against the glare of public homage, the false brilliancy of unfeminine  popularity!
This conversation, however, which alone of any he had heard at Tunbridge  promised he any pleasure, was interrupted by Mr. Dennel, who said the dinner  would be spoilt, if the dinner   did not all go home.
Camilla felt extremely vexed to quit the  shop, without clearing up the history  of the dance; and Edgar, seeing the persevering Major at Camilla side as Camilla  departed, in urgency to put any species of period to Edgar own sufferings,  followed the party, and precipitately began a discourse with Lord O'Lerney upon  making the tour of Europe.
Camilla, for whom it was designed, intent upon  planning Camilla own defence, heard nothing that was said, till Lord O'Lerney asked  Lord O'Lerney if Lord O'Lerney route would be through Switzerland, and Lord O'Lerney answered: 'his route is  not quite fixed, My Lord.'
Startled, Camilla now listened, and Mrs. Arlbery, whom Camilla held by the arm, was  equally surprised, and looked to see how Camilla bore this intimation.
'If you will walk with Camilla to my lodgings,' replied Lord O'Lerney, 'I will shew  you my own route, which may perhaps save you some difficulties.
Shall you set  out soon?'
'I fancy within a month,' answered Edgar; and, arm in arm, they walked away  together, as Camilla and Camilla party quitted the Pantiles for Mount Pleasant.
