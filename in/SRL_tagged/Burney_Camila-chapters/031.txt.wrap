 A Few Embarrassments  Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold returned to Etherington somewhat relieved in their spirits,  though perplexed in their opinions. They had heard from Sir Hugh, that Edgar  had decidedly disavowed any pretensions to Indiana, and had voluntarily  retreated from Cleves, that his disavowal might risk no misconstruction, either  in the family or the neighbourhood.  This insensibility to beauty the most exquisite wanted no advocate with Mrs.  Tyrold. Once more she conceived some hope of what she wished, and she  determined upon seeing Edgar before her departure. The displeasure she had  nourished against him vanished, and justice to his general worth, with an  affection nearly maternal to his person, took again their wonted place in her  bosom, and made her deem herself unkind in having purposed to quit the kingdom  without bidding him farewell.  Mr. Tyrold, whom professional duty and native inclination alike made a man of  peace, was ever happy to second all conciliatory measures, and the first to  propose them, where his voice had any chance of being heard. He sent a note,  therefore, to invite Edgar to call the next morning; and Mrs. Tyrold deferred  her hour of setting off till noon.  Her own natural and immediate impulse, had been to carry Camilla with her  abroad; but when she considered that her sole errand was to nurse and appease  an offended sick man, whose chamber she meant not to quit till she returned to  her family, she gave up the pleasure she would herself have found in the  scheme, to her fears for the health and spirits of her darling child, joined to  the superior joy of leaving such a solace with her husband.  Sir Hugh had heard the petition for postponing the further visit of Camilla  almost with despondence; but Mr. Tyrold restored him completely to confidence,  with respect to his doubts concerning Dr. Orkborne, with whom he held a long  and satisfactory conversation; and his own benevolent heart received a sensible  pleasure, when, upon examining Indiana with regard to Edgar, he found her,  though piqued and pouting, untouched either in affection or happiness.  Early the next morning Edgar came. Mrs. Tyrold had taken measures for employing  Camilla upstairs, where she did not even hear that he entered the house.  He was received with kindness, and told of the sudden journey, though not of  its motives. He heard of it with unfeigned concern, and earnestly solicited to  be the companion of the voyage, if no better male protector were appointed.  Mr. Tyrold folded his arms around him at this grateful proposal, while his  wife, animated off her guard, warmly exclaimed—'My dear, excellent Edgar! you  are indeed the model, the true son of your guardian!'  Sorry for what had escaped her, from her internal reference to Lionel, she  looked anxiously to see if he comprehended her; but the mantling blood which  mounted quick into his cheeks, while his eyes sought the ground, soon told her  there was another mode of affinity, which at that moment had struck him.  Willing to establish whether this idea were right, she now considered how she  might name Camilla; but her husband, who for no possible purpose could witness  distress without seeking to alleviate it, declined his kind offer, and began a  discourse upon the passage to Lisbon.  This gave Edgar time to recover, and, in a few seconds, something of moment  seemed abruptly to occur to him, and scarcely saying adieu, he hurried to  remount his horse.  Mrs. Tyrold was perplexed; but she could take not steps towards an explanation,  without infringing the delicacy she felt due to her daughter: she suffered him,  therefore, to depart.  She then proceeded with her preparations, which entirely occupied her till the  chaise was at the gate; when, as the little party, their eyes and their hearts  all full, were taking a last farewell, the parlour door was hastily opened, and  Dr. Marchmont and Edgar entered the room.  All were surprised, but none so much as Camilla, who, forgetting, in sudden  emotion, every thing but former kindness and intimacy, delightedly  exclaimed—'Edgar! O how happy, my dearest mother!—I was afraid you would go  without seeing him!'  Edgar turned to her with a quickness that could only be exceeded by his  pleasure; her voice, her manner, her unlooked-for interest in his appearance,  penetrated to his very soul. 'Is it possible,' he cried, 'you could have the  goodness to wish me this gratification? At a moment such as this, could  you——?' think of me, he would have added; but Dr. Marchmont, coming  forward, begged him to account for their intrusion.  Almost overpowered by his own sudden emotion, he could scarce recollect its  motive himself; while Camilla, fearful and repentant that she had broken her  deliberate and well-principled resolutions, retreated to the window.  Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold witnessed the involuntary movements which betrayed their  mutual regard with the tenderest satisfaction; and the complacency of their  attention, when Edgar advanced to them, soon removed his embarrassment.  He then briefly acquainted them, that finding Mrs. Tyrold would not accept him  for her chevalier, he had ridden hard to the parsonage of Cleves, whence he  hoped he had brought her one too unexceptionable for rejection.  Dr. Marchmont, with great warmth, then made a proffer of his services,  declaring he had long desired an opportunity to visit Portugal; and protesting  that, besides the pleasure of complying with any wish of Mr. Mandlebert's, it  would give him the most serious happiness to shew his gratitude for the many  kind offices he owed to Mr. Tyrold, and his high personal respect for his lady;  he should require but one day for his preparations, and for securing the  performance of the church duty at Cleves during his absence.  Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold were equally struck by the goodness of Dr. Marchmont, and  the attentive kindness of Edgar. Mrs. Tyrold, nevertheless, would immediately  have declined the scheme; but her husband interposed. Her travelling, he said,  with such a guard, would be as conducive to his peace at home, as to her safety  abroad. 'And with respect,' cried he, 'to obligation, I hold it as much a moral  duty not to refuse receiving good offices, as not to avoid administering them.  That species of independence, which proudly flies all ties of gratitude, is  inimical to the social compact of civilized life, which subsists but by  reciprocity of services.'  Mrs. Tyrold now opposed the scheme no longer, and the chaise was ordered for  the next day.  Dr. Marchmont hurried home to settle his affairs; but Edgar begged a short  conference with Mr. Tyrold.  Every maternal hope was now awake in Mrs. Tyrold, who concluded this request  was to demand Camilla in marriage; and her husband himself, not without  trepidation, took Edgar into his study.  But Edgar, though his heart was again wholly Camilla's, had received a look  from Dr. Marchmont that guarded him from any immediate declaration. He simply  opened upon the late misconception at Cleves; vindicated himself from any  versatility of conduct, and affirmed, that both his attentions and his regard  for Indiana had never been either more or less than they still continued. All  this was spoken with a plainness to which the integrity of his character gave a  weight superior to any protestations.  'My dear Edgar,' said Mr. Tyrold, 'I am convinced of your probity. The tenor of  your life is its guarantee, and any other defence is a degradation. There is,  indeed, no perfidy so unjustifiable, as that which wins but to desert the  affections of an innocent female. It is still, if possible, more cowardly than  it is cruel; for the greater her worth, and the more exquisite her feelings,  the stronger will be the impulse of her delicacy to suffer uncomplaining; and  the deluder of her esteem commonly confides, for averting her reproach, to the  very sensibility through which he has ensnared her good opinion.'  'No one,' said Edgar, 'can more sincerely concur in this sentiment than myself;  and, I trust, there is no situation, and no character, that could prompt me to  deviate in this point. Here, in particular, my understanding must have been as  defective as my morals, to have betrayed me into such an enterprise.'  'How do you mean?'  'I beg pardon, my dear sir; but, though I have a sort of family regard for Miss  Lynmere, and though I think her beauty is transcendent, her heart, I  believe——' he hesitated.  'Do you think her heart invulnerable?'—  'Why—no—not positively, perhaps,' answered he, embarrassed, 'not positively  invulnerable; but certainly I do not think it composed of those finely subtle  sensations which elude all vigilance, and become imperceptibly the prey of  every assailing sympathy; for itself, therefore, I believe it not in much  danger; and, for others—I see not in it that magnetic attraction which charms  away all caution, beguiles all security, enwraps the imagination, and masters  the reason!—--'  The chain of thinking which, from painting what he thought insensible in  Indiana, led him to describe what he felt to be resistless in Camilla, made him  finish the last sentence with an energy that surprised Mr. Tyrold into a smile.  'You seem deeply,' he said, 'to have studied the subject.'  'But not under the guidance of Miss Lynmere,' he answered, rising, and  colouring, the moment he had spoken, in the fear he had betrayed himself.  'I rejoice, then, the more,' replied Mr. Tyrold, calmly, 'in her own slackness  of susceptibility.'  'Yes,' cried Edgar, recovering, and quietly re-placing himself; 'it is her own  security, and it is the security of all who surround her; though to those,  indeed, there was also another, a still greater, in the contrast which——'  he stopt, confused at his own meaning; yet presently, almost irresistibly,  added—'Not that I think the utmost vivacity of sentiment, nor all the charm  of soul, though eternally beaming in the eyes, playing in every feature,  glowing in the complection, and brightening every smile——' he stopt again,  overpowered with the consciousness of the picture he was portraying; but Mr.  Tyrold continuing silent, he was obliged, though he scarce knew what he said,  to go on. 'Nothing, in short, so selfishly are we formed,—that nothing, not  even the loveliest of the lovely, can be truly bewitching, in which we do not  hope or expect some participation.—I believe I have not made myself very  clear?—However, it is not material—I simply meant to explain my retreat  from Cleves. And, indeed, it is barbarous, at a season such as this, to detain  you a moment from your family.'  He then hastily took leave.  Mr. Tyrold was sensibly touched by this scene. He saw, through a discourse so  perplexed, and a manner so confused, that his daughter had made a forcible  impression upon the heart of Mandlebert, but could not comprehend why he seemed  struggling to conceal it. What had dropt from him appeared to imply a distrust  of exciting mutual regard; yet this, after his own observations upon Camilla,  was inconceivable. He regretted, that at a period so critical, she must part  with her mother, with whom again he now determined to consult.  Edgar, who hitherto had opened his whole heart upon every occasion to Mr.  Tyrold, felt hurt and distressed at this first withholding of confidence. It  was, however, unavoidable, in his present situation.  He went back to the parlour to take leave once more of Mrs. Tyrold; but,  opening the door, found Camilla there alone. She was looking out of the window,  and had not heard his entrance.  This was not a sight to still his perturbed spirits; on the contrary, the  moment seemed to him so favourable, that it irresistibly occurred to him to  seize it for removing every doubt.  Camilla, who had not even missed her mother and sister from the room, was  contemplating the horse of Edgar, and internally arraigning herself for the  dangerous pleasure she had felt and manifested at the sight of his master.  He gently shut the door, and approaching her, said, 'Do I see again the same  frank and amiable friend, who in earliest days, who always, indeed, till—'  Camilla, turning round, startled to behold him so near, and that no one else  remained in the room, blushed excessively, and without hearing what he said,  shut the window; yet opened it the same minute, stammering out something, but  she herself knew not what, concerning the weather.  The gentlest thoughts crossed the mind of Edgar at this evident embarrassment,  and the most generous alacrity prompted him to hasten his purpose. He drew a  chair near her, and, in penetrating accents, said: 'Will you suffer me, will  you, can you permit me, to take the privilege of our long friendship, and  honestly to speak to you upon what has passed within these last few days at  Cleves?'  She could not answer: surprise, doubt, fear of self-deception, and hope of some  happy explanation, all suddenly conspired to confound and to silence her.  'You cannot, I think, forget,' he soon resumed, 'that you had condescended to  put into my hands the management and decision of the new acquaintance you are  anxious to form? My memory, at least, will never be unfaithful to a testimony  so grateful to me, of your entire reliance upon the deep, the unspeakable  interest I have ever taken, and ever must take, in my invaluable guardian, and  in every branch of his respected and beloved family.'  Camilla now began to breathe. This last expression, though zealous in  friendliness, had nothing of appropriate partiality; and in losing her hope she  resumed her calmness.  Edgar observed, though he understood not, the change; but as he wished to  satisfy his mind before he indulged his inclination, he endeavoured not to be  sorry to see her mistress of herself during the discussion. He wished her but  to answer him with openness: she still, however, only listened, while she rose  and looked about the room for some work. Edgar, somewhat disconcerted, waited  for her again sitting down; and after a few minutes spent in a useless search,  she drew a chair to a table at some distance.  Gravely then following, he stood opposite to her, and, after a little pause,  said, 'I perceive you think I go too far? you think that the intimacy of  childhood, and the attachment of adolescence, should expire with the juvenile  sports and intercourse which nourished them, rather than ripen into solid  friendship and permanent confidence?'  'Do not say so,' cried she, with emotion; 'believe me, unless you knew all that  had passed, and all my motives, you should judge nothing of these last few  days, but think of me only, whether well or ill, as you thought of me a week  ago.'  The most laboured and explicit defence could not more immediately have  satisfied his mind than this speech. Suspicion vanished, trust and admiration  took its place, and once more drawing a chair by her side, 'My dear Miss  Camilla,' he cried, 'forgive my having thus harped upon this subject; I here  promise you I will name it no more.'  'And I,' cried she, delighted, 'promise you'—she was going to add, that she  would give up Mrs. Arlbery, if he found reason to disapprove the acquaintance;  but the parlour door opened, and Miss Margland stalked into the room.  Sir Hugh was going to send a messenger to enquire how and when Mrs. Tyrold had  set out; but Miss Margland, from various motives of curiosity, offered her  services, and came herself. So totally, however, had both Edgar and Camilla  been engrossed by each other, that they had not heard the carriage drive up to  the garden gate, which, with the door of the house, being always open, required  neither knocker nor bell.  A spectre could not more have startled or shocked Camilla. She jumped up, with  an exclamation nearly amounting to a scream, and involuntarily seated herself  at the other end of the room.  Edgar, though not equally embarrassed, was still more provoked; but he rose,  and got her a chair, and enquired after the health of Sir Hugh.  'He is very poorly, indeed,' answered she, with an austere air, 'and no wonder!'  'Is my uncle ill?' cried Camilla, alarmed.  Miss Margland deigned no reply.  The rest of the family, who had seen the carriage from the windows, now entered  the room, and during the mutual enquiries and account which followed, Edgar,  believing himself unobserved, glided round to Camilla, and in a low voice,  said, 'The promise—I think I guess its gratifying import—I shall not, I  hope, lose, through this cruel intrusion?'  Camilla, who saw no eyes but those of Miss Margland, which were severely  fastened upon her, affected not to hear him, and planted herself in the group  out of his way.  He anxiously waited for another opportunity to put in his claim; but he waited  in vain; Camilla, who from the entrance of Miss Margland had had the depressing  feel of self-accusation, sedulously avoided him; and though he loitered till he  was ashamed of remaining in the house at a period so busy, Miss Margland, by  indications not to be mistaken, shewed herself bent upon out-staying him; he  was obliged, therefore, to depart; though, no sooner was he gone, than, having  nothing more to scrutinize, she went also.  But little doubt now remained with the watchful parents of the mutual  attachment of Edgar and Camilla, to which the only apparent obstacle seemed, a  diffidence on the part of Edgar with respect to her internal sympathy. Pleased  with the modesty of such a fear in so accomplished a young man, Mr. Tyrold  protested that, if the superior fortune were on the side of Camilla, he would  himself clear it up, and point out the mistake. His wife gloried in the  virtuous delicacy of her daughter, that so properly, till it was called for,  concealed her tenderness from the object who so deservingly inspired it; yet  they agreed, that though she could not, at present, meet Edgar too often, she  should be kept wholly ignorant of their wishes and expectations, lest they  should still be crushed by any unforeseen casualty: and that, meanwhile, she  should be allowed every safe and innocent recreation, that might lighten her  mind from its depression, and restore her spirits to their native vivacity.  Early the next morning Dr. Marchmont came to Etherington, and brought with him  Lionel, by the express direction of his father, who never objected to admit the  faulty to his presence; his hopes of doing good were more potent from kindness  than from severity, from example than from precept: yet he attempted not to  conquer the averseness of Mrs. Tyrold to an interview; he knew it proceeded not  from an inexorable nature, but from a repugnance insurmountable to the sight of  a beloved object in disgrace.  Mrs. Tyrold quitted her husband with the most cruel regret, and her darling  Camilla with the tenderest inquietude; she affectionately embraced the  unexceptionable Lavinia, with whom she left a message for her brother, which  she strictly charged her to deliver, without softening or omitting one word.  And then, attended by Dr. Marchmont, she set forward on her journey towards  Falmouth: whence a packet, in a few days, she was informed, would sail for  Lisbon.
