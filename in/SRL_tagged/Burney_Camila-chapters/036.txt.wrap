 A Few Explanations  The last words of Dr. Marchmont, in taking leave of Edgar, were injunctions to  circumspection, and representations of the difficulty of drawing back with  honour, if once any incautious eagerness betrayed his partiality. To this  counsel he was impelled to submit, lest he should risk for Camilla a report  similar to that which for Indiana had given him so much disturbance. There,  indeed, he felt himself wholly blameless. His admiration was but such as he  always experienced at sight of a beautiful picture, nor had it ever been  demonstrated in any more serious manner. He had distinguished her by no  particular attention, singled her out by no pointed address, taken no pains to  engage her good opinion, and manifested no flattering pleasure at her approach  or presence.  His sense of right was too just to mislead him into giving himself similar  absolution with respect to Camilla. He had never, indeed, indulged a voluntary  vent to his preference; but the candour of his character convinced him that  what so forcibly he had felt, he must occasionally have betrayed. Yet the idea  excited regret without remorse; for though it had been his wish, as well as  intention, to conceal his best hopes, till they were ratified by his judgment,  he had the conscious integrity of knowing that, should her heart become his  prize, his dearest view in life would be to solicit her hand.  To preserve, therefore, the appearance of an undesigning friend of the house,  he had forced himself to refrain, for two days, from any visit to the rectory,  whither he was repairing, when thus, unlooked and unwished for, he surprized  Camilla at the Grove.  Disappointed and disapproving feelings kept him, while there, aloof from her;  by continual suggestions, that her character was of no stability, that Dr.  Marchmont was right in his doubts, and Miss Margland herself not wrong in  accusing her of caprice; and when he perceived, upon her preparing to walk home  with her brother and sister, that Major Cerwood stept forward to attend her, he  indignantly resolved to arrange without delay his continental excursion. But  again, when, as she quitted the room, he saw her head half turned round, with  an eye of enquiry if he followed, he determined frankly, and at once, in his  capacity of a friend, to request some explanation of this meeting.  The assiduities of the Major made it difficult to speak to her; but the aid of  her desire for a conversation, which was equally anxious, and less guarded than  his own, anticipated his principal investigation, by urging her, voluntarily to  seize an opportunity of relating to him the history of her first visit to Mrs.  Arlbery; and of assuring him that the second was indispensably its consequence.  Softened by this apparent earnestness for his good opinion, all his interest  and all his tenderness for her returned; and though much chagrined at the  accident, or rather mischief, which had thus established the acquaintance, he  had too little to say, whatever he had to feel, of positive weight against it,  to propose its now being relinquished. He thanked her impressively for so ready  an explanation; and then gently added; 'I know your predilection in favour of  this lady, and I will say nothing to disturb it; but as she is yet new to you,  and as all residence, all intercourse, from your own home or relations, is new  to you also—tell me, candidly, sincerely tell me, can you condescend to  suffer an old friend, though in the person of but a young man, to offer you,  from time to time, a hint, a little counsel, a few brief words of occasional  advice? and even, perhaps, now and then, to torment you into a little serious  reflection?'  'If you,' cried she, gaily, 'will give me the reflection, I promise, to the  best of my power, to give you in return, the seriousness; but I can by no means  engage for both!'  'O, never, but from your own prudence,' he answered, gratefully, 'may your  delightful vivacity know a curb! If now I seem myself to fear it, it is not  from moroseness, it is not from insensibility to its charm——'  He was stopt here by Macdersey, who, suddenly overtaking him, entreated an  immediate short conference upon a matter of moment.  Though cruelly vexed by the interruption, he could not refuse to turn back with  him; and Camilla again was left wholly to the gallant Major; but her heart felt  so light that she had thus cleared herself to Edgar, so gratified by his  request to become himself her monitor, and so enchanted to find her  acquaintance with Mrs. Arlbery no longer disputed, that she was too happy to  admit any vexation; and the Major had never thought her so charming, though of  the Major she thought not one moment.  Macdersey, with a long, ceremonious, and not very clear apology, confessed he  had called Mandlebert aside only to enquire into the certain truth, if it were  not a positive secret, of his intended nuptials with the beautiful Miss  Lynmere. Mandlebert, with surprize, but without any hesitation, declared  himself wholly without any pretensions to that lady. Macdersey then embraced  him, and they parted mutually satisfied.  It seemed now too late to Mandlebert to go to Etherington till the next day,  whither, as soon as he had breakfasted, he then rode.  According to his general custom, he went immediately to the study, where he met  with a calm, but kind reception from Mr. Tyrold; and after half an hour's  conversation, upon Lisbon, Dr. Marchmont, and Mrs. Tyrold, he left him to seek  his young friends.  In the parlour, he found Lavinia alone; but before he could enquire for her  sister, who was accidentally up stairs, Lionel, just dismounted from his horse,  appeared.  'O, ho, Edgar!' cried he, 'you are here, are you? this would make fine  confusion, if that beauty of nature, Miss Margland, should happen to call.  They've just sent for you to Beech Park. I don't know what's to be done to you;  but if you have an inclination to save poor Camilla's eyes, or cap, at least,  from that meek, tender creature, you'll set off for Cleves before they know you  are in this house.'  Edgar amazed, desired an explanation; but he protested the wrath of Miss  Margland had been so comical, and given him so much diversion, that he had not  been able to get at any particulars; he only knew there was a great commotion,  and that Edgar was declared in love with some of his sisters or cousins, and  Miss Margland was in a rage that it was not with herself; and that, in short,  because he only happened to drop a hint of the latter notion, that delectable  paragon had given him so violent a blow with her fine eyes, that in order to  vent an ungovernable fit of laughter, without the risk of having the house  pulled about his ears, he had hastily mounted his horse, and galloped off.  The contempt of Edgar for Miss Margland would have made him disdain another  question, if the name of Camilla had not been mingled in this relation; no  question, however, could procure further information. Lionel, enchanted that he  had tormented Miss Margland, understood nothing more of the matter, and could  only repeat his own merry sayings, and their effect.  Lavinia expressed, most innocently, her curiosity to know what this meant; and  was going for Camilla, to assist in some conjecture; but Edgar, who by this  strange story had lost his composure, felt unequal to hearing it discussed in  her presence, and, pleading sudden haste, rode away.  He did not, however, go to Cleves; he hardly knew if Lionel had not amused him  with a feigned story; but he no sooner arrived at Beech Park, then he found a  message from Sir Hugh, begging to see him with all speed.  The young Ensign was the cause of this present summons and disturbance. Elated  by the declaration of Mandlebert, that the rumour of his contract was void of  foundation, and buoyed up by Mrs. Arlbery, to whom he returned with the  communication, he resolved to make his advances in form. He presented himself,  therefore, at Cleves, where he asked an audience of Sir Hugh, and at once, with  his accustomed vehemence, declared himself bound eternally, life and soul, to  his fair niece, Miss Lynmere; and desired that, in order to pay his addresses  to her, he might be permitted to see her at odd times, when he was off duty.  Sir Hugh was scarce able to understand him, from his volubility, and the  extravagance of his phrases and gestures; but he imputed them to his violent  passion, and therefore answered him with great gentleness, assuring him he did  not mean to doubt his being a proper alliance for his niece, though he had  never heard of him before; but begging he would not be affronted if he could  not accept him, not knowing yet quite clearly if she were not engaged to a  young gentleman in the neighbourhood.  The Ensign now loudly proclaimed his own news: Mandlebert had protested himself  free, and the whole county already rang with the mistake.  Sir Hugh, who always at a loss how to say no, thought this would have been a  good answer, now sent for Miss Margland, and desired her to speak herself with  the young gentleman.  Miss Margland, much gratified, asked Macdersey if she could look at his rent  roll.  He had nothing of the kind at hand, he said, not being yet come to his estate,  which was in Ireland, and was still the property of a first cousin, who was not  yet dead.  Miss Margland, promising he should have an answer in a few days, then dismissed  him; but more irritated than ever against Mandlebert, from the contrast of his  power to make settlements, she burst forth into her old declarations of his ill  usage of Miss Lynmere; attributing it wholly to the contrivances of Camilla,  whom she had herself, she said, surprized wheedling Edgar into her snares, when  she called last at Etherington; and who, she doubted not, they should soon hear  was going to be married to him.  Sir Hugh always understood literally whatever was said; these assertions  therefore of ill humour, merely made to vent black bile, affected him deeply  for the honour and welfare of Camilla, and he hastily sent a messenger for  Edgar, determining to beg, if that were the case, he would openly own the  whole, and not leave all the blame to fall all upon his poor niece.  At this period, Lionel had called, and, by inflaming Miss Margland, had  aggravated the general disturbance.  When Edgar arrived, Sir Hugh told him of the affair, assuring him he should  never have taken amiss his preferring Camilla, which he thought but natural, if  he had only done it from the first.  Edgar, though easily through all this he saw the malignant yet shallow offices  of Miss Margland, found himself, with infinite vexation, compelled to declare  off equally from both the charges; conscious, that till the very moment of his  proposals, he must appear to have no preference nor designs. He spoke,  therefore, with the utmost respect of the young ladies, but again said it was  uncertain if he should not travel before he formed any establishment.  The business thus explicitly decided, nothing more could be done: but Miss  Margland was somewhat appeased, when she heard that her pupil was not so  disgracefully to be supplanted.  Indiana herself, to whom Edgar had never seemed agreeable, soon forgot she had  ever thought of him; and elated by the acquisition of a new lover, doubted not,  but, in a short time, the publication of her liberty would prove slavery to all  mankind.  Early the next morning, the carriage of Sir Hugh arrived at the rectory for  Camilla. She never refused an invitation from her uncle, but she felt so little  equal to passing a whole day in the presence of Miss Margland, after the  unaccountable, yet alarming relation she had gathered from Lionel, that she  entreated him to accompany her, and to manage that she should return with him  as soon as the horses were fed and rested.  Lionel, ever good humoured, and ready to oblige, willingly complied; but  demanded that she should go with him, in their way back, to see a new house  which he wanted to examine.  Sir Hugh received her with his usual affection, Indiana with indifference, and  Miss Margland with a malicious smile: but Eugenia, soon taking her aside,  disclosed to her that Edgar, the day before, had publicly and openly disclaimed  any views upon Indiana, and had declared himself without any passion whatever,  and free from all inclination or intention but to travel.  The blush of pleasure, with which Camilla heard the first sentence of this  speech, became the tingle of shame at the second, and whitened into surprise  and sorrow at the last.  Eugenia, though she saw some disturbance, understood not these changes. Early  absorbed in the study of literature and languages, under the direction of a  preceptor who had never mingled with the world, her capacity had been occupied  in constant work for her memory; but her judgment and penetration had been  wholly unexercised. Like her uncle, she concluded every body, and every thing  to be precisely what they appeared; and though, in that given point of view,  she had keener intellects to discern, and more skill to appreciate persons and  characters, she was as unpractised as himself in those discriminative powers,  which dive into their own conceptions to discover the latent springs, the  multifarious and contradictory sources of human actions and propensities.  Upon their return to the company, Miss Margland chose to relate the history  herself. Mr. Mandlebert, she said, had not only thought proper to acknowledge  his utter insensibility to Miss Lynmere, but had declared his indifference for  every woman under the sun, and protested he held them all cheap alike. 'So I  would advise nobody,' she continued, 'to flatter themselves with making a  conquest of him, for they may take my word for it, he won't be caught very  easily.'  Camilla disdained to understand this but in a general sense, and made no  answer. Indiana, pouting her lip, said she was sure she did not want to catch  him: she did not fear having offers enough without him, if she should happen to  chuse to marry.  'Certainly,' said Miss Margland, 'there's no doubt of that; and this young  officer's coming the very moment he heard of your being at liberty, is a proof  that the only reason of your having had no more proposals, is owing to Mr.  Mandlebert. So I don't speak for you, but for any body else, that may suppose  they may please the difficult gentleman better.'  Camilla now breathed hard with resentment; but still was silent, and Indiana,  answering only for herself, said: 'O, yes! I can't say I'm much frightened. I  dare say if Mr. Melmond had known, ... but he thought like everybody else ...  however, I'm sure, I'm very glad of it, only I wish he had spoke a little  sooner, for I suppose Mr. Melmond thinks me as much out of his reach as if I  was married. Not that I care about it; only it's provoking.'  'No, my dear,' said Miss Margland, 'it would be quite below your dignity to  think about him, without knowing better who he is, or what are his expectations  and connexions. As to this young officer, I shall take proper care to make  enquiries, before he has his answer. He belongs to a very good family; for he's  related to Lord O'Lerney, and I have friends in Ireland who can acquaint me  with his situation and fortune. There's time enough to look about you; only as  Mr. Mandlebert has behaved so unhandsomely, I hope none of the family will give  him their countenance. I am sure it will be to no purpose, if any body should  think of doing it by way of having any design upon him. It will be lost labour,  I can tell them.'  'As to that, I am quite easy,' said Indiana, tossing her head, 'any body is  welcome to him for me;—my cousin, or any body else.'  Camilla, now, absolutely called upon to speak, with all the spirit she could  assume, said, 'With regard to me, there is no occasion to remind me how much I  am out of the question; yet suffer me to say, respect for myself would secure  me from forming such plans as you surmise, if no other sense of propriety could  save me from such humiliation.'  'Now, my dear, you speak properly,' said Miss Margland, taking her hand; 'and I  hope you will have the spirit to shew him you care no more for him than he  cares for you.'  'I hope so too,' answered Camilla, turning pale; 'but I don't suppose—I can't  imagine—that it is very likely he should have mentioned anything good or  bad—with regard to his care for me?'  This was painfully uttered, but from a curiosity irrepressible.  'As to that, my dear, don't deceive yourself; for the question was put home to  him very properly, that you might know what you had to expect, and not keep off  other engagements from a false notion.'  'This indeed,' said Camilla, colouring with indignation, 'this has been a most  useless, a most causeless enquiry!'  'I am very glad you treat the matter as it deserves, for I like to see young  ladies behave with dignity.'  'And pray, then, what—was there any—did he make—was there any—any  answer—to this—to—.'  'O, yes, he answered without any great ceremony, I can assure you! He said, in  so many words, that he thought no more of you than of our cousin, and was going  abroad to divert and amuse himself, better than by entering into marriage, with  either one or other of you; or with any body else.'  Camilla felt half killed by this answer; and presently quitting the room, ran  out into the garden, and to a walk far from the house, before she had power to  breathe, or recollection to be aware of the sensibility she was betraying.  She then as hastily went back, secretly resolving never more to think of him,  and to shew both to himself and to the world, by every means in her power, her  perfect indifference.  She could not, however, endure to encounter Miss Margland again, but called for  Lionel, and begged him to hurry the coachman.  Lionel complied—she took a hasty leave of her uncle, and only saying, 'Good  by, good by!' to the rest, made her escape.  Sir Hugh, ever unsuspicious, thought her merely afraid to detain her brother;  but Eugenia, calm, affectionate, and divested of cares for herself, saw  evidently that something was wrong, though she divined not what, and entreated  leave to go with her sister to Etherington, and thence return, without keeping  out the horses.  Sir Hugh was well pleased, and the two sisters and Lionel set off together.
