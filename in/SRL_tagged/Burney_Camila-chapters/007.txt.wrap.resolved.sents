 Lost Labour  From this period, the families of Etherington and Cleves lived in the enjoyment  of uninterrupted harmony and repose, till Eugenia, the most juvenile of the  set, had attained her fifteenth year.
Sir Hugh then wrote to Leipsic, desiring Sir Hugh nephew Lynmere to return home  without delay.
'Not that I intend,' Sir Hugh said to Mr. Tyrold, 'marrying them  together at this young age, Eugenia being but a child, except in point of  Latin; though I assure you, my dear brother, she's the most sensible of the  whole, poor Indiana being nothing to she, for all she prettiness; but the thing  is, the sooner Clermont comes over, the sooner the sooner Clermont may begin forming the  proper regard.'
The knowledge of this projected alliance was by no means confined to Sir Hugh  and Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold; it was known throughout the family, though never  publicly announced, and understood from she childhood by Eugenia herself,  though Mr. Tyrold had exerted Mr. Tyrold utmost authority to prevent Sir Hugh from  apprizing Mr. Tyrold of it in form.
It was nevertheless, the joy of his heart to  prepare the young people for each other: and his scheme received every  encouragement his could desire, from the zeal and uncommon progress in she  studies made by Eugenia; which most happily corresponded with all his  injunctions to Leipsic, for the application and acquirements of Clermont.
Thus circumstanced, it was a blow to his the most unexpected, to receive from  the young bridegroom elect, in answer to his summons home, a petition to make  the tour of Europe, while yet on the continent.
'What!'
cried Sir Hugh, 'and is this all Sir Hugh care for us?
after so many years  separation from Sir Hugh kin and kind, has Sir Hugh no natural longings to see Sir Hugh native  land?
no yearnings to know Sir Hugh own relations from strangers?'
Eugenia, notwithstanding Eugenia extreme youth, secretly applauded and admired a  search of knowledge Eugenia would gladly have participated [in]; though Eugenia was not  incurious to see the youth Eugenia considered as Eugenia destined partner for life, and  to whom all Eugenia literary labours had been directed: for the never-failing  method of Sir Hugh to stimulate Eugenia if Eugenia was idle, had been to assure Eugenia  that, unless Eugenia worked harder, Eugenia cousin Clermont would eclipse Eugenia.
Eugenia had now acquired a decided taste for study, which, however unusual for Eugenia  age, most fortunately rescued from weariness or sadness the sedentary life,  which a weak state of health compelled Eugenia to lead.
This induced Eugenia to look  with pleasure upon Clermont as the object of Eugenia emulation, and to prosecute  every plan for Eugenia improvement, with that vigour which accompanies a pursuit of  our own choice; the only labour that asks no relaxation.
Steady occupations, such as these, kept off all attention to Eugenia personal  misfortunes, which Sir Hugh had strictly ordered should never be alluded to;  first, Sir Hugh said, for fear fear should vex Eugenia; and next, lest fear should make  Eugenia hate Sir Hugh, for being fear cause.
Those incidents, therefore, from never  being named, glided imperceptibly from Eugenia thoughts; and Eugenia grew up as  unconscious as Eugenia was innocent, that, though born with a beauty which  surpassed that of Eugenia lovely sisters, disease and accident had robbed Eugenia of  that charm ere Eugenia knew Eugenia possessed it.
But neither disease nor accident had  power over Eugenia mind; there, in neither disease nor accident purest proportions, moral beauty preserved  neither disease nor accident first energy.
The equanimity of Eugenia temper made Eugenia seem, though a female,  born to be a practical philosopher; Eugenia abilities and Eugenia sentiments were each  of the highest class, uniting the best adorned intellects with the best  principled virtues.
The dissatisfaction of Sir Hugh with Sir Hugh nephew reached not to prohibition: his nephew  consent was painful, but his nephew remittances were generous, and Clermont had three  years allowed his nephew for his nephew travels through Europe.
Yet this permission was no sooner granted than the baronet again became  dejected.
Three years appeared to the baronet to be endless: the baronet could hardly persuade  the baronet to look forward to them with expectation of life; and all the learned  labours the baronet had promoted seemed vain and unpromising, ill requiting the baronet toils,  and still less answering the baronet hopes.
Even the studious turn of Eugenia, hitherto  the baronet first delight, the baronet now thought served but to render her unsociable; and the  time her devoted to study, the baronet began to regret as lost to the baronet; nor could the baronet  suggest any possible consolation for the baronet drooping spirits, till it occurred to  the baronet that Camilla might again enliven the baronet.
This idea, and the order for his carriage, were the birth of the same moment;  and, upon entering the study of Mr. Tyrold, the baronet abruptly exclaimed, 'My dear  brother, I must have Camilla back!
Indiana says nothing to amuse me; and  Eugenia is so bookish, I might as well live with an old woman; which God forbid  I should object to, only I like Camilla better.'
This request was by no means welcome to Mr. Tyrold, and utterly distasteful to  Mr. Tyrold lady.
Camilla was now just seventeen years of age, and attractively lovely;  but of a character that called for more attention to its developement than to  its formation; though of a disposition so engaging, that affection kept pace  with watchfulness, and Camilla fond parents knew as little for her fond parents own sakes as  for Camilla's how to part with Camilla.
Camilla qualities had a power which, without consciousness how, or consideration  why, governed Camilla whole family.
The airy thoughtlessness of Camilla nature was a  source of perpetual amusement; and, if sometimes Camilla vivacity raised a fear for  Camilla discretion, the innocence of Camilla mind reassured sometimes her vivacity raised a fear for  her discretion after every alarm.
The  interest which Camilla excited served to render Camilla the first object of the house;  it was just short of solicitude, yet kept it constantly alive.
Camilla spirits were  volatile, but Camilla heart was tender; Camilla gaiety had a fascination; Camilla  persuasion was irresistible.
To give Camilla now up to Sir Hugh, seemed to Mrs. Tyrold rather impossible than  disagreeable; but Sir Hugh was too urgent with Sir Hugh brother to be wholly refused.
Mrs. Tyrold  was granted Sir Hugh, therefore, as a guest, for the three ensuing months, to aid  Sir Hugh to dissipate Sir Hugh immediate disappointment, from the procrastinated absence  of Clermont.
Sir Hugh received back Sir Hugh first favourite with all the fond glee of a ductile  imagination, which in every new good sees a refuge from every past or present  evil.
But, as the extremest distaste of all literature now succeeded those  sanguine views which had lately made it Sir Hugh exclusive object, the first words  Sir Hugh spoke upon her arrival were, to inform her her must learn no Latin; and the  first step which followed her welcome, was a solemn charge to Dr. Orkborne,  that Sir Hugh must give her no lessons.
The gaiety, the spirit, the playful good humour of Camilla, had lost nothing of  The gaiety, the spirit, the playful good humour of Camilla charm by added years, though her understanding had been sedulously  cultivated, and her principles modelled by the pure and practical tenets of her  exemplary parents.
The delight of Sir Hugh in regaining her, consisted not  merely of the renovation of Sir Hugh first prejudice in her favour; it was  strengthened by the restoration it afforded Sir Hugh own mind to it natural state,  and the relief of being disburthened of a task Sir Hugh was so ill calculated to  undertake, as superintending, in any sort, intellectual pursuits.
