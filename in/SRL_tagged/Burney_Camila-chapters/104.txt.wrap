 The Workings of Sorrow  The visit of the Westwyns to Sir Hugh shewed Lavinia in so favourable a light,  that nothing less than the strong prepossession already conceived for Camilla  could have guarded the heart of the son, or the wishes of the father, from the  complete captivation of her modest beauty, her intrinsic worth, and the  cheerful alacrity, and virtuous self-denial, with which she presided in the new  œconomy of the rectory. But though the utter demolition of hope played with  Henry its usual part of demolishing, also, half the fervour of admiration, he  still felt, in consequence of his late failure, a distaste of any similar  attempt: and Mr. Westwyn, unbribed by the high praise of his son, which had won  him in Camilla, left him master of his choice. Each, however, found a delight  in the Tyrold society, that seconded the wishes of the Baronet to make them  lengthen their visit.  The retrenchments, by which the debts of Clermont were to be paid, could no  longer, nevertheless, be deferred; and Mr. Tyrold was just setting out for  Cleves, to give his counsel for their arrangement, when his daughters were  broken in upon by Mrs. Mittin.  Camilla could scarcely look at her, for displeasure at her conduct; but soon  observed she seemed herself full of resentment and ill humour. She desired a  private interview; and Camilla then found, that Mrs. Arlbery had not only  represented her fault, and frightened her with its consequences, but  occasioned, though most undesignedly, new disturbances and new dangers to  herself: for Mrs. Mittin at length learnt, in this conference, with equal  certainty, surprise, and provocation, that the inheritance of Sir Hugh was  positively and entirely settled upon his youngest niece; and that the denials  of all expectation on the part of Camilla, which she had always taken for  closeness, conveyed but the simple truth. Alarmed lest she should incur the  anger of Mr. Clykes, who was amongst her most useful friends, she had written  him word of the discovery, with her concern at the mistake: and Mr. Clykes,  judging now he had no chance of the gratuity finally promised for honour and  secrecy, and even that his principal was in danger, had sent an enraged answer,  with an imperious declaration, that he must either immediately be repaid all he  had laid out, or receive some security for its being refunded, of higher value  than the note of a minor of no fortune nor expectations.  Mrs. Mittin protested she did not know which way to turn, she was so sorry to  have disobliged so good a friend; and broke forth into a vehement invective  against Mr. Dubster, for pretending he knew the truth from young Squire Tyrold  himself.  Long as was her lamentation, and satisfied as she always felt to hear her own  voice, her pause still came too soon for any reply from Camilla, who now felt  the discovery of her situation to be inevitable, compulsatory and disgraceful.  Self-upbraidings that she had ever listened to such an expedient, assailed her  with the cruellest poignancy, mingling almost self-detestation with utter  despair.  In vain Mrs. Mittin pressed for some satisfaction; she was mute from inability  to devise any; till the coachman of Mr. Lissin sent word he could wait no  longer. She then, in a broken voice, said, 'Be so good as to write to Mr.  Clykes, that if he will have the patience to wait a few days, I will prepare my  friends to settle my accounts with him.'  Mrs. Mittin then, recovering from her own fright in this business, answered,  'O, if that's the case, my dear young lady, pray don't be uneasy, for it  grieves me to vex you; and I'll promise you I'll coax my good friend to wait  such a matter as that; for he's a vast regard for me; he'll do any thing I ask  him, I know.'  She now went away; and Lavinia, who ran to her sister, found her in a state of  distress, that melted her gentle heart to behold: but when she gathered what  had passed, 'This disclosure, my dearest Camilla,' she cried, 'can never be so  tremendous as the incessant fear of its discovery. Think of that, I conjure  you! and endeavour to bear the one great shock, that will lead to after peace  and ease.'  'No, my dear sister, peace and ease are no more for me!—My happiness was  already buried;—and now, all that remained of consolation will be cut off  also, in the lost good opinion of my father and mother!—that destroyed—and  Edgar gone—what is life to me?—I barely exist!'  'And is it possible you can even a moment doubt their forgiveness? dear as you  are to them, cherished, beloved!—'  'No—not their forgiveness—but their esteem, their confidence, their  pleasure in their daughter will all end!—think, Lavinia, of my mother!—when  she finds I, too, have contributed to the distress and disturbance of my  father—that on my account, too, his small income is again straitened, his few  gratifications are diminished—O Lavinia! how has she strove to guard her poor  tottering girl from evil! And how has her fondness been always the pride of my  life! What a conclusion is this to her cares! what a reward to all the goodness  of my father!'  In this state of desperate wretchedness, she was still incapable to make the  avowal which was now become indispensable, and which must require another loan  from the store her father held so sacred. Lavinia had even less courage; and  they determined to apply to Eugenia, who, though as softly feeling as either,  mingled in her character a sort of heroic philosophy, that enabled her to  execute and to endure the hardest tasks, where she thought them the demand of  virtue. They resolved, therefore, the next morning, to send a note to Cleves  for the carriage, and to commit the affair to this inexperienced and youthful  female sage.  Far from running, as she was wont, to meet her father upon his entrance,  Camilla was twice sent for before she could gain strength to appear in his  presence; nor could his utmost kindness enable her to look up.  The heart of Mr. Tyrold was penetrated by her avoidance, and yet more sunk by  her sight. His best hopes were all defeated of affording her parental comfort,  and he was still to seek for her revival or support.  He related what had passed at Cleves, with the accustomed openness with which  he conversed with his children as his friends. Clermont, he said, was arrived,  and had authenticated all the accounts, with so little of either shame or  sense, that a character less determined upon indulgence than that of Sir Hugh,  must have revolted from affording him succour, if merely to mortify him into  repentance. The manner of making payment, however, had been the difficult  discussion of the whole day. Sir Hugh was unequal to performing any thing,  though ready to consent to every thing. When he proposed the sale of several of  his numerous horses, he objected, that what remained would be hard worked: when  he mentioned diminishing his table, he was afraid the poor would take it ill,  as they were used to have his orts: and when he talked of discharging some of  his servants, he was sure they would think it very unkind. 'His heart,'  continued Mr. Tyrold, 'is so bountiful, and so full of kindness, that he pleads  his tender feelings, and regretting wishes, against the sound reason of hard  necessity. What is right, however, must only in itself seek what is pleasant;  and there, when it ceases to look more abroad, it is sure to find it.'  He stopt, hearing a deep sigh from Camilla, who secretly ejaculated a prayer  that this sentence might live, henceforward, in her memory. He divined the  wish, which devoutly he echoed, and continued:  'There is so little, in fine, that he could bear to relinquish, that, with my  utmost efforts, I could not calculate any retrenchment, to which he will agree,  at more than an hundred a year. Yet his scruples concerning his vow resist all  the entreaties of our disinterested Eugenia, to either sell out for the sum, or  cut down any trees in Yorkshire. These difficulties, too potent for his weak  frame, were again sinking him into that despondence which we should all  sedulously guard against, as the most prevailing of foes to active virtue,  when, to relieve him, I made a proposal which my dear girls will both, I trust,  find peculiar pleasure in seconding.'  Camilla had already [attempted] to raise her drooping head, conscience struck  at what was said of despondence; and now endeavoured to join in the cheerful  confidence expressed by Lavinia, that he could not be mistaken.  'The little hoard, into which already we have broken for Lionel,' he went on,  'I have offered to lend him for present payment, as far as it will go, and to  receive it again at stated periods. In the mean while, I shall accept from him  the same interest as from the bank. For this I am to have also security. I run  no risk of the little all I have to leave to my two girls.'  He now looked at them both, expecting to see pleasure even in Camilla, that  what was destined, hereafter, for herself, could prove of the smallest utility  to Sir Hugh; but his disappointment, and her shock were equal. Too true for the  most transitory disguise, the keenest anguish shot from her eye; and Mr.  Tyrold, amazed, said: 'Is it Camilla who would draw back from any service to  her uncle?'  'Ah no!' cried she, with clasped hands, 'I would die to do him any good! and  O!—that my death at this moment——'  She stopt, affrighted, for Mr. Tyrold frowned. A frown upon a face so  constantly benign, was new, was awful to her; but she instantly recollected his  condemnation of wishes so desperate, and fearfully taking his hand, besought  his forgiveness.  His brow instantly resumed its serenity. 'I have nothing,' said he, 'my dearest  child, to forgive, from the moment you recollect yourself. But try, for your  own sake, to keep in mind, that the current sorrows, however acute, of current  life, are but uselessly aggravated by vain wishes for death. The smallest kind  office better proves affection than any words, however elevated.'  The conference here broke up; something incomprehensible seemed to Mr. Tyrold  to be blended with the grief of Camilla; and though from her birth she had  manifested, by every opportunity, the most liberal disregard of wealth, the  something not to be understood seemed always to have money for its object. What  this might be, he now fervently wished to explore; yet still hoped, by patient  kindness, to receive her confidence voluntarily.  Camilla now was half dead; Lavinia could with difficulty sustain, but by no  possible means revive her. What a period was this to disclose to her Father  that she must deprive him, in part, even of his promised solace in his intended  assistance to his brother, to satisfy debts of which he suspected not the  existence!  When forced down stairs, by a summons to supper, Mr. Tyrold, to console her for  his momentary displeasure, redoubled his caresses; but his tenderness only made  her weep yet more bitterly, and he looked at her with a heart rent with  anguish. For Lavinia, for Eugenia, he would have felt similar grief; but their  far less gay, though equally innocent natures, would have made the view of  their affliction less strikingly oppressive. Camilla had, hitherto, seemed in  the spring of joy yet more than of life. Anxiety flew at her approach, and  animation took its place. Nothing could shake his resignation; yet to behold  her constant sadness, severely tried his fortitude. To see tears trickling  incessantly down the pale cheeks so lately blooming; to see her youthful  countenance wear the haggard expression of care; to see life, in its wish and  purposes seem at an end, 'ere, in its ordinary calculation, it was reckoned to  have begun, drew him from every other consideration, and filled his whole mind  with monopolizing apprehension.  He now himself pressed her, for change of scene, to accept an invitation she  had received from Mrs. Berlinton to Grosvenor Square, whither Indiana was going  in a few days, to spend a fortnight or three weeks before her marriage. But she  declined the excursion, as not more unseasonable in its expence, than ungenial  to her feelings.  The following morning, while they were at their melancholy breakfast, a letter  arrived from Lisbon, which Mr. Tyrold read with visible disturbance,  exclaiming, from time to time, 'Lionel, thou art indeed punished!'  The sisters were equally alarmed, but Lavinia alone could make any enquiry.  Mr. Tyrold then informed them, their uncle Relvil had just acknowledged to  their Mother, that he could no longer, in justice, conceal that, previously to  his quitting England, he had privately married his house-keeper, to induce her  to accompany him in his voyage: and that, during his first wrath upon the  detection of Lionel, he had disinherited him in favour of a little boy of her  own, by a former marriage, whom they had brought with them to Lisbon.  Mr. Tyrold, though it had been his constant study to bring up his children  without any reference to their rich uncles, had never internally doubted, but  that the bachelor brother of Mrs. Tyrold would leave his fortune to the son of  his only sister, who was his sole near relation. And Lionel, he knew, in  defiance of his admonitions, had built upon it himself, rather as a certainty  than a hope. 'He will now see,' said Mr. Tyrold, 'his presumption, and feel, by  what he suffers, what he has earned. Yet culpable as he has been, he is now,  also, unfortunate; and where crimes are followed by punishment, it is not for  mortal man to harbour unabating resentment. I will write a few lines of comfort  to him.'  Camilla, in this concession, experienced all she could feel of satisfaction;  but the short sensation died away at the last words of the letter of her  Mother, which Mr. Tyrold read aloud.  'You, I well know, will immediately in this evil, find for yourself, and impart  to our children, something of instruction, if not of comfort. Shall I recollect  this without emulation? No, I will bear up from this stroke, which, at least,  permits my return to Etherington; where, in the bosom of my dear family, and  supported by its honoured chief, I will forget my voyage, my painful absence,  and my disappointment, in exertions of practical œconomy, strict, but not  rigid, which our good children will vie with each other to adopt: sedulous, all  around, to shew in what we can most forbear. I hope almost immediately to claim  my share in these labours, which such motives will make light, and such  companions render precious.'  In agony past repression at these words, Camilla glided out of the room. The  return of her Mother was now horrour to her, not joy; her shattered nerves  could not bear the interview, while under a cloud threatening to burst in such  a storm; and she entreated Lavinia to tell her Father that she accepted his  proposal for going to Mrs. Berlinton's; 'and there,' she cried, 'Lavinia, I  will wait, till Eugenia has told the dreadful history that thus humbles me to  the dust!'  Lavinia was too timid to oppose reason to this suffering; and Mr. Tyrold,  already cruelly apprehensive the obscurity of their recluse lives contributed  to her depression, and believing she compared her present privations to the  lost elegancies of Beech Park, sighed heavily, yet said he was glad she would  remove from a spot in which reminiscence was so painful. This was not, indeed,  he added, the period he should have selected for her visiting the capital, or  residing at Mrs. Berlinton's; but she was too much touched by the state of her  family, not to be guarded in her expences; and the pressure of her even  augmenting sadness, was heavier upon his mind than any other alarm.  The conscience-struck Camilla could make no profession, no promise; nor yet,  though ardently wishing it, refuse his offered advance of her next quarter's  allowance, lest she should be reduced again to the necessity of borrowing.  This step once decided, brought with it something like a gloomy composure. 'I  shall avoid,' she cried, 'at least, with my Mother, these killing caresses of  deluded kindness that break my heart with my Father. She, too, would soon  discover there was something darker in my sadness than even grief! She would be  sure that even my exquisite loss could not render me ungrateful to all  condolement; she would know that a daughter whom she had herself reared and  instructed, would blush so unceasingly to publish any personal disappointment,  let her feel it how she might. O my loved Mother! how did the delight of  knowing your kind expectations keep me, while under your guidance in the way I  ought to go! O Mother of my heart! what a grievous disappointment awaits your  sad return! To find, at the first opening of your virtuous schemes of general  saving—that I, as well as Lionel, have involved my family in debts—that I,  as well as Clermont, have committed them clandestinely to a usurer!'  Lavinia undertook to give Eugenia proper instructions for her commission; but  news arrived, the next day, that Sir Hugh would take no denial to Eugenia's  being herself of the party. This added not, however, to the courage of Camilla  for staying, and her next determination was to reveal the whole by letter.  Mr. Tyrold would not send her to Cleves to take leave, that her uncle might not  be tempted to exercise his wonted, but now no longer convenient generosity, nor  yet be exposed to the pain of withholding it. 'You will go, now, my dear girl,'  he said, 'in your pristine simplicity, and what can so every way become you? It  is not for a scheme of pleasure, but for a stimulus to mental exertion, I part  with you. When you return, your excellent Mother will aid your task, and reward  its labour. Remember but, while in your own hands, that open œconomy,  springing from discretion, is always respected. It is false shame alone that  begets ridicule.'  Weeping and silent she heard him, and his fears gained ground that her  disappointment, joined to a view of gayer life, had robbed Etherington of all  charms to her. Bitterly he regretted he had ever suffered her to leave his  roof, though he would not now force her stay. Compulsion could only detain her  person; and might heighten the disgust of her mind.  The little time which remained was given wholly to packing and preparing; and  continued employment hid from Mr. Tyrold her emotion, which encreased every  moment, till the carriage of Sir Hugh stopt at the gate. Lost, then, to all  sensation, but the horrour of the avowal that must intervene 'ere they met  again, with incertitude if again he would see her with the same kindness, she  flew into his arms, rather agonised than affectionate; kissed his hands with  fervour, kissed every separate finger, rested upon his shoulder, hid her face  in his bosom, caught and pressed to her lips even the flaps of his coat, and  scarce restrained herself from bending to kiss his feet; yet without uttering a  word, without even shedding a tear.  Strangely surprised, and deeply affected, Mr. Tyrold, straining her to his  breast, said: 'Why, my dear child, why, my dearest Camilla, if thus agitated by  our parting, do you leave me?'  This question brought her to recollection, by the impossibility she found to  answer it; she tore herself, therefore, away from him, embraced Lavinia, and  hurried into the coach.  BOOK X
