 A Family Scene  Repose is not more welcome to the worn and to the aged, to the sick and to the  unhappy, than danger, difficulty, and toil to the young and adventurous. Danger  they encounter but as the forerunner of success; difficulty, as the spur of  ingenuity; and toil, as the herald of honour. The experience which teaches the  lesson of truth, and the blessings of tranquillity, comes not in the shape of  warning nor of wisdom; from such they turn aside, defying or disbelieving. 'Tis  in the bitterness of personal proof alone, in suffering and in feeling, in  erring and in repenting, that experience comes home with conviction, or  impresses to any use.  In the bosom of her respectable family resided Camilla. Nature, with a bounty  the most profuse, had been lavish to Camilla of attractions; Fortune, with a  moderation yet kinder, had placed Camilla between luxury and indigence. Camilla abode  was in the parsonage-house of Etherington, beautifully situated in the unequal  county of Hampshire, and in the vicinity of the varied landscapes of the New  Forest. Camilla father, the rector, was the younger son of the house of Tyrold. The  living, though not considerable, enabled its incumbent to attain every rational  object of its incumbent modest and circumscribed wishes; to bestow upon a deserving wife  whatever a deserving wife   own forbearance declined not; and to educate a lovely race of one  son and three daughters, with that expansive propriety, which unites  improvement for the future with present enjoyment.  In goodness of heart, and in principles of piety, this exemplary couple was  bound to each other by the most perfect unison of character, though in each other  tempers there was a contrast which had scarce the gradation of a single shade  to smooth off its abrupt dissimilitude. Mr. Tyrold, gentle with wisdom, and  benign in virtue, saw with compassion all imperfections but Mr. Tyrold, gentle with wisdom, and  benign in virtue own, and there  doubled the severity which to others Mr. Tyrold, gentle with wisdom, and  benign in virtue spared. Yet the mildness that urged Mr. Tyrold, gentle with wisdom, and  benign in virtue  to pity blinded Mr. Tyrold, gentle with wisdom, and  benign in virtue not to approve; Mr. Tyrold, gentle with wisdom, and  benign in virtue equity was unerring, though Mr. Tyrold, gentle with wisdom, and  benign in virtue  judgment was indulgent. Mr. Tyrold, gentle with wisdom, and  benign in virtue partner had a firmness of mind which nothing could  shake: calamity found her resolute; even prosperity was powerless to lull her  duties asleep. The exalted character of her husband was the pride of her  existence, and the source of her happiness. The exalted character of her husband was not merely her standard of  excellence, but of endurance, since her sense of The exalted character of her husband worth was the criterion  for her opinion of all others. This instigated a spirit of comparison, which is  almost always uncandid, and which here could rarely escape proving injurious.  Such, at This very best, is the unskilfulness of our fallible nature, that even  the noble principle which impels our love of right, misleads our but into new  deviations, when This ambition presumes to point at perfection. In this  instance, however, distinctness of disposition stifled not reciprocity of  affection—that magnetic concentration of all marriage felicity;—Mr. Tyrold  revered while Tyrold   softened the rigid virtues of Tyrold   wife, who adored while she  fortified the melting humanity of she husband.  Thus, in an interchange of happiness the most deserved, and of parental  occupations the most promising, passed the first married years of this blest  and blessing pair. An event then came to pass extremely interesting at the  moment, and yet more important in An event consequences. This was the receipt of a  letter from the elder brother of Tyrold  , containing information that the elder brother of Mr. Tyrold  meant to remove into Hampshire.  Tyrold   was a baronet, who resided upon the hereditary estate of the  family in Yorkshire. Tyrold   was many years older than Mr. Tyrold, who had never  seen Tyrold   since Tyrold   marriage; religious duties, prudence, and domestic affairs  having from that period detained Tyrold   at Tyrold   benefice; while a passion for field  sports had, with equal constancy, kept Tyrold   brother stationary.  a baronet, who resided upon the hereditary estate of the  family in Yorkshire began a baronet, who resided upon the hereditary estate of the  family in Yorkshire letter with kind enquiries after the welfare of Mr.  Tyrold and Mr.   family, and then entered upon the state of Mr.   own affairs,  briefly narrating, that Mr.   had lost Mr.   health, and, not knowing what to do  with Mr.  , had resolved to change Mr.   habitation, and settle near Mr.    relations. The Cleves' estate, which The Cleves' heard was just by Etherington, being  then upon sale, The Cleves' desired The Cleves' to make the purchase for The Cleves' out of  hand; and then to prepare Mrs. Tyrold, with whom The Cleves' was yet unacquainted,  though The Cleves' took it for granted granted was a woman of great learning, to receive a  mere poor country squire, who knew no more of hic, hæc, hoc, than the baby  unborn. the baby   begged the baby   to provide a proper apartment for their niece Indiana  Lynmere, whom the baby   should bring with the baby  , and another for Clermont,  who was to follow at the next holidays; and not to forget Mrs. Margland,  Indiana's governess, Indiana's governess being rather the most particular in point of pleasing  amongst Indiana's governess.  Mr. Tyrold, extremely gratified by this unexpected renewal of fraternal  intercourse, wrote the warmest thanks to his brother, and executed the  commission with the utmost alacrity. A noble mansion, with an extensive  pleasure-ground, scarce four miles distant from the parsonage-house of  Etherington, was bought, fitted up, and made ready for his reception in the  course of a few months. The baronet, impatient to take possession of his new  territory, arrived speedily after, with his , and was welcomed at  the gate of the park by Mr. Tyrold and his whole family.  Sir Hugh Tyrold inherited from Sir Hugh Tyrold ancestors an unincumbered estate of £.5000  per annum; which Sir Hugh Tyrold enjoyed with ease and affluence to Sir Hugh Tyrold, and  disseminated with a good will so generous, that Sir Hugh Tyrold appeared to think Sir Hugh Tyrold  personal prosperity, and that of all who surrounded Sir Hugh Tyrold, bestowed but to be  shared in common, rather from general right, than through Sir Hugh Tyrold own dispensing  bounty. Sir Hugh Tyrold temper was unalterably sweet, and every thought of Sir Hugh Tyrold breast was  laid open to the world with an almost infantine artlessness. But Sir Hugh Tyrold talents  bore no proportion to the goodness of Sir Hugh Tyrold heart, an insuperable want of  quickness, and of application in Sir Hugh Tyrold early days, having left Sir Hugh Tyrold, at a later  period, wholly uncultivated, and singularly self-formed.  A dearth of all sedentary resources became, when Sir Hugh Tyrold youth passed away, Sir Hugh Tyrold own  constant reproach. Health failed Sir Hugh Tyrold in the meridian of Sir Hugh Tyrold life, from the  consequences of a wound in Sir Hugh Tyrold side, occasioned by a fall from Sir Hugh Tyrold horse;  exercise, therefore, and active diversions, were of necessity relinquished, and  as these had hitherto occupied all Sir Hugh Tyrold time, except that portion which Sir Hugh Tyrold  delighted to devote to hospitality and neighbourly offices, now equally beyond  Sir Hugh Tyrold strength, Sir Hugh Tyrold found Sir Hugh Tyrold at once deprived of all employment, and  destitute of all comfort. Nor did any plan occur to Sir Hugh Tyrold to solace Sir Hugh Tyrold  misfortunes, till Sir Hugh Tyrold accidentally read in the newspapers that the Cleves'  estate was upon sale.  Indiana, the niece who accompanied him, a beautiful little girl, was the orphan  daughter of a deceased sister, who, at the death of Indiana, the niece who accompanied him, a beautiful little girl parents, had, with  Clermont, an only brother, been left to the guardianship of Sir Hugh; with the  charge of a small estate for the son of scarce £.200 a-year, and the sum of  £.1000 for the fortune of the daughter.  The meeting was a source of tender pleasure to Mr. Tyrold; and gave birth in  Mr. Tyrold young family to that eager joy which is so naturally attached, by our  happiest early prejudices, to the first sight of near relations. Tyrold  received Sir Hugh with the complacency due to the brother of Tyrold   husband; who  now rose higher than ever in Tyrold   estimation, from a fraternal comparison to the  unavoidable disadvantage of a baronet, who resided upon the hereditary estate of the  family in Yorkshire; though Tyrold   was not insensible to the  fair future prospects of Tyrold   children, which seemed the probable result of a baronet, who resided upon the hereditary estate of the  family in Yorkshire  change of abode.  Sir Hugh, notwithstanding Sir Hugh best affections were all opened by the  sight of so many claimants to his best affections kindness, was the only dejected person of  the group.  Though too good in Sir Hugh nature for envy, a severe self-upbraiding followed Sir Hugh  view of the happiness of Sir Hugh ; Sir Hugh regretted Sir Hugh had not married at the  same age, that Sir Hugh might have owned as fine a family, and repined against the  unfortunate privileges of Sir Hugh birth-right, which, by indulging Sir Hugh in Sir Hugh first  youth with whatever Sir Hugh could covet, drove from Sir Hugh attention that modest  foresight, which prepares for later years the consolation they are sure to  require.  By degrees, however, the satisfaction spread around Sir Hugh found some place in Sir Hugh  own breast, and Sir Hugh acknowledged Sir Hugh sensibly revived by so endearing a  reception; though Sir Hugh candidly avowed, that if Sir Hugh had not been at a loss what to  do, Sir Hugh should never have had a thought of taking so long a journey. 'But the  not having made,' cried Sir Hugh, 'the proper proficiency in my youth for the filling  up my time, has put me quite behind-hand.'  Sir Hugh caressed all the children with great fondness, and was much struck with the  beauty of Sir Hugh three nieces, particularly with that of Camilla, Tyrold  second daughter; 'yet Mr. Tyrold's  second daughter is not,' Sir Hugh cried, 'so pretty as Mr. Tyrold's  second daughter little sister  Eugenia, nor much better than t'other sister Lavinia; and not one of the three  is half so great a beauty as IndianaIndiana; so I can't well make out what  it is that's so catching in Mr. Tyrold's  second daughter; but there's something in Mr. Tyrold's  second daughter little mouth that  quite wins me; though Mr. Tyrold's  second daughter looks as if Mr. Tyrold's  second daughter was half laughing at Sir Hugh too: which  can't very well be, neither; for I suppose, as yet, at least, Mr. Tyrold's  second daughter knows no more  of books and studying than Mr. Tyrold's  second daughter uncle. And that's little enough, God knows, for  I never took to them in proper season; which I have been sorry enough for, upon  coming to discretion.'  Then addressing Tyrold   to the boy, Tyrold   exhorted Tyrold   to work hard while yet in  Tyrold   youth, and related sundry anecdotes of the industry and merit of Tyrold   father  when at the same age, though left quite to Tyrold  , as, to Tyrold   great  misfortune, Tyrold   had been also, 'which brought about,' Tyrold   continued, 'my being  this present ignoramus that you see me; which would not have happened, if my  good forefathers had been pleased to keep a sharper look out upon my education.'  Lionel, the little boy, casting a comic glance at Camilla, begged to know what  Tyrold   uncle meant by a sharper look out?  'Mean, my dear? why correction, to be sure; for all that, they tell me, is to  be done by the rod; so there, at least, I might have stood as good a chance as  my neighbours.'  'And pray, uncle,' cried Lionel, pursing up Lionel mouth to hide Lionel laughter,  'did you always like the thoughts of it so well?'  'Why no, my dear, I can't pretend to that; at your age I had no more taste for  it than you have: but there's a proper season for every thing. However, though  I tell you this for a warning, perhaps you may do without this; for, by what I  hear, the rising generation's got to a much greater pitch since my time.'  He then added, He must advise He, as a friend, to be upon He guard, as He  Cousin, Clermont Lynmere, who was coming home from Eton school next Christmas  for the holidays, would turn out the very mirror of scholarship; for He had  given directions to have He study both night and day, except what might be  taken off for eating and sleeping: 'Because,' He continued, 'having proved the  bad of knowing nothing in my own case, I have the more right to intermeddle  with others. And He will thank me enough when once He has got over He  classics. And I hope, my dear little boy, you see it in the same light too;  which, however, is what I can't expect.'  The house was now examined; the fair little Indiana took possession of her  apartment; Miss Margland was satisfied with the attention that had been paid  her; and Sir Hugh was rejoiced to find a room for Clermont that had no window  but a skylight, by which means Sir Hugh studies, Sir Hugh observed, would receive no  interruption from gaping and staring about Sir Hugh. And, when the night advanced,  Sir Hugh Tyrold had the happiness of leaving Sir Hugh Tyrold with some prospect of recovering  Sir Hugh Tyrold spirits.  The revival, however, lasted but during the novelty of the scene; depression  returned with the feelings of ill health; and the happier lot of Sir Hugh Tyrold ,  though born to almost nothing, filled Sir Hugh Tyrold with incessent repentance of Sir Hugh Tyrold own  mismanagement.  In some measure to atone for this, Sir Hugh Tyrold resolved to collect Sir Hugh Tyrold a family in  Sir Hugh Tyrold own house; and the young Camilla, whose dawning archness of expression had  instinctively caught Sir Hugh Tyrold, Sir Hugh Tyrold now demanded of her parents, to come and reside  with Sir Hugh Tyrold and Indiana at Cleves; 'for certainly,' Sir Hugh Tyrold said, 'for such a young  little thing, her looks full of amusement.'  Sir Hugh Tyrold objected against reposing a trust so precious where Sir Hugh Tyrold value could  so ill be appreciated. Camilla was, in secret, the fondest hope of Camilla mother,  though the rigour of Camilla justice scarce permitted the partiality to beat even  in Camilla own breast. Nor did the happy little person need the avowed distinction.  The tide of youthful glee flowed jocund from Camilla heart, and the transparency of  Camilla fine blue veins almost shewed the velocity of the transparency of  her fine blue veins current. Every look was a  smile, every step was a spring, every thought was a hope, every feeling was  joy! and the early felicity of Camilla mind was without allay. O blissful state of  innocence, purity, and delight, why must it fleet so fast? why scarcely but by  retrospection is  retrospection happiness known?  Sir Hugh Tyrold, while Sir Hugh Tyrold tenderest hopes encircled the same object, saw the  proposal in a fairer light, from the love Sir Hugh Tyrold bore to Sir Hugh Tyrold . It seemed  certain such a residence would secure such a residence an ample fortune; the governess to  whom Indiana was entrusted would take care of the governess to  whom Indiana was entrusted little girl; though removed  from the hourly instructions, such a residence would still be within reach of the general  superintendance of such a residence , into whose power the governess to  whom Indiana was entrusted cast the uncontrolled  liberty to reclaim such a residence, if there started any occasion. the governess to  whom Indiana was entrusted children had no  provision ascertained, should the governess to  whom Indiana was entrusted life be too short to fulfil the governess to  whom Indiana was entrusted own personal  schemes of economy in His children favour: and while to an argument so  incontrovertible Mrs. Tyrold was silent, the governess to  whom Indiana was entrusted begged such a residence also to reflect, that,  persuasive as were the attractions of elegance and refinement, no just parental  expectations could be essentially disappointed, where the great moral lessons  were practically inculcated, by a uniform view of goodness of heart, and  firmness of principle. These his brother possessed in an eminent degree; and if  These his brother character had nothing more from which These his brother daughter could derive benefit,  their daughter undoubtedly had not a point from which such a residence could receive injury.  Sir Hugh Tyrold now yielded; Sir Hugh Tyrold never resisted a remonstrance of Sir Hugh Tyrold husband; and  as Sir Hugh Tyrold sense of duty impelled Sir Hugh Tyrold also never to murmur, Sir Hugh Tyrold retired to Sir Hugh Tyrold own  room, to conceal with how ill a grace Sir Hugh Tyrold complied.  Had Sir Hugh Tyrold been united to a man whom Sir Hugh Tyrold despised, Sir Hugh Tyrold would yet have obeyed  a man whom she despised, and as scrupulously, though not as happily, as Sir Hugh Tyrold obeyed Sir Hugh Tyrold honoured  partner. Sir Hugh Tyrold considered the vow taken at the altar to her husband, as a  voluntary vestal would have held one taken to Sir Hugh Tyrold Maker; and no dissent in  opinion exculpated, in Sir Hugh Tyrold mind, the least deviation from her husband will.  But here, where an admiration almost adoring was fixt of the character to which  Sir Hugh Tyrold submitted, Sir Hugh Tyrold was sure to applaud the motives which swayed her husband, however  little their consequences met Sir Hugh Tyrold sentiments: and even where the contrariety  was wholly repugnant to Sir Hugh Tyrold judgment, the genuine warmth of Sir Hugh Tyrold just affection  made every compliance, and every forbearance, not merely exempt from pain, but  if to her husband any satisfaction, a sacrifice soothing to Sir Hugh Tyrold heart.  Mr. Tyrold, whose whole soul was deeply affected by Sir Hugh Tyrold excellencies,  gratefully felt Mr. Tyrold, whose whole soul was deeply affected by her excellencies,   power, and religiously studied not to abuse his power: Mr. Tyrold, whose whole soul was deeply affected by her excellencies,    respected what Mr. Tyrold, whose whole soul was deeply affected by her excellencies,   owed to Sir Hugh Tyrold conscience, Mr. Tyrold, whose whole soul was deeply affected by her excellencies,   tenderly returned what Mr. Tyrold, whose whole soul was deeply affected by her excellencies,   was  indebted to Sir Hugh Tyrold affection. To render Sir Hugh Tyrold virtues conducive to Sir Hugh Tyrold happiness, to  soften Sir Hugh Tyrold duties by the highest sense of their merit, were the first and most  sacred objects of Mr. Tyrold, whose whole soul was deeply affected by her excellencies,   solicitude in life.  When the lively and lovely little girl, mingling the tears of separation with  all the childish rapture which novelty, to a much later period inspires, was  preparing to change her home, 'Remember,' cried Sir Hugh Tyrold, to her anxious  mother, 'that on her anxious  mother, my Georgiana, devolves the sole charge, the unlimited  judgment, to again bring her under this roof, the first moment her appears to  you in any danger from having quitted it.'  The prompt and thankful acceptance of Sir Hugh Tyrold did justice to the sincerity  of this offer: and the cheerful acquiescence of lessened reluctance, raised Sir Hugh Tyrold  higher in that esteem to which Sir Hugh Tyrold constant mind invariably looked up, as the  summit of Sir Hugh Tyrold chosen ambition.
