 A few Compliments  The two young ladies and Mr. Dubster, left thus together, and so situated that  separation without assistance was impossible, looked at one another for some  time in nearly equal dismay; and then Mr. Dubster, with much displeasure,  exclaimed—'Them young gentlemen are as full of mischief, as an egg's full of  meat! Who'd have thought of a person's going to do such a thing as this?—it's  mortal convenient, making me leave my workmen at this rate; for I dare say  they're come, or coming, by this time. I wish I'd tied the ladder to this here  rafter.'  The sisters, though equally provoked, thought it necessary to make some apology  for the wild behaviour of their brother.  'O, young ladies,' said he, formally waving his hand by way of a bow, 'I don't  in the least mean to blame you about it, for you're very welcome to stay as  long as it's agreeable; only I hope he'll come back by my dinner time; for a  cold beef-steak is one or other the worst morsel I know.'  He then kept an unremitting watch from one window to another, for some  passenger from whom he could claim aid; but, much as he had boasted of the  numbers perpetually in sight, he now dolorously confessed, that, sometimes, not  a soul came near the place for half a day together: 'And, as to my workmen,'  continued he, 'the deuce can't make 'em hear if once they begin their knocking  and hammering.'  And then, with a smirk at the idea, he added—'I'll tell you what; I'd best  give a good squall at once, and then if they are come, I may catch 'em; in the  proviso you won't mind it, young ladies.'  This scheme was put immediately into practice; but though the sisters were  obliged to stop their ears from his vociferation, it answered no purpose.  'Well, I'll bet you what you will,' cried he, 'they are all deaf: however, it's  as well as it is, for if they was to come, and see me hoisted up in this cage,  like, they'd only make a joke of it; and then they'd mind me no more than a pin  never again. It's surprising how them young gentlemen never think of nothing.  If he'd served me so when I was a 'prentice, he'd have paid pretty dear for his  frolic; master would have charged him half a day's work, as sure as a gun.'  Soon after, while looking out of the window, 'I do think,' he exclaimed, 'I see  somebody!—It shall go hard but what I'll make 'em come to us.'  He then shouted with great violence; but the person crossed a stile into a  field, without seeing or hearing him.  This provoked him very seriously; and turning to Camilla, rather indignantly,  he said—'Really, ma'am, I wish you'd tell your brother, I should take it as a  favour he'd never serve me o' this manner no more!'  She hoped, she said, he would in future be more considerate.  'It's a great hindrance to business, ma'am, such things; and it's a sheer love  of mischief, too, begging pardon, for it's of no manner of use to him, no more  than it is to us.'  He then desired, that if any body should pass by again, they might all squall  out at once; saying, it was odds, then, but they might be heard.  'Not that it's over agreeable, at the best,' added he; 'for if one was to stop  any poor person, and make 'em come round, and look for the ladder, one could  not be off giving them something: and as to any of the gentlefolks, one might  beg and pray as long as one would before they'd stir a step for one: and as to  any of one's acquaintance, if they was to go by, it's ten to one but they'd  only fall a laughing. People's generally ill-natured when they sees one in  jeopardy.'  Eugenia, already thoughtful and discomposed, now grew uneasy, lest her uncle  should be surprised at her long absence; this a little appeased Mr. Dubster,  who, with less resentment, said—'So I see, then, we're all in the same  quandary! However, don't mind it, young ladies; you can have no great matters  to do with your time, I take it; so it does not so much signify. But a man's  quite different. He looks like a fool, as one may say, poked up in such a place  as this, to be stared at by all comers and goers; only nobody happens to pass  by.'  His lamentations now were happily interrupted by the appearance of three women  and a boy, who, with baskets on their heads, were returning from the next  market town. With infinite satisfaction, he prepared to assail them, saying, he  should now have some chance to get a bit of dinner: and assuring the ladies,  that if they should like a little scrap for a relish, he should be very willing  to send 'em it by their footman; 'For it's a long while,' said he, 'young  ladies, to be fasting, that's the truth of it.'  The market women now approached, and were most clamourously hailed, before  their own loud discourse, and the singing and whistling of the boy, permitted  their hearing the appeal.  'Pray, will you be so kind,' said Mr. Dubster, when he had made them stop, 'as  to step round by the house, and see if you can see the workmen; and if you can,  tell 'em a young gentleman, as come here while they was at dinner, has taken  away the ladder, and left us stuck up here in the lurch.'  The women all laughed, and said it was a good merry trick; but were preparing  to follow his directions, when Mr. Dubster called after the boy, who loitered  behind, with an encouraging nod: 'If you'll bring the ladder with you upon your  shoulders, my lad, I'll give you a half-penny!'  The boy was well contented; but the women, a little alarmed, turned back and  said—'And what will you give to us, master?' 'Give?' repeated he, a little  embarrassed; 'why, I'll give—why I'll thank you kindly; and it won't be much  out of your way, for the house is only round there.'  'You'll thank us kindly, will you?' said one of the women; it's like you may!  But what will you do over and above?'  'Do? why it's no great matter, just to stop at the house as you go by, and tell  'em——'  Here Eugenia whispered she would herself satisfy them, and begged he would let  them make their own terms.  'No, Miss, no; I don't like to see nobody's money fooled away, no more than my  own. However, as you are so generous, I'll agree with 'em to give 'em a pot of  beer.'  He then, with some parade, made this concession; but said, he must see the  ladder, before the money should be laid down.  'A pot of beer for four!—a pot of beer for four!' they all exclaimed in a  breath; and down everyone put her basket, and set her arms a-kembo, unanimously  declaring, they would shame him for such stinginess.  The most violent abuse now followed, the boy imitating them, and every other  sentence concluding with—'A pot of beer for four!—ha!'  Camilla and Eugenia, both frightened, besought that they might have any thing,  and every thing, that could appease them; but Mr. Dubster was inflexible not to  submit to imposition, because of a few foul words; 'For, dear heart,' said he,  'what harm will they do us!—they an't of no consequence.'  Then, addressing them again, 'As to four,' he cried, 'that's one over the  bargain, for I did not reckon the boy for nothing.'  'You didn't, didn't you?' cried the boy; 'i'cod, I hope I'm as good as you, any  day in the year!'  'You'll thank us kindly, will you?' said one of the women; 'I'fackens, and so  you shall, when we're fools enough to sarve you!—A pot of beer for four!'  'We help you down!—we get you a ladder!' cried another; 'yes, forsooth, it's  like we may!—no, stay where you are like a toad in a hole as you be!'  Camilla and Eugenia now, tired of vain application to Mr. Dubster, who heard  all this abuse with the most sedate unconcern, advanced themselves to the  window; and Eugenia, ever foremost where money was to be given, began—'Good  women——' when, with a violent loud shout, they called out—'What! are you  all in Hob's pound? Well, they as will may let you out for we; so I wish you a  merry time of it!'  Eugenia began again her—'Good women——' when the boy exclaimed—'What  were you put up there for, Miss? to frighten the crows?'  Eugenia, not understanding him, was once more re-commencing; but the first  woman said—'I suppose you think we'll sarve you for looking at?—no need to  be paid?'  'Yes, yes,' cried the second, 'Miss may go to market with her beauty; she'll  not want for nothing if she'll shew her pretty face!'  'She need not be afeard of it, however,' said the third, 'for 'twill never be  no worse. Only take care, Miss, you don't catch the small pox!'  'O fegs, that would be pity!' cried the boy, 'for fear Miss should be marked.'  Eugenia, astonished and confounded, made no farther attempt; but Camilla,  though at that moment she could have inflicted any punishment upon such  unprovoked assailants, affected to give but little weight to what they said,  and gently drew her away.  'Hoity, toity!' cried one of the women, as she moved off, 'why, Miss, do you  walk upon your knees?'  'Why my Poll would make two of her,' said another, 'though she's only nine  years old.'  'She won't take much for cloaths,' cried another, 'that's one good thing.'  'I'd answer to make her a gown out of my apron,' said the third.  'Your apron?' cried another, 'your pocket handkerchief you mean!—why she'd be  lost in your apron, and you might look half an hour before you'd find her.'  Eugenia, to whom such language was utterly new, was now in such visible  consternation, that Camilla, affrighted, earnestly charged Mr. Dubster to find  any means, either of menace or of reward, to make them depart.  'Lauk, don't mind them, ma'am,' cried he, following Eugenia, 'they can't do you  no hurt; though they are rather rude, I must needs confess the truth, to say  such things to your face. But one must not expect people to be over polite, so  far from London. However, I see the sporting gentry coming round, over that  way, yonder; and I warrant they'll gallop 'em off. Hark'ee, Mistresses! them  gentlemen that are coming here, shall take you before the justice, for  affronting Sir Hugh's Tyrold's Heiresses to all his fortunes.  The women, to whom the name and generous deeds of Sir Hugh Tyrold were  familiar, were now quieted and dismayed. They offered some aukward apologies,  of not guessing such young ladies could be posted up in such a place; and hoped  it would be no detriment to them at the ensuing Christmas, when the good  Baronet gave away beef and beer; but Mr. Dubster pompously ordered them to make  off, saying, he would not accept the ladder from them now, for the gentry that  were coming would get it for nothing: 'So troop off,' cried he; 'and as for  you,' to the boy, 'you shall have your jacket well trimmed, I promise you: I  know who you are, well enough; and I'll tell your master of you, as sure as  you're alive.'  Away then, with complete, though not well-principled repentance, they all  marched.  Mr. Dubster, turning round with exultation, cried—'I only said that to  frighten them, for I never see 'em before, as I know of. But I don't mind 'em  of a rush; and I hope you don't neither. Though I can't pretend it's over  agreeable being made fun of. If I see anybody snigger at me, I always ask 'em  what it's for; for I'd as lieve they'd let it alone.'  Eugenia, who, as there was no seat, had sunk upon the floor for rest and for  refuge, remained silent, and seemed almost petrified; while Camilla,  affectionately leaning over her, began talking upon other subjects, in hopes to  dissipate a shock she was ashamed to console.  She made no reply, no comment; but, sighed deeply.  'Lauk!' cried Mr. Dubster, 'what's the matter with the young lady! I hope she  don't go for to take to heart what them old women says? she'll be never the  worse to look at, because of their impudence. Besides, fretting does no good to  nothing. If you'll only come and stand here, where I do, Miss, you may have a  peep at ever so many dogs, and all the gentlemen, riding helter skelter round  that hill. It's a pretty sight enough for them as has nothing better to mind. I  don't know but I might make one among them myself, now and then, if it was not  for the expensiveness of hiring of a horse.'  Here some of the party came galloping towards them; and Mr. Dubster made so  loud an outcry, that two or three of the sportsmen looked up, and one of them,  riding close to the summer-house, perceived the two young ladies, and,  instantly dismounting, fastened his horse to a tree, and contrived to scramble  up into the little unfinished building.  Camilla then saw it was Major Cerwood. She explained to him the mischievous  frolick of her brother, and accepted his offered services to find the ladder  and the carriage.  Eugenia meanwhile rose and courtsied in answer to his enquiries after her  health, and then, gravely fixing her eyes upon the ground, took no further  notice of him.  The object of the Major was not Eugenia; her taciturnity therefore did not  affect him; but pleased to be shut up with Camilla, he soon found out that  though to mount had been easy, to descend would be difficult; and, after  various mock efforts, pronounced it would be necessary to wait till some  assistance arrived from below: adding, young Mr. Tyrold would soon return, as  he had seen him in the hunt.  Camilla, whose concern now was all for her sister, heard this with  indifference; but Mr. Dubster lost all patience. 'So here,' said he, 'I may  stay, and let Tom Hicks eat up all my dinner! for I can't expect him to fast,  because of this young gentleman's comical tricks. I've half a mind to give a  jump down myself, and go look for the ladder; only I'm not over light. Besides,  if one should break one's leg, it's but a hard thing upon a man to be a cripple  in the middle of life. It's no such great hindrance to a lady, so I don't say  it out of disrespect; because ladies can't do much at the best.'  The Major, finding Dubster was his host, thought it necessary to take some  notice of him, and ask him if he never rode out.  'Why no, not much of that, Sir,' he answered; 'for when a man's not over used  to riding, one's apt to get a bad tumble sometimes. I believe it's as well let  alone. I never see as there was much wit in breaking one's neck before one's  time. Besides, half them gentlemen are no better than sharpers, begging pardon,  for all they look as if they could knock one down.'  'How do you mean sharpers, Sir?'  'Why they don't pay everyone his own, not one in ten of them. And they're as  proud as Lucifer. If I was to go among them to-morrow, I'll lay a wager they'd  take no notice of me: unless I was to ask them to dinner. And a man may soon  eat up his substance, if he's so over complaisant.'  'Surely, Major,' cried Camilla, 'my brother cannot be much longer before he  joins us?—remembers us rather.'  'Who else could desert or forget you?' cried the Major.  'It's a moot point whether he'll come or no, I see that,' said Mr. Dubster,  quite enraged; 'them young 'squires never know what to do for their fun. I must  needs say I think it's pity but what he'd been brought up to some calling.  'Twould have steadied him a little, I warrant. He don't seem to know much of  the troubles of life.'  A shower of rain now revived his hopes that the fear of being wet might bring  him back; not considering how little sportsmen regard wet jackets.  'However,' continued he, 'it's really a piece of good luck that he was not  taken with a fancy to leave us upon my island; and then we might all have been  soused by this here rain: and he could just as well have walked off with my  bridge as with the ladder.'  Here, to his inexpressible relief, Lionel, from the road, hailed them; and  Camilla, with emotion the most violent, perceived Edgar was by his side.  Mr. Dubster, however, angry as well as glad, very solemnly said, 'I wonder,  Sir, what you think my workmen has been doing all this time, with nobody to  look after them? Besides that I promised a pot o'beer to a lad to wheel me away  all that rubbish that I'd cut out of my grotto; and it's a good half day's  work, do it who will; and ten to one if they've stirred a nail, all left to  themselves so.'  'Pho, pho, man, you've been too happy, I hope, to trouble your mind about  business. How do do my little girls? how you have been entertained?'  'This is a better joke to you than to us 'squire; but pray, Sir, begging  pardon, how come you to forget what I told you about the Globe? I know very  well that they say it's quite alley-mode to make fun, but I can't pretend as  I'm over fond of the custom.'  He then desired that, at least, if he would not get the ladder himself, he  would tell that other gentleman, that was with him, what he had done with it.  Edgar, having met Lionel, and heard from him how and where he had left his  sisters, had impatiently ridden with him to their relief; but when he saw that  the Major made one in the little party, and that he was standing by Camilla, he  felt hurt and amazed, and proceeded no farther.  Camilla believed herself careless of his opinion; what she had heard from Miss  Margland of his professed indifference, gave her now as much resentment, as at  first it had caused her grief. She thought such a declaration an unprovoked  indignity; she deigned not even to look at him, resolved for ever to avoid him;  yet to prove herself, at the same time, unmortified and disengaged, talked  cheerfully with the Major.  Lionel now, producing the ladder, ran up it to help his sisters to descend; and  Edgar, dismounting, could not resist entering the grounds, to offer them his  hand as they came down.  Eugenia was first assisted; for Camilla talked on with the Major, as if not  hearing she was called: and Mr. Dubster, his complaisance wholly worn out, next  followed, bowing low to everyone separately, and begging pardon, but saying he  could really afford to waste no more time, without going to give a little look  after his workmen, to see if they were alive or dead.  At this time the horse of the Major, by some accident, breaking loose, his  master was forced to run down, and Lionel scampered after to assist him.  Camilla remained alone; Edgar, slowly mounting the ladder, gravely offered his  services; but, hastily leaning out of the window, she pretended to be too much  occupied in watching the motions of the Major and his horse, to hear or attend  to any thing else.  A sigh now tore the heart of Edgar, from doubt if this were preference to the  Major, or the first dawn of incipient coquetry; but he called not upon her  again; he stood quietly behind, till the horse was seized, and the Major  re-ascended the ladder. They then stood at each side of it, with offers of  assistance.  This appeared to Camilla a fortunate moment for making a spirited display of  her indifference: she gave her hand to the Major, and, slightly courtesying to  Edgar as she passed, was conducted to the carriage of her uncle.  Lionel again was the only one who spoke in the short route to Etherington,  whence Eugenia, without alighting, returned to Cleves.
