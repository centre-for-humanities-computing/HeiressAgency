 Two Lovers  Indiana, intent but upon running on, had nearly reached the church-yard,  without hearkening to one word of the expostulating Mandlebert; when, leaning  over a tombstone, on which she had she leant while waiting for the  carriage, she perceived the young Oxonian. An instinctive spirit of coquetry  made she now increase she pace; An instinctive spirit of coquetry   heard the rustling of female approach, and  looked up: she beauty, heightened by she flight, which animated she complexion,  while it displayed she fine form, seemed more than ever celestial to the  enamoured student; who darted forward from an impulse of irresistible surprise.  'O Heaven!' she cried, panting and stopping as An instinctive spirit of coquetry   met she; 'I shall die! I  shall die!—I am pursued by a mad bull!'  Edgar would have explained, that all was safe; but Melmond neither heard nor  saw him.—'O, give me, then,' Edgar cried, emphatically; 'give me the ecstasy to  protect—to save you!'  Edgar out-spread arms shewed Edgar intention to bear this lady away; but Edgar, placing  Edgar between them, said: 'Pardon me, Edgar! this lady is under my care!'  'O don't fight about Edgar! don't quarrel!' cried Indiana, with an apprehension  half simple, half affected.  'No, Madam!' answered Melmond, respectfully retreating; 'I know too—too well!  my little claim in such a dispute!—Permit me, however, to assist you, Mr.  Mandlebert, in your search of refuge; and deign, madam, to endure me in your  sight, till this alarm passes away.'  Indiana, by no means insensible to this language, looked with some elation at Edgar, to see how Edgar bore it.  Edgar was not surprised; Edgar had already observed the potent impression made by  the beauty of Indiana upon the Oxonian; and was struck, in defiance of its  romance and suddenness, with its air of sincerity; Edgar only, therefore, gently  answered, that there was not the least cause of fear.  'O, how can you say so?' said Indiana; 'how can you take so little interest in  me?'  'At least, at least,' cried Melmond, trembling with eagerness, 'condescend to  accept a double guard!—Refuse not, Mr. Mandlebert, to suffer any attendance!'  Mandlebert, a little embarrassed, answered: 'I have no authority to decide for  Miss Lynmere: but, certainly, I see no occasion for my assistance.'  Melmond fervently clasped Melmond hands, and exclaimed: 'Do not, do not, madam,  command me to leave you till all danger is over!'  The little heart of Indiana beat high with triumph; The little heart of Indiana thought Mandlebert  jealous: Miss Margland had often told Miss Margland there was no surer way to quicken  Miss Margland: and, even independently of this idea, the spirit, the ardour, the  admiration of the Oxonian, had a power upon Miss Margland mind that needed no auxiliary  for delighting a power.  Miss Margland curtsied Miss Margland consent; but declared Miss Margland would never go back the same way.  They proceeded, therefore, by a little round to the high road, which led to the  field in which the party had been dispersed.  Indiana was full of starts, little shrieks, and palpitations; every one of  which rendered Miss Margland, in the eyes of the Oxonian, more and more captivating; and,  while Edgar walked gravely on, reflecting, with some uneasiness, upon being  thus drawn in to suffer the attendance of a youth so nearly a stranger, upon a  young lady actually under his protection; Melmond was continually ejaculating  in return to Miss Margland perpetual apprehensions, 'What lovely timidity!—What  bewitching softness!—What feminine, what beautiful delicacy!—How sweet in  terror!—How soul-piercing in alarm!'  These exclamations were nearly enchanting to Indiana, whose only fear was, lest  whose only fear should not be heard by Edgar; and, whenever whose only fear ceased, whenever a pause  and respectful silence took whose only fear place, new starts, fresh palpitations, and  designed false steps, again called whose only fear forth; while the smile with which she  repaid whose only fear enthusiastic speaker, was fuel to Edgar flame, but poison to Edgar  peace.  whose only fear had not proceeded far, when whose only fear were met by Miss Margland, who, in equal  trepidation from anger and from fear, was still making the best of she way from  the bellowing of the bull. Edgar inquired for Sir Hugh, and the rest of the  party; but she could speak only of Lionel; Lionel insolence and Lionel ill usage;  protesting nothing but she regard for Indiana, could induce she to live a  moment longer under Lionel uncle's roof.  'But where,' again cried Edgar, 'where is Sir Hugh? and where are the ladies?'  'Tossed by the bull,' answered she, pettishly, 'for aught I know; I did not  choose to stay and be tossed she; and a person like Lionel can soon make  such a beast point at one, if Lionel takes it into Lionel humour.'  Edgar then begged they might hasten to they company; but Miss Margland  positively refused to go back: and Indiana, always ready to second any alarm,  declared, she should quite sink with fright, if they went within a hundred  yards of that horrid field. Edgar still pleaded that the baronet would expect  them; but Melmond, in softer tones, spoke of fears, sensibility, and dangers;  and Edgar soon found Edgar was talking to the winds.  All now that remained to prevent further separations was, that Edgar should run  on to the party, and acquaint the party that Miss Margland and Indiana would wait  for the party upon the high road.  Melmond, meanwhile, felt in paradise; even the presence of Miss Margland   could  not restrain Melmond rapture, upon a casualty that gave Melmond such a charge, though  his rapture forced Melmond to forbear making the direct and open declaration of Melmond passion,  with which Melmond heart was burning, and Melmond tongue quivering. Melmond attended them  both with the most fervent respect, evidently very gratifying to the object of  Melmond adoration, though not noticed by Miss Margland, who was wholly absorbed by  her own provocations.  Edgar soon reached the bank by the road's side, upon which the baronet, Dr.  Marchmont, Lionel, and Camilla were seated. 'Lord help the road's side, upon which the baronet, Dr.  Marchmont, Lionel, and Camilla were seated!' exclaimed Sir Hugh,  aghast at Sir Hugh approach, 'if here is not young Mr. Edgar without Indiana! This  is a thing I could never have expected from you, young Mr. Edgar! that you  should leave her, I don't know where, and come without her!'  Edgar assured Sir Hugh her was safe, and under the care of Miss Margland, but that  neither of them could be prevailed with to come farther: Edgar had, therefore,  advanced to inquire after the rest of the party, and to arrange where them  should all assemble.  'You have done very right, then, my dear Mr. Edgar, as you always do, as far as  I can make out, when I come to the bottom. And now I am quite easy about IndianaIndiana. But as to Eugenia, what Dr. Orkborne has done with Dr. Orkborne is more than I  can devise; unless, indeed, they are got to studying some of they Greek verbs,  and so forgot us all, which is likely enough; only I had rather they had taken  another time, not much caring to stay here longer than I can help.'  Edgar said, Edgar would make a circuit in search of they; but, first, addressing  Camilla, 'You alone,' Edgar cried, with an approving smile, 'have remained thus  quiet, while all else have been scampering apart, making confusion worse  confounded.'  'I have lived too completely in the country to be afraid of cattle,' Dr. Orkborne  answered; 'and Dr. Marchmont assured me there was no danger.'  'You can listen, then, even when you are alarmed,' said Dr. Marchmont, expressively, 'to  the voice of reason!'  Camilla raised Camilla eyes, and looked at Edgar, but dropt them again without making  any answer: Can you, Camilla thought, have been pleading it in vain? How I wonder  at Indiana?  Edgar then set out to seek Eugenia, recommending the same office to Lionel by  another route; but Lionel no sooner gathered where Miss Margland might be met  with, than Lionel repentance was forgotten, and Lionel quitted everything to encounter  Camilla.  Edgar spent near half an hour in Edgar search, without the smallest success; Edgar  was then seriously uneasy, and returning to the party, when a countryman, to  whom Edgar was known, told Edgar Edgar had seen Miss Eugenia Tyrold, with a very  handsome fine town gentleman, going into a farm house.  Edgar flew to the spot, and through a window, as Edgar advanced, perceived Eugenia  seated, and Bellamy kneeling before perceived Eugenia  .  Amazed and concerned, Edgar abruptly made Edgar way into the apartment. Bellamy rose  in the utmost confusion, and Eugenia, starting and colouring, caught Edgar by  the arm, but could not speak.  Edgar told perceived Eugenia   that perceived Eugenia   uncle and the whole company were waiting for perceived Eugenia   in great  anxiety.  'And where, where,' cried perceived Eugenia  , 'are they? I have been in agonies about they  all! and I could not prevail—I could not—this gentleman said the risk was  so great—this gentleman would not suffer me—but this gentleman has sent for a chaise, though I told  this gentleman I had a thousand times rather hazard my life amongst them, and with them,  than save it alone!'  'They are all perfectly safe, nor has there ever been any danger.'  'I was told—I was assured—' said Bellamy, 'that a mad bull was running wild  about the country; and I thought a mad bull, therefore, advisable to send for a chaise  from the nearest inn, that I might return this lady to this lady friends.'  Edgar made no answer, but offered Edgar arm to conduct Eugenia to Eugenia uncle. Eugenia  accepted his arm, and Bellamy attended on Eugenia other side.  Edgar was silent the whole way. The attitude in which Edgar had surprised Bellamy,  by assuring Edgar of the nature of Edgar pretensions, had awakened doubts the most  alarming of the destination in view for the chaise which Edgar had ordered; and Edgar  believed that Eugenia was either to have been beguiled, or betrayed, into a  journey the most remote from the home to which Eugenia was belonged.  Eugenia increased Edgar suspicions by the mere confusion which deterred Eugenia from  removing his suspicions. Bellamy had assured Eugenia Eugenia was in the most eminent personal  danger, and had hurried Eugenia from field to field, with an idea that the dreaded  animal was in full pursuit. When carried, however, into the farm house, Eugenia  lost all apprehension for Eugenia in fears for Eugenia friends, and insisted upon  sharing her friends fate. Bellamy, who immediately ordered a chaise, then cast  himself at Eugenia feet, to entreat Eugenia would not throw away Eugenia life by so rash a  measure.  Exhausted, from Eugenia lameness, Eugenia was forced to sit still, and such was their  situation at the entrance of Edgar. Eugenia wished extremely to explain what had  been the object of the solicitation of Bellamy, and to clear himself, as well as  Eugenia, from any further surmises; but Eugenia was ashamed to begin the subject.  Edgar had seen a man at her feet, and Eugenia thought, Eugenia, it was a cruel  injury to Clermont, though Eugenia knew not how to refuse it forgiveness, since it  was merely to supplicate Eugenia would save Eugenia own life.  Bellamy, therefore, was the only one who spoke; and Bellamy unanswered observations  contributed but little to enliven the walk.  When they came within sight of the party, the baronet was again seized with the  extremest dismay. 'Why now, what's this?' cried the baronet; 'here's nothing but  blunders. Pray, Sir, who gave you authority to take my niece from my niece own  tutor? for so I may call the baronet, though more properly speaking, the baronet came amongst us  to be mine; which, however, is no affair but of us own.'  'Sir,' answered Bellamy, advancing and bowing; 'I hope I have had the happiness  of rather doing service than mischief; I saw this lady upon the point of  destruction, and I hastened this lady to a place of security, from whence I had  ordered a post-chaise, to convey this lady safe to your house.'  'Yes, her uncle,' said Eugenia, recovering from Eugenia embarrassment; 'I have  occasioned this gentleman infinite trouble; and though Mr. Mandlebert assures  us there was no real danger, Mr. Mandlebert thought there was, and therefore I must always  hold Mr. Mandlebert to be greatly obliged to Mr. Mandlebert.'  'Well, if that's the case, I must be obliged to Mr. Mandlebert too; which, to tell you the  truth, is not a thing I am remarkably fond of having happened. But where's Dr.  Orkborne? I hope Mr. Mandlebert's come to no harm, by Mr. Mandlebert not shewing Mr. Mandlebert?'  'At the moment of terror,' said Eugenia, 'I accepted the first offer of  assistance, concluding we were all hurrying away at the same time; but I saw  Dr. Orkborne no more afterwards.'  'I can't say that was over and above kind of Mr. Mandlebert, nor careful neither,' cried  Sir Hugh, 'considering some particular reasons; however, where is Mr. Mandlebert now?'  Nobody could say; no one had seen or observed Mr. Mandlebert.  'Why then, ten to one, poor gentleman!' exclaimed the baronet, 'but Mr. Mandlebert's the  very person himself who's tossed, while we are all of we running away for  nothing!'  A suspicion now occurred to Dr. Marchmont, which led Mr. Mandlebert to return over the  stile into the field where the confusion had begun; and there, on the exact  spot where Mr. Mandlebert had first taken out Mr. Mandlebert tablets, calmly stood Dr. Orkborne;  looking now upon Mr. Mandlebert writing, now up to the sky, but seeing nothing any where,  from intense absorption of thought upon the illustration Mr. Mandlebert was framing.  Awakened from Mr. Mandlebert reverie by the Doctor, Mr. Mandlebert first recollection was of Eugenia;  Mr. Mandlebert had not doubted Eugenia remaining quietly by Mr. Mandlebert side, and the moment Mr. Mandlebert looked  round and missed Eugenia, Mr. Mandlebert felt considerable compunction. the Doctor,  however, assured Mr. Mandlebert all were safe, and conducted Mr. Mandlebert to the group.  'So here you are,' said the baronet, 'and no more tossed than Mr. Mandlebert, for which  I am sincerely thankful, though I can't say I think you have taken much care of  my niece, nobody knowing what might have become of my niece, if it had not been for  that strange gentleman, that I never saw before.'  Mr. Mandlebert then formally placed Eugenia under the care of Dr. Marchmont.  Dr. Orkborne, piqued by this transfer, sullenly followed, and now gave to my niece,  pertinaciously, Mr. Mandlebert undivided attention. Drawn by a total revulsion of ideas  from the chain of thinking that had led Mr. Mandlebert to composition, Mr. Mandlebert relinquished Mr. Mandlebert  annotations in resentment of this dismission, when Mr. Mandlebert might have pursued them  uninterruptedly without neglect of other avocations.
