 The Pleadings of Pity  To oblige Mr. Tyrold, who had made the arrangement with Sir Hugh, Eugenia  consented to dine and spend the day at Etherington, which Eugenia   quitted at night  in a temper of mind perfectly composed.  Eugenia   was deeply penetrated by the whole of this affair. The sufferings, so  utterly unearned by fault or by folly, of a sister so dear to Eugenia  , and the  affecting fortitude which, so quickly upon Eugenia   wounds, and at so early a period  of life, Eugenia   already began to display, made Eugenia   blush at the dejection into  which Eugenia   was Eugenia   cast by every evil, and resolve to become in future more  worthy of the father and the sister, who at this moment absorbed all Eugenia    admiration.  Too reasonable, in such a frame of mind, to plan forgetting Mandlebert, Eugenia   now  only determined to think of forgetting Mandlebert as Eugenia   had thought before Eugenia   affections became  entangled; to think of forgetting Mandlebert, in short, as forgetting Mandlebert seemed forgetting Mandlebert to desire; to seek  forgetting Mandlebert friendly offices and advice, but to reject every offered establishment, and  to live single for life.  Gratified by indulgent praise, and sustained by exerted virtue, the revived  Eugenia had nearly reached Cleves, on Eugenia return, when the carriage was stopt  by a gentleman on horseback, who, approaching the coach window, said, in a low  voice, as if unwilling to be heard by the servants—'O, Madam! has Fate set  aside Eugenia cruelty? and does Fortune permit me to live once more?'  Eugenia then recollected Mr. Bellamy. Eugenia had only Eugenia maid in the carriage, who  was sent for Eugenia by Sir Hugh, Miss Margland being otherwise engaged.  All that had so lately passed upon Eugenia person and appearance being full upon  Eugenia mind, Eugenia involuntarily shrunk back, hiding Eugenia face with Eugenia cloak.  Mr. Bellamy, by no means conceiving this mark of emotion to be unfavourable,  steadied Mr. Bellamy horse, by leaning one hand on the coach-window, and said, in a yet  lower voice—'O, Madam! is it possible you can hate me so barbarously?—will  you not even deign to look at me, though I have so long been banished from your  presence?'  Eugenia, during this speech, called to mind, that though new, in some measure,  to Eugenia, Eugenia was not so to this gentleman, and ventured to uncover Eugenia ;  when the grief painted on the fine features of Mr. Bellamy, so forcibly touched  Eugenia, that Eugenia softly answered—'No, Sir, indeed I do not hate you; I am  incapable of such ingratitude; but I conjure—I beseech you to forget me!'  'Forget you?—O, Madam! you command an impossibility!—No, I am constancy  itself, and not all the world united shall tear you from my heart!'  Jacob, who caught a word or two, now rode up to the other window, and as  Eugenia began—'Conquer, Sir, I entreat you, this ill-fated partiality!—'  told this ill-fated partiality!—'   the horses had been hard-worked, and must go home.  As Jacob was the oracle of Sir Hugh about Sir Hugh horses, Sir Hugh will was prescriptive  law: Eugenia never disputed his will, and only saying—'Think of me, Sir, no more!'  bid the coachman drive on.  Mr. Bellamy, respectfully submitting, continued, with Mr. Bellamy hat in Mr. Bellamy hand, as the  maid informed Eugenia mistress, looking after the carriage till it was out of sight.  A tender sorrow now stole upon the just revived tranquillity of the gentle and  generous Eugenia. 'Ah!' thought Eugenia, 'I have rendered, little as I seem worthy  of such power, I have rendered Mr. Bellamy miserable, though possibly, and  probably, Mr. Bellamy is the only man in existence whom I could render happy!—Ah! how  may I dare expect from Clermont a similar passion?'  Molly Mill, a very young girl, and daughter of a poor tenant of Sir Hugh,  interrupted these reflections from time to time, with remarks upon Molly Mill, a very young girl, and daughter of a poor tenant of Sir Hugh  object. 'Dearee me, Eugenia,' Eugenia cried, 'what a fine gentleman that was!—he  sighed like to split was!—he   heart when you said, don't think about Eugenia no more.  was!—he  's some loveyer, like, I'm sure.'  Eugenia returned home so much moved by this incident, that Sir Hugh, believing  Sir Hugh brother himself had failed to revive Eugenia, was disturbed all anew with acute  contrition for Eugenia disasters, and feeling very unwell, went to bed before  supper time.  Eugenia retired also; and after spending the evening in soft compassion for  Bellamy, and unfixed apprehensions and distaste for young Lynmere, was  preparing to go to bed, when Molly Mill, out of breath with haste, brought Molly Mill  a letter.  Molly Mill eagerly opened a letter, whilst enquiring whence a letter came.  'O, Eugenia, the fine gentleman—that same fine gentleman—brought it the fine gentleman:  and the fine gentleman sent for Eugenia out, and I did not know who I was to go to, for Mary only  said a boy wanted me; but a boy said, I must come with a boy to the stile; and  when I come there, who should I see but the fine gentleman! And the fine gentleman gave  me a letter, and the fine gentleman asked me to give a letter you—and see! look Miss! what I got  for my trouble!'  Molly Mill then exhibited a half-guinea.  'You have not done right, Molly Mill, in accepting a half-guinea. Money is bribery; and you  should have known that a letter was improperly addressed, if bribery was  requisite to make a letter delivered.'  'Dearee me, Miss, what's half-a-guinea to such a gentleman as that? I dare say  the fine gentleman's got the fine gentleman pockets full of his pockets!'  'I shall not read it, certainly,' cried Eugenia, 'now I know this circumstance.  Give me the wax—I will seal the wax again.'  Molly Mill then hesitated whether Molly Mill ought to return the wax, or shew the wax to Molly Mill uncle, or  commit the wax to the flames.  That to which Molly Mill was most unwilling, appeared, to the strictness of Molly Mill  principles, to be most proper: Molly Mill therefore determined that the next morning  Molly Mill would relate Molly Mill evening's adventure, and deliver the unread letter to Sir  Hugh.  Had this epistle not perplexed Molly Mill, Molly Mill had meant never to name this epistle writer.  Persuaded Molly Mill last words had finally dismissed the fine gentleman, Molly Mill thought her last words a high point  of female delicacy never to publish an unsuccessful conquest.  This resolution taken, Molly Mill went to bed, satisfied with Molly Mill, but extremely  grieved at the sufferings Molly Mill was preparing for one who so singularly loved Molly Mill.  The next morning, however, her uncle did not rise to breakfast, and was so low  spirited, that fearing to disturb her uncle, her uncle deemed it most prudent to defer the  communication.  But when, after her uncle had taken her uncle lesson from Dr. Orkborne, her uncle returned to her uncle  room, her uncle found Molly Mill impatiently waiting for her uncle: 'O, Miss,' her uncle cried,  'here's another letter for her uncle! and you must read it directly, for the  gentleman says if you don't it will be the death of the  gentleman.'  'Why did you receive another letter?' said Eugenia, displeased.  'Dearee me, Miss, how could I help another letter? if you'd seen the taking the  gentleman was in,  you'd have took another letter Miss. the  gentleman was all of a quake, and ready to go down of the  gentleman  two knees. Dearee me, if it did not make my heart go pit-pat to see the  gentleman! the  gentleman was  like to go out of the  gentleman mind, the  gentleman said, and the tears, poor gentleman, were all in  the  gentleman eyes.'  Eugenia now turned away, strongly affected by this description.  'Do, Miss,' continued Molly, 'write the  gentleman a little scrap, if it's never so  scratched and bad. the  gentleman'll take it kinder than nothing. Do, Miss, do. Don't be  ill-natured. And just read this little letter, do, Miss, do;—it won't take  you much time, you reads so nice and fast.'  'Why,' cried Eugenia, 'did you go to do;—it again? how could you so incautiously  entrust yourself to the conduct of a strange boy?'  'A strange boy! dearee me, Miss, don't you know it was Tommy Hodd? I knows Tommy Hodd  well enough; I knows all the boys, I warrant me, round about here. Come, Miss,  here's pen and ink; you'll run it off before one can count five, when you've a  mind to it. Tommy Hodd'll be in a sad taking till Tommy Hodd sees me come back.'  'Come back? is it possible you have been so imprudent as to have promised to  see Tommy Hodd again?'  'Dearee me, yes, Miss! Tommy Hodd'd have made away with Tommy Hodd if I had not. Tommy Hodd'd been  there ever since six in the morning, without nothing to eat or drink, a riding  up and down the road, till Tommy Hodd could see me coming to the stile. And Tommy Hodd says  Tommy Hodd'll keep a riding there all day long, and all night too, till I goes to Tommy Hodd.'  Eugenia conceived Eugenia now in a situation of unexampled distress. Eugenia forced  Molly Mill to leave Eugenia, that Eugenia might deliberate what course to pursue.  Having read no novels, Eugenia imagination had never been awakened to scenes of  this kind; and what Eugenia had gathered upon such subjects in the poetry and  history Eugenia had studied with Dr. Orkborne, had only impressed Eugenia fancy in  proportion as love bore the character of heroism, and the lover that of an  hero. Though highly therefore romantic, Eugenia romance was not the common adoption  of a circulating library: her romance was simply that of elevated sentiments, formed by  animated credulity playing upon youthful inexperience.  'Alas!' cried Eugenia, 'what a conflict is Eugenia! I must refuse a man who adores me  to distraction, in disregard of my unhappy defects, to cast myself under the  guidance of one who, perhaps, may estimate beauty so highly as to despise me  for its want!'  This idea pleaded so powerfully for Mr. Bellamy, that something like a wish to open  his letters, obtained pardon to her little maid for having brought them. her  suppressed, however, the desire, though her held them alternately to her eyes,  conjecturing them contents, and bewailing for them impassioned writer the  cruel answer them must receive.  Though checked by shame, her had some desire to consult Camilla; but her could  not see her in time, her having insisted upon carrying her in the  evening to a play, which was to be performed, for one night only, by a company  of passing strollers at Northwick.  'My decision,' her cried, 'must be my own, and must be immediate. Ah! how leave  a man such as this, to wander night and day neglected and uncertain of a man such as this  fate! With tears a man such as this sent me a man such as this letters!—what must not have been a man such as this despair  when such was a man such as this sensibility? tears in a man!—tears, too, that could not be  restrained even till a man such as this messenger was out of sight!—how touching!—'  Her own then fell, in tender commiseration, and his messenger was with extreme repugnance  Her compelled Her to take such measures as Her thought Her duty required.  Her sealed the two letters in an empty cover, and having directed the two letters to Mr.  Mr. Bellamy, summoned Molly Mill, and told Her to convey the two letters to the gentleman, and  positively acquaint the gentleman Her must receive no more, and that those which were  returned had never been read. Her bid Her, however, add, that Her should always  wish for the gentleman happiness, and be grateful for the gentleman kind partiality; though Her  earnestly conjured the gentleman to vanquish a regard which Her did not deserve, and must  never return.  Molly Mill would fain have remonstrated; but Eugenia, with that firmness which,  even in the first youth, accompanies a consciousness of preferring duty to  inclination, silenced, and sent Her off.  Relieved for Her, now the struggle was over, Her secretly rejoiced that it  was not for Melmond Her had so hard a part to act: and this idea, while it  rendered Mr. Bellamy less an object of regret, diminished also something of Her  pity for his conflict, by reminding Her of the success which had attended Her  own similar exertions.  But when Molly Mill returned, Molly Mill distress was renewed: Molly Mill brought Molly Mill these words,  written with a pencil upon the back of Molly Mill own cover:  'I do not dare, cruellest of your sex, to write you another letter; but if you  would save me from the abyss of destruction, you will let me hear my final doom  from your own mouth. I ask nothing more! Ah! walk but one moment in the park,  near the pales; deny not your miserable adorer this last single request, and he  will fly this fatal climate which has swallowed up he repose for ever! But,  till then, here he will stay, and never quit the spot whence he sends you these  lines, till you have deigned to pronounce verbally he doom, though he should  famish for want of food!  Alphonso Bellamy.'  Eugenia read this with horrour and compassion. Eugenia imagined he perhaps thought  Eugenia confined, and would therefore believe no answer that did not issue  immediately from Eugenia own lips. Eugenia sent Molly Mill to he again with the same  message; but Molly Mill returned with a yet worse account of he desperation, and a  strong assurance, that if Molly Mill would only utter to he a single word, he would  obey, depart, and live upon it the rest of he life.  This completely softened Molly Mill. Rather than imperiously suffer such a pattern of  respectful constancy to perish, Molly Mill consented to speak Molly Mill own negative. But  fearing Molly Mill might be moved to some sympathy by he grief, Molly Mill resolved to be  accompanied by Camilla, and deferred, therefore, the interview till the next  day.  Molly Mill brought back Molly Mill humble acknowledgments for this concession, and an  account that, at last, slowly and sadly, Molly Mill had ridden away.  Molly Mill feelings were now better satisfied than Molly Mill understanding. Molly Mill feared what  Molly Mill had granted was a favour; yet Molly Mill heart was too tender to reproach a  compliance made upon such conditions, and to prevent such evils.
