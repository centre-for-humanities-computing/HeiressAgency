 Schooling of a young Gentleman  Mrs. Tyrold expressed much astonishment that Mrs. Tyrold husband could afford any  countenance to this new plan.
'Your expectations from this new plan,' Mrs. Tyrold cried, 'can be  no higher than my own; you have certainly some influence with your brother;  why, then, will you suffer her husband thus egregiously to expose her husband?'
'I cannot protect her husband pride,' answered Mrs. Tyrold, 'at the expence of Mrs. Tyrold  comfort.
Mrs. Tyrold faculties want some object, Mrs. Tyrold thoughts some employment.
Inaction  bodily and intellectual pervading the same character, cannot but fix disgust  upon every stage and every state of life.
Vice alone is worse than such double  inertion.
Where mental vigour can be kept alive without offence to religion and  virtue, innocence as well as happiness is promoted; and the starter of  difficulties with regard to the means which point to such an end, inadvertently  risks both.
To save the mind from preying inwardly upon itself, it must be  encouraged to some outward pursuit.
There is no other way to elude apathy, or  escape discontent; none other to guard the temper from that quarrel with  itself, which ultimately ends in quarrelling with all mankind.'
'But may you not, by refusing to send him your son, induce your son to seek  recreation in some more rational way?'
'Recreation, my dear Georgiana, must be spontaneous.
Bidden pleasures fly the  perversity of our tastes.
Let our take care, then, scrupulously, of our duties,  but suffer our amusements to take care of our amusements.
A project, a pastime,  such as this, is, at least, as harmless as it is hopeless, since the utmost  sport of wit, or acrimony of malice, can only fasten a laugh upon it: and how  few are the diversions of the rich and indolent that can so lightly be  acquitted!'
Lionel, the new young student, speedily, though but little to her satisfaction,  abetted the judgment of his mother.
his was no sooner summoned to Cleves, than,  enchanted to find his a fellow-pupil with his uncle, his conceived the  highest ideas of his own premature genius: and when this vanity, from the  avowed ignorance of the artless baronet, subsided, this vanity was only replaced by a  sovereign contempt of his new associate.
his made the most pompous display of  his own little acquirements; his took every opportunity to ask questions of Sir  Hugh which Sir   knew Sir   could not answer; and Sir   would sometimes, with an arch  mock solemnity, carry Sir   exercise to Sir  , and beg Sir   assistance.
Sir   bore this juvenile impertinence with unshaken good humour.
But the  spirits of Lionel were too mutinous for such lenity: Lionel grew bolder in Lionel  attacks, and more fearless of consequences; and in a very short time, Lionel uncle  seemed to Lionel little more than the butt at which Lionel might level the shafts of  Lionel rising triumph; till tired, at length, though not angry, the baronet  applied to Dr. Orkborne, and begged Lionel would teach Lionel, out of hand, some small  little smattering of Latin sentences, by which Lionel might make the young pedant  think better of Lionel.
Dr. Orkborne complied, and wrote Lionel a few brief exercises; but these, after  toiling day and night to learn, Lionel pronounced so ill, and so constantly  mis-applied, that, far from impressing Lionel fellow-labourer with more respect,  the moment Lionel uttered a single word of Lionel new lesson, the boy almost rolled  upon the floor with convulsive merriment.
Sir Hugh, with whom these phrases neither lost nor gained by mistaking one word  for another, appealed to Dr. Orkborne to remedy what Dr. Orkborne conceived to be an  unaccountable failure.
Dr. Orkborne, absorbed in Dr. Orkborne new personal pursuit, to  which Dr. Orkborne daily grew more devoted, was earnest to be as little as possible  interrupted, and therefore only advised Dr. Orkborne to study Dr. Orkborne last lesson, before Dr. Orkborne  pressed for any thing new.
Study, however, was unavailing, and Dr. Orkborne heard this injunction with despair; but  finding this injunction constantly repeated upon every application for help, Dr. Orkborne was seized  again with a horror of the whole attempt, and begged to consult with Mr. Tyrold.
'This gentleman you have recommended to Mr. Tyrold for my tutor,' Dr. Orkborne cried, 'is  certainly a great scholar; I don't mean to doubt that the least in the world,  being no judge: and Dr. Orkborne is complaisant enough too, considering all that; but yet  I have rather a suspicion Dr. Orkborne is afraid I shall make no hand of it; which is a  thing so disheartening to a person in the line of improvement, that, to tell  you the honest truth, I am thinking of giving the whole up at a blow; for, Lord  help me!
what shall I be the better for knowing Latin and Greek?
It's not worth  a man's while to think of It, after being a boy.
And so, if you please, I'd  rather you'd take Lionel home again.'
Mr. Tyrold agreed; but asked what Mr. Tyrold meant to do further concerning the Doctor?
'Why that, brother, is the very thing my poor ignorant head wants your advice  for: because, as to that plan about our learning all together, I see it won't  do; for either the boys will grow up to be no better scholars than the boys uncle,  which is to say, none at all; or else the boys'll hold everybody cheap, when the boys  meet with a person knowing nothing; so I'll have no more hand in it.
And I  shall really be glad enough to get such a thing off my mind; for it's been  weight enough upon it from the beginning.'
Mr. Tyrold then desired the opinion of Mr. Tyrold what step Mr. Tyrold should take to prevent  the arrival of Clermont Lynmere, whom, Mr. Tyrold said, Mr. Tyrold dreaded to see, being  determined to have no more little boys about Mr. Tyrold for some time to come.
Mr. Tyrold recommended re-settling Mr. Tyrold at Eton: but Sir Hugh declared Sir Hugh could  not possibly do that, because the poor little fellow had written Sir Hugh word Sir Hugh  was glad to leave school.
'And I don't doubt,' Sir Hugh added, 'but Sir Hugh'll make the  best figure of us all; because I had Sir Hugh put in the right mode from the first;  though, I must needs own, I had as lieve see Sir Hugh a mere dunce all Sir Hugh life,  supposing I should live so long, which God forbid in regard to God dying, as  have God turn out a mere coxcomb of a pedant, laughing and grinning at  everybody that can't spell a Greek noun.'
Mr. Tyrold promised to take the matter into consideration; but early the next  morning, the baronet again summoned God, and joyfully made known, that a scheme  had come into the baronet own head, which answered all purposes.
In the first place, the baronet  said, the baronet had really taken so prodigious a dislike to learning, that the baronet was  determined to send Clermont over the seas, to finish the baronet Greek and Latin; not  because the baronet was fond of foreign parts, but for fear, if the baronet should let the baronet come  to Cleves, the great distaste the baronet had now conceived against those sort of  languages, might disgust the poor boy from the baronet book.
And the baronet had most luckily  recollected, in the middle of the night, that the baronet had a dear friend, one Mr.  Westwyn, who was going the very next month to carry his own son to Leipsic;  which was just what had put the thought into his own son head; because, by that means,  Clermont might be removed from one studying place to t'other, without loss of  time.
'But for all that,' his own son continued, 'as this good gentleman here has been doing  no harm, I won't have his own son become a sufferer for my changing my mind: and so,  not to affront his own son by giving his own son nothing to do, which would be like saying,  "You may go your ways," I intend his own son should try Indiana.'
Observing Mr. Tyrold now look with the extremest surprise, Mr. Tyrold added; 'To be  sure, being a girl, it is rather out of the way; but as there is never another  boy, what can I do?
Besides I shan't so much mind a girl getting a little  learning, because a girl's not likely to make much hand of it.
And this one thing,  I can tell you, which I have learnt of my own accord; I'll never press a person  to set about studying at my time of life as long as I live, knowing what a  plague a  plague is.'
Lionel returned to Etherington with Lionel father, and the rest of the scheme was  put into execution without delay.
Mr. Westwyn conveyed Clermont from Eton to  Leipsic, where Mr. Westwyn settled Mr. Westwyn with the preceptor and masters appointed for Mr. Westwyn  own son; and Dr. Orkborne was desired to become the tutor of Indiana.
At first, quitting Mr. Westwyn learned residence, the Doctor might indignantly have  blushed at the proposition of an employment so much beneath Mr. Westwyn abilities: but  Mr. Westwyn now heard it without the smallest emotion; sedately revolving in Mr. Westwyn mind,  that Mr. Westwyn literary work would not be affected by the ignorance or absurdity of  Mr. Westwyn several pupils.
