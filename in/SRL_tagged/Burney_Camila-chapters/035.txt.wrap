 Attic Adventures  Mr. Tyrold, according to the system of recreation which he had settled with his  wife, saw with satisfaction the pleasure with which Camilla began this new  acquaintance, in the hope it would help to support her spirits during the  interval of suspense with regard to the purposes of Mandlebert. Mrs. Arlbery  was unknown to him, except by general fame; which told him she was a woman of  reputation as well as fashion, and that though her manners were lively, her  heart was friendly, and her hand ever open to charity.  Upon admitting Lionel again to his presence, he spoke forcibly, though with  brevity, upon the culpability of his conduct. What he had done, he said, let  him colour it to himself with what levity he might, was not only a robbery, but  a robbery of the most atrocious and unjustifiable class; adding terror to  violation of property, and playing upon the susceptibility of the weakness and  infirmities, which he ought to have been the first to have sheltered and  sheathed. Had the action contained no purpose but a frolic, even then the  situation of the object on whom it fell, rendered it inhuman; but as its aim  and end was to obtain money, it was dishonourable to his character, and  criminal by the laws of his country. 'Yet shudder no more,' continued he,  'young man, at the justice to which they make you amenable, than at having  deserved, though you escape it! From this day, however, I will name it no more.  Feeble must be all I could utter, compared with what the least reflection must  make you feel! Your uncle, in a broken state of health, is sent abroad; your  mother, though too justly incensed to see you, sacrifices her happiness to  serve you!'  Lionel, for a few hours, was in despair after this harangue; but as they passed  away, he strove to drive it from his mind, persuading himself it was useless to  dwell upon what was irretrievable.  Mrs. Arlbery, the following day, made her visit at Etherington, and invited the  two sisters to a breakfast she was to give the next morning. Mr. Tyrold, who  with surprize and concern at a coldness so dilatory, found a second day wearing  away without a visit from Mandlebert, gladly consented to allow of an  amusement, that might shake from Camilla the pensiveness into which, at times,  he saw her falling.  Mrs. Arlbery had declared she hated ceremony in the summer; guarded, therefore,  by Lionel, the sisters walked to the Grove. From the little hill they had again  to pass, they observed a group of company upon the leads of her house, which  were flat, and balustraded round; and when they presented themselves at the  door, they were met by Major Cerwood, who conducted them to the scene of  business.  It was the end of July, and the weather was sultry; but though the height of  the place upon which the present party was collected, gave some freshness to  the air, the heat reflected from the lead would have been nearly intolerable,  had it not been obviated by an awning, and by matts, in the part where seats  and refreshments were arranged. French horns and clarinets were played during  the repast.  This little entertainment had for motive a young lady's quitting her boarding  school. Miss Dennel, a niece, by marriage, of Mrs. Arlbery, who, at the age of  fourteen, came to preside at the house and table of her father, had begged to  be felicitated by her aunt, upon the joyful occasion, with a ball: but Mrs.  Arlbery declared she never gave any entertainments in which she did not expect  to play the principal part herself; and that balls and concerts were therefore  excluded from her list of home diversions. It was vastly well to see others  shine superior, she said, elsewhere, but she could not be so accommodating as  to perform Nobody under her own roof. She offered her, however, a breakfast,  with full choice of its cakes and refreshments; which, with leave to fix upon  the spot where it should be given, was all the youthful pleader could obtain.  The Etherington trio met with a reception the most polite, and Camilla was  distinguished by marks of peculiar favour. Few guests were added to the party  she had met there before, except the young lady who was its present foundress;  and whose voice she recollected to have heard, in the enquiries which had  reached her ear from within the paddock.  Miss Dennel was a pretty, blooming, tall girl, but as childish in intellect as  in experience; though self-persuaded she was a woman in both, since she was  called from school to sit at the head of her father's table.  Camilla required nothing further for entertainment than to listen to her new  friend; Lavinia, though more amazed than amused, always modestly hung back as a  mere looker on; and the company in general made their diversion from viewing,  through various glasses, the seats of the neighbouring gentlemen, and  reviewing, with yet more scrutiny, their characters and circumstances. But  Lionel, ever restless, seized the opportunity to patrol the attic regions of  the house, where, meeting with a capacious lumber room, he returned to assure  the whole party it would make an admirable theatre, and to ask who would come  forth to spout with him.  Mr. Macdersey said, he did not know one word of any part, but he could never  refuse anything that might contribute to the company's pleasure.  Away they sped together, and in a few minutes reversed the face of everything.  Old sofas, bedsteads, and trunks, large family chests, deal boxes and hampers,  carpets and curtains rolled up for the summer, tables with two legs, and chairs  without bottoms, were truckled from the middle to one end of the room, and  arranged to form a semi-circle, with seats in front, for a pit. Carpets were  then uncovered and untied, to be spread for the stage, and curtains, with as  little mercy, were unfurled, and hung up to make a scene.  They then applied to Miss Dennel, who had followed to peep at what they were  about, and asked if she thought the audience might be admitted.  She declared she had never seen any place so neat and elegant in her life.  Such an opinion could not but be decisive; and they prepared to re-ascend; when  the sight of a small door, near the entrance of the large apartment, excited  the ever ready curiosity of Lionel, who, though the key was on the outside,  contrived to turn it wrong; but while endeavouring to rectify by force what he  had spoilt by aukwardness, a sudden noise from within startled them all, and  occasioned quick and reiterated screams from Miss Dennel, who, with the utmost  velocity burst back upon the company on the leads, calling out; 'O Lord! how  glad I am I'm coming back alive! Mr. Macdersey and young Mr. Tyrold are very  likely killed! for they've just found I don't know how many robbers shut up in  a dark closet!'  The gentlemen waited for no explanation to this unintelligible story, but  hastened to the spot; and Mrs. Arlbery ordered all the servants who were in  waiting to follow and assist.  Miss Dennel then entreated to have the trap door through which they ascended,  from a small staircase, to the leads, double locked till the gentlemen should  declare upon their honours that the thieves were all dead.  Mrs. Arlbery would not listen to this, but waited with Lavinia and Camilla the  event.  The gentlemen, meanwhile, reached the scene of action, at the moment when  Macdersey, striking first his foot, and then his whole person against the door,  had forced it open with such sudden violence, that he fell over a pail of water  into the adjoining room.  The servants arriving at the same time, announced that this was merely a closet  for mops, brooms, and pails, belonging to the housemaid: and it appeared, upon  examination, that the noise from within, had simply been produced by the  falling down of a broom, occasioned by their shaking the door in endeavouring  to force the lock.  The Ensign, wetted or splashed all over, was in a fury; and, turning to Lionel,  who laughed vociferously, whilst the rest of the gentlemen were scarce less  moderate, and the servants joined in the chorus, peremptorily demanded to know  if he had put the pail there on purpose; 'In which case, sir,' said he, 'you  must never let me see you laugh again to the longest hour you have to live!'  'My good Macdersey,' said the General, 'go into another room, and have your  cloaths wiped and dried; it will be time enough then to settle who shall laugh  longest.'  'General,' said he, 'I scorn to mind being either wet or dry; a soldier ought  to be above such delicate effeminacy: it is not, therefore, the sousing I  regard, provided I can once be clear it was not done for a joke.'  Lionel, when he could speak, declared, that far from placing the pail there on  purpose, he had not known there was such a closet in the house, nor had ever  been up those stairs till they all mounted them together.  'I am perfectly satisfied, then, my good friend,' said the Ensign, shaking him  by the hand with an heartiness that gave him no small share of the pail's  contents; 'when a gentleman tells me a thing seriously, I make it a point to  believe him; especially if he has a good honest countenance, that assures me he  would not refuse me satisfaction, in the case he had meant to make game of me.'  'And do you always terminate your jests with the ceremony of a tilting match?'  cried Sir Sedley.  'Yes, Sir! if I'm made a joke of by a man of any honour. For, to tell you a  piece of my mind, there's no one thing upon earth I hate like a joke; unless  it's against another person; and then it only gives me a little joy inwardly;  for I make it a point of complaisance not to laugh out: except where I happen  to wish for a little private conversation with the person that gives me the  diversion.'  'Facetious in the extreme!' cried Sir Sedley, 'an infallibly excellent mode to  make a man die of laughter? Droll to the utmost!'  'With regard to that, Sir, I have no objection to a little wit or humour,  provided a person has the politeness to laugh only at himself, and his own  particular friends and relations; but if once he takes the liberty to turn me  into ridicule, I look upon it as an affront, and expect the proper reparation.'  'O, to refuse that would be without bowels to a degree!'  Lionel now ran up stairs, to beg the ladies would come and see the theatre; but  suddenly exclaimed, as he looked around, 'Ah ha!' and hastily galloped down,  and to the bottom of the house. Mrs. Arlbery descended with her young party,  and the Ensign, in mock heroics, solemnly prostrated himself to Miss Dennel,  pouring into her delighted ears, from various shreds and scraps of different  tragedies, the most high flown and egregiously ill-adapted complements: while  the Major, less absurdly, though scarce less passionately, made Camilla his  Juliet, and whispered the tenderest lines of Romeo.  Lionel presently running, out of breath, up stairs again, cried: 'Mrs. Arlbery,  I have drawn you in a new beau.'  'Have you?' cried she, coolly; 'why then I permit you to draw him out again.  Had you told me he had forced himself in, you had made him welcome. But I  foster only willing slaves. So off, if you please, with your boast and your  beau.'  'I can't, upon my word, ma'am, for he is at my heels.'  Mandlebert, at the same moment, not hearing what passed, made his appearance.  The surprised and always unguarded Camilla, uttered an involuntary exclamation,  which instantly catching his ear, drew his eye towards the exclaimer, and there  fixed it; with an astonishment which suspended wholly his half made bow, and  beginning address to Mrs. Arlbery.  Lionel had descried him upon the little hill before the house; where, as he was  passing on, his own attention had been caught by the sound of horns and  clarinets, just as, without any explanation, Lionel flew to tell him he was  wanted, and almost forced him off his horse, and up the stairs.  Mrs. Arlbery, in common with those who dispense with all forms for themselves,  exacted them punctiliously from all others. The visit therefore of Mandlebert  not being designed for her, afforded her at first no gratification, and  produced rather a contrary feeling, when she observed the total absence of all  pleasure in the surprise with which he met Camilla at her house. She gave him a  reception of cold civility, and then chatted almost wholly with the General, or  Sir Sedley.  Edgar scarce saw whether he was received or not; his bow was mechanical, his  apology for his intrusion was unintelligible. Amazement at seeing Camilla under  this roof, disappointment at her breach of implied promise, and mortification  at the air of being at home, which he thought he remarked in her situation,  though at an acquaintance he had taken so much pains to keep aloof from her,  all conspired to displease and perplex him; and though his eyes could with  difficulty look any other way, he neither spoke to nor approached her.  Nor was even thus meeting her all he had to give him disturbance; the palpable  devoirs of Major Cerwood incensed as well astonished him; for, under pretext of  only following the humour of the day, in affecting to act the hero in love, the  Major assailed her, without reserve, with declarations of his passion, which  though his words passed off as quotations, his looks and manner made  appropriate. How, already, thought Edgar, has he obtained such a privilege?  such confidence? To have uttered one such sentence, my tongue would have  trembled, my lips would have quivered!  Camilla felt confounded by his presence, from the consciousness of the ill  opinion she must excite by this second apparent disregard of a given  engagement. She would fain have explained to him it's history; but she could  not free herself from the Major, whose theatrical effusions were not now to be  repressed, since, at first, she had unthinkingly attended to them.  Lionel joined with Macdersey in directing similar heroics to Miss Dennel, who,  simply enchanted, called out: 'I'm determined when I've a house of my own, I'll  have just such a room as this at the top of it, on purpose to act a play every  night.'  'And when, my dear,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'do you expect to have a house of your  own?'  'O, as soon as I am married, you know.'  'Is your marrying, then, already decided?'  'Dear no, not that I know of, aunt. I'm sure I never trouble myself about it;  only I suppose it will happen some day or other.'  'And when it does, you are very sure your husband will approve your acting  plays every night?'  'O, as to that, I shan't ask him. Whenever I'm married I'll be my own mistress,  that I'm resolved upon. But papa's so monstrous cross, he says he won't let me  act plays now.'  'Papas and mamas,' cried Sir Sedley, 'are ever most egregiously in the way.  'Tis prodigiously surprising they have never yet been banished society. I know  no mark more irrefragable of the supineness of mankind.'  Then rising, and exclaiming: 'What savage heat! I wish the weather had a little  feeling!' he broke up the party by ordering his curricle, and being the first  to depart.  'That creature,' cried Mrs. Arlbery, 'if one had the least care for him, is  exactly an animal to drive one mad! He labours harder to be affected than any  ploughman does for his dinner. And, completely as his conceit obscures it, he  has every endowment nature can bestow, except common sense!'  They now all descended to take leave, except the Ensign and Lionel, who went,  arm in arm, prowling about, to view all the garrets, followed on tip-toe by  Miss Dennel. Lavinia called vainly after her brother; but Camilla, hoping every  instant she might clear her conduct to Edgar, was not sorry to be detained.  They had not, however, been five minutes in the parlour, before a violent and  angry noise from above, induced them all to remount to the top of the house;  and there, upon entering a garret whence it issued, they saw Miss Dennel,  decorated with the Ensign's cocked hat and feather, yet looking pale with  fright; Lionel accoutred in the maid's cloaths, and almost in a convulsion of  laughter; and Macdersey, in a rage utterly incomprehensible, with the  coachman's large bob-wig hanging loose upon his head.  It was sometime before it was possible to gather, that having all paraded into  various garrets, in search of adventures, Lionel, after attiring himself in the  maid's gown, cap, and apron, had suddenly deposited upon Miss Dennel's head the  Ensign's cocked hat, replacing it with the coachman's best wig upon the toupee  of Macdersey; whose resentment was so violent at this liberty, that it was  still some minutes before he could give it articulation.  The effect of this full buckled bob-jerom which stuck hollow from the young  face and powdered locks of the Ensign, was irresistibly ludicrous; yet he would  have deemed it a greater indignity to take it quietly off, than to be viewed in  it by thousands; though when he saw the disposition of the whole company to  sympathise with Lionel, his wrath rose yet higher, and stamping with passion,  he fiercely said to him—'Take it off, sir!—take it off my head!'  Lionel, holding this too imperious a command to be obeyed, only shouted louder.  Macdersey then, incensed beyond endurance, lowered his voice with stifled  choler, and putting his arms a-kimbo, said—'If you take me for a fool, sir, I  shall demand satisfaction; for it's what I never put up with!'  Then, turning to the rest, he solemnly added—'I beg pardon of all the worthy  company for speaking this little whisper, which certainly I should scorn to do  before ladies, if it had not been a secret.'  Mrs. Arlbery, alarmed at the serious consequences now threatening this folly,  said—'No, no; I allow of no secrets in my house, but what are entrusted to  myself. I insist, therefore, upon being umpire in this cause.'  'Madam,' said Macdersey, 'I hope never to become such a debased brute of the  creation, as to contradict the commands of a fair lady: except when it's upon a  point of honour. But I can't consent to pass for a fool; and still more not for  a poltroon—You'll excuse the little hint.'  Then, while making a profound and ceremonious bow, his wig fell over his head  on the ground.  'This is very unlucky,' cried he, with a look of vexation; 'for certainly, and  to be sure no human mortal should have made me take it off myself, before I was  righted.'  Camilla, picking it up, to render the affair merely burlesque, pulled off the  maid's cap from her brother's head, and put on the wig in its place,  saying—'There, Lionel, you have played the part of Lady Wrong Head long  enough; be so good now as to perform that of Sir Francis.'  This ended the business, and the whole party, in curricles, on horseback, or on  foot, departed from the Grove.  BOOK IV
