 Means to obtain a Boon  Mr. Tyrold was soon, by urgent claims, forced to leave them; and Camilla, with  strong secret anxiety to know if Edgar had caused this blest meeting, led to a  general explanation upon past events.  And now, to her utter amazement, she found that her letter sent by the labourer  had never been received.  Mrs. Tyrold related, that she had no sooner read the first letter addressed to  her through Lavinia, than, softened and affected, she wrote an answer of the  utmost kindness to Belfont; desiring Camilla to continue with her sister till  called for by Miss Margland, in her return home from Mrs. Macdersey. The visit,  meanwhile to Cleves, had transpired through Jacob, and, much touched by, yet  much blaming her travelling thus alone, she wrote to her a second time,  charging her to remove no more from Belfont without Miss Margland. But, on the  preceding morning, the first letter had been returned with a note from Eugenia,  that her sister had set out two days before for Etherington.  The moment of this intelligence, was the most dreadful to Mr. Tyrold and  herself of their lives. Every species of conjecture was horrible. He set out  instantly for Belfont, determining to make enquiries at every inn, house, and  cottage, by the way; but by taking, unfortunately, the road through Alton, he  had missed the half-way-house. In the evening, while, with apprehensions  surpassing all description, she was waiting some news, a chaise drove up to the  door. She flew out, but saw in it ... alone, cold, trembling, and scarce in her  senses, Eugenia. Instantly imagining she came with tidings of fatal tendency  concerning Camilla, she started back, exclaiming, 'All, then, is over?' The  chaise-door had been opened; but Eugenia, shaking too violently to get out;  only, and faintly, answered, 'Yes! my Mother ... all is over!—' The mistake  was almost instantaneous death to her—though the next words of Eugenia  cleared it up, and led to her own dreadful narrative.  Bellamy, as soon as Camilla had left Belfont, had made a peremptory demand that  his wife should claim, as if for some purpose of her own, a large sum of Sir  Hugh. Her steady resistance sent him from the house in a rage; and she saw no  more of him till that day at noon, when he returned in deeper, blacker wrath  than she had ever yet seen; and vowed that nothing less than her going in  person to her uncle with his request, should induce him ever to forgive her.  When he found her resolute in refusal, he ordered a chaise, and made her get  into it, without saying for what purpose. She saw they were travelling towards  Cleves, but he did not once speak, except where they changed horses, till they  came upon the cross-road, leading to the half-way-house. Suddenly then, bidding  the postillion stop at the end of a lane, he told him he was going to look at a  little farm, and, ordering him to wait, made her alight and walk down it till  they were out of sight of the man and the carriage. Fiercely, then stopping  short, 'Will you give me,' he cried, 'your promise, upon oath, that you will  ask your Uncle for the money?' 'Indeed, Mr. Bellamy, I cannot!' she answered.  'Enough!' he cried, and took from his pocket a pistol. 'Good Heaven,' she said,  'you will not murder me?'—'I cannot live without the money myself,' he  answered, 'and why should I let you?' He then felt in his waistcoat pocket,  whence he took two bullets, telling her, she should have the pleasure of seeing  him load the pistol; and that when one bullet had dispatched her, the other  should disappoint the executioner. Horrour now conquered her, and she solemnly  promised to ask whatever he dictated. 'I must hold the pistol to your ear,'  cried he, 'while you take your oath. See! 'tis loaded—This is no child's  play.' He then lifted it up; but, at the same moment, a distant voice  exclaimed, 'Hold, villain! or you are a dead man!' Starting, and meaning to  hide it within his waistcoat, his hand shook—the pistol went off—it shot  him through the body, and he dropt down dead. Without sense or motion, she fell  by his side; and, upon recovering, found herself again in the chaise. The  postillion, who knew her, had carried her thither, and brought her on to  Etherington. She then conjured that proper persons might go back with the  driver, and that her Father would have the benevolence to superintend all that  could be done that would be most respectfully decent.  The postillion acknowledged that it was himself who had cried, 'Hold, villain!  A suspicion of some mischief had occurred to him, from seeing the end of a  pistol jerk from the pocket of the gentleman, as he got out of the chaise; and  begging a man, who accidentally passed while he waited, to watch his horses, he  ran down a field by the side of the lane, whence he heard the words: 'The  pistol is loaded, and for no child's play!' upon which, seeing it raised, and  the young Lady shrink, he called out. Yet Eugenia protested herself convinced  that Bellamy had no real design against either his own life or her's, though  terrour, at the moment, had conquered her: he had meant but to affright her  into consent, knowing well her word once given, with whatever violence torn  from her, would be held sacred. The rest was dreadful accident, or Providence  in that form playing upon himself his own toils. The pious young Widow was so  miserable at this shocking exit, and the shocking manner in which the remains  were left exposed, that her Mother had set out herself to give orders in  person, from the half-way-house, for bringing thither the body, till Mr. Tyrold  could give his own directions. She found, however, that business already done.  The man called by the postillion had been joined by a party of labourers, just  leaving off work; those had gathered others; they had procured some broad  planks which served for a bier, and had humanely conveyed the body to the inn,  where the landlord was assured the postillion would come back with some account  of him, though little Peggy had only learnt in general that he had been found  murdered near a wood.  'Eugenia is just now,' said Mrs. Tyrold, in conclusion, 'plunged into an abyss  of ideas, frightful to her humanity, and oppressive to the tenderness of her  heart. Her nature is too noble to rejoice in a release to herself, worked by  means so horrible, and big with notions of retribution for the wretched  culprit, at which even vengeance the most implacable might shudder.  Nevertheless, all will imperceptibly pass away, save the pity inherent in all  good minds for vice and its penalties. To know his abrupt punishment, and not  to be shocked, would be inhuman; but to grieve with any regard for a man of  such principles and conduct, would be an outrage to all that they have injured  and offended.'  This view of the transaction, by better reconciling Camilla to the ultimate lot  of her sister, brought her back to reflect upon her own. Still she had not  gathered with precision how she had been discovered. To pronounce the name of  Edgar was impossible; but after a long pause, which Mrs. Tyrold had hoped was  given again to repose, she ventured to say, 'I have not yet heard, my dearest  Mother, to what benign chance I immediately owe my present unspeakable,  unmerited happiness?'  Mrs. Tyrold looked at her a moment in silence, as if to read what her question  offered beyond its mere words: but she saw her eye hastily withdrawn from the  examination, and her cheeks suddenly enveloped with the bed cloaths.  Quietly, and without turning towards her again, she resumed her narrative.  'I engaged the worthy postillion of my poor Eugenia to drive me, purposing to  send Ambrose on with him, while I waited at the half-way-house: but, about two  miles off, Ambrose, who rode before, was stopt by a gentleman, whom he met in a  post chaise; when I came up to him, I stopt also. It was Mr. Mandlebert.'  Camilla, who had looked up, now again hastily drew back, and Mrs. Tyrold, after  a short pause, went on.  'His intelligence, of course, finished my search. My first idea was to convey  you instantly home; but the particulars I gathered made me fear removing you.  When I entered your room, you were asleep;—I dreaded to surprise yet could  not refrain taking a view of you, and while I looked, you suddenly awoke.'  Ah! thought Camilla, 'tis to Edgar, then, that ultimately I owe this blest  moment!  'But my Father,' she cried, 'my dearest Mother,—how came my dear Father to  know where you had found me?'  'At Belfont he learnt the way you had set out, and that Eugenia and Bellamy  were from home; and, without loss of time ... regardless of the night and of  fasting, ... he returned by a route through which he traced you at every inn  where you had changed horses. He, also, entered as you were sleeping—and we  watched together by your side.'  Again filial gratitude silenced all but itself, and sleep, the softest she had  known for many months, soon gave to oblivion every care in Camilla.  The changeful tide of mental spirits from misery to enjoyment, is not more  rapid than the transition from personal danger to safety, in the elastic period  of youth. 'Tis the epoch of extremes; and moderation, by which alone we learn  the true use of our blessings, is a wisdom we are frequently only taught to  appreciate when redundance no longer requires its practice.  Camilla, from sorrow the most desolate, bounded to joy that refused a  solicitude; and from an illness that held her suspended between delirium and  dissolution, to ease that had no complaint. The sufferings which had deprived  her of the benefit of rest and nourishment were no sooner removed, than she  appeared to be at once restored to health; though to repair the wastes of  strength some time yet was necessary.  Mrs. Tyrold determined to carry her this afternoon to Etherington. The remains  of the wretched Bellamy, in a coffin and hearse brought from Winchester, had  been sent to Belfont in the morning: and Mr. Tyrold had followed, to give every  direction that he should be buried as the master of the house; without  reference to the conduct which had forfeited all such respect.  Though the evil committed by the non-deliverance of Camilla's letter was now  past all remedy, Mrs. Tyrold thought it every way right to endeavour to  discover where [lay] the blame: and by the two usual modes of menace and  promises, she learnt that the countryman, when he stopt to drink by the way,  had, in lighting his pipe, let the letter take fire; and fearing to lose the  recompense he had expected, had set his conscience apart for a crown, and  returned with the eventful falsehood, which had made Camilla think herself  abandoned, and her friends deplore her as lost.  For the benefit of those with whom, in future, he might have to deal, Mrs.  Tyrold took some pains to represent to him the cruel evils his dishonesty had  produced; but, stupid rather than wicked, what he had done had been without  weighing right from wrong, and what he heard was without understanding it.  Camilla found, with extreme satisfaction, that Mrs. Tyrold, notwithstanding the  strictness of the present family œconomy, meant liberally to recompense Mrs.  Marl, for the trouble and patience with which she had attended to a guest so  little profitable: while Peggy, to whose grateful remembrance she owed the  consideration she had met with in her deserted condition, was rewarded by a  much larger sum than she had ever before possessed. Camilla was obliged to  confess she had parted with two pledges for future payment: the watch was  reclaimed without difficulty; but she shewed so much distress in naming the  locket, that Mrs. Tyrold, though she looked anxiously surprised, demanded it  without enquiring into its history.  The excess of delight to Camilla in preparing to return to Etherington,  rendered her insensible to all fatigue, till she was descending the stairs;  when the recollection of the shock she had received from the corpse of Bellamy,  made her tremble so exceedingly, that she could scarce walk past the door of  the room in which it had been laid. 'Ah, my dearest Mother,' she cried, 'this  house must give me always the most penetrating sensations: I have experienced  in it the deepest grief, and the most heart-soothing enjoyment that ever,  perhaps, gave place one to the other in so short a time!'  Ambrose had announced their intended arrival, and at the door of the house, the  timid, but affectionate Lavinia was waiting to receive them; and as Camilla, in  alighting, met her tender embraces, a well-known voice reached her ears,  calling out in hurried accents, 'Where is she? Is she come indeed? Are you  quite sure?' And Sir Hugh, hobbling rather than walking into the hall, folded  her in his feeble arms, sobbing over her: 'I can't believe it for joy! Poor  sinner that I am, and the cause of all our bad doings! how can I have deserved  such a thing as this, to have my own little Girl come back to me? which could  not have made my heart gladder, if I had had no share in all this bad mischief!  which, God knows I've had enough, owing to my poor head doing always for the  worst, for all my being the oldest of us all; which is a thing I've often  thought remarkable enough, in the point of my knowing no better; which however,  I hope my dear little Darling will excuse for the sake of my love, which is  never happy but in seeing her.'  The heart of Camilla bounded with grateful joy at sight of this dear Uncle, and  at so tender a reception: and while with equal emotion, and equal weakness,  they were unable to support either each other or themselves, the worthy old  Jacob, his eyes running over, came to help his Master back to the parlour, and  Mrs. Tyrold and Lavinia conveyed thither Camilla: who was but just placed upon  a sofa, by the side of her fond Uncle, when the door of an inner apartment was  softly opened, and pale, wan, and meagre, Eugenia appeared at it, saying, as  faintly, yet with open arms, she advanced to Camilla: 'Let me too—your poor  harassed, and but half-alive Eugenia, make one in this precious scene! Let me  see the joy of my kind Uncle—the revival of my honoured Mother, the happiness  of my dear Lavinia—and feel even my own heart beat once more with delight in  the bosom of its darling Sister!... my so mourned—but now for ever, I trust,  restored to me, most dear Camilla!'  Camilla, thus encircled in her Mother's, Uncle's, Sister's, arms at once,  gasped, sighed, smiled, and shed tears in the same grateful minute, while  fondly she strove to articulate, 'Am I again at Etherington and at Cleves in  one? And thus indulgently received? thus more than forgiven? My heart wants  room for its joy! my Mother! my Sisters! if you knew what despair has been my  portion! I feared even the sight of my dear Uncle himself, lest the sorrows and  the errours of a creature he so kindly loved, should have demolished his  generous heart!'  'Mine, my dearest little Girl?' cried the Baronet, 'why what would that have  signified, in comparison to such a young one as yours, that ought to know no  sorrow yet a while? God knows, it being time enough to begin: for it is but  melancholy at best, the cares of the world; which if you can't keep off now,  will be overtaking you at every turn.'  Mrs. Tyrold entreated Camilla might be spared further conversation. Eugenia had  already glided back to her chamber, and begged, this one solacing interview  over, to be dispensed with from joining the family at present; Camilla was  removed also to her chamber; and the tender Mother divided her time and her  cares between these two recovered treasures of her fondest affection.
