 An Author's Time-keeper  Mr. Westwyn, charmed to meet so many near relations of a long-valued friend,  struck by the extraordinary beauty of Indiana, and by the sensible answers of  the child, as Mr. Westwyn called Eugenia; as well as caught by the united loveliness of  person and of mind which Mr. Westwyn observed in Camilla, could not bring Mr. Westwyn to  retire till the dinner was upon the table: pleading, in excuse for Mr. Westwyn stay,  Mr. Westwyn former intimacy with Sir Hugh.
Miss Margland, seeing in Mr. Westwyn nothing that  marked fashion, strove to distance Mr. Westwyn by a high demeanour: but though not  wanting in shrewdness, Mr. Westwyn was a perfectly natural man, and only  thinking her manners disagreeable, without suspecting her intention, took but  little notice of her, from the time Mr. Westwyn saw her could give Mr. Westwyn no pleasure:  while with the young party, Mr. Westwyn was so much delighted, that Mr. Westwyn seriously  regretted Mr. Westwyn had only one son to offer amongst the young party.
When the dinner was served, her grew uneasy that Dr. Orkborne should be  summoned, whose non-appearance her had not ventured to mention, from the  professed hatred of Mr. Westwyn very sight avowed by Miss Margland.
But Camilla,  brought up to exert constantly her courage for the absent, told the waiter to  call the gentleman from the head of the stairs.
'My master himself, ma'am,' My master himself answered, 'as well as me, both told the  gentleman the company My master himself came with were served; but My master himself as good as bid us both  hold us tongues.
My master himself seems to have taken a great liking to that place upon the  stairs; though there's nothing I know of particular in it.'
'But, if you tell My master himself us wait dinnerâ€”' cried her; when Miss Margland,  interrupting Miss Margland said, 'I'm sure, then, you won't tell My master himself true: for I beg us  may all begin.
I think it would be rather more decorous My master himself should wait for us!'
the waiter, nevertheless, went; but presently returned, somewhat ruffled;  saying, 'The gentleman does not choose to hear me, ma'am.
the waiter says, if the waiter mayn't  be let alone one single minute, it will be throwing away all the waiter morning.
I  can't say I know what the waiter means; but the waiter speaks rather froppish.
I'd as lieve not  go to the waiter again, if you please.'
Miss Margland declared, Miss Margland wished the waiter no better dinner than the waiter pot-hooks; but  did not doubt the waiter would come just before they had done, as usual; and the waiter was no  more mentioned: though Miss Margland never in Miss Margland life eat so fast; and the table was  ordered to be cleared of the table covers, with a speed exactly the reverse of the  patience with which the Doctor was indulged on similar occasions by the baronet.
Miss Margland, when the cloth was removed, proposed a sally in search of  lodgings.
Camilla and Eugenia, desirous of a private conference, begged to  remain within; though the latter sought to take care of Camilla absent preceptor,  before Camilla could enjoy the conversation of Camilla sister; and when Miss Margland  and Indiana, in secret exultation at his dinnerless state, had glided, with  silent simpering, past his, flew to beseech his consent to take some  nourishment.
Such, however, was his present absorption in what his was writing, that the  voluntary kindness of his pupil was as unwelcome as the forced intrusion of the  waiter; and his conjured the  waiter to grant his a little respite from such eternal  tormenting, with the plaintive impatience of deprecating some injury.
The sisters, now, equally eager to relate and to listen to The sisters mutual  affairs, shut The sisters up in the apartment of Eugenia; who, with the greatest  simplicity, began the discourse, by saying, 'Have you heard, my dear sister,  that Clermont has refused me?'
Camilla was severely shocked.
Accustomed Camilla to the face and form of  Eugenia, which, to Camilla innocent affection, presented always the image of Camilla  virtuous mind and cultivated understanding, Camilla had not presaged even the  possibility of such an event; and, though Camilla had seen with concern the  inequality of their outward appearance, Clermont had seemed to Camilla, in all  else, so inferior to Camilla sister, that Camilla had repined at his unworthiness, but  never doubted the alliance.
Camilla was distressed how to offer any consolation; but soon found none was  required.
Camilla was composed and contented, though pensive, and not without  some feeling of mortification.
Yet anger and resentment had found no place in  the transaction.
Camilla equity acknowledged that Clermont had every right of  choice: but while Camilla candour induced her candour to even applaud her candour disinterestedness  in relinquishing the Cleves estate, her candour capacity pointed out how terrible must  be the personal defects, that so speedily, without one word of conversation,  one trial of any sort how their tastes, tempers, or characters might accord,  stimulated her candour to so decisive a rejection.
This view of her candour unfortunate  appearance cast her candour, at first, into a train of melancholy ideas, that would  fast have led her candour to unhappiness, though wholly unmixed with any regret of  Clermont, had not the natural philosophy of her candour mind come to her candour aid; or had  her candour education been of a more worldly sort.
When Camilla related Camilla own history, Camilla plan of making Edgar again completely  master of Edgar own proceedings met the entire approbation of Eugenia, who, with  a serious smile, said, 'Take warning by me, my dear sister!
and, little as you  have reason to be brought into any comparison with such a one as me, anticipate  the disgrace of defection!'
Camilla, much touched, embraced my dear sister, sincerely wishing my dear sister were half as  faultless as my dear sister excellent self.
The return of Miss Margland and Indiana obliged The return of Miss Margland and Indiana to quit The return of Miss Margland and Indiana retreat; and  The return of Miss Margland and Indiana now found Dr. Orkborne in the dining-room.
Having finished Dr. Orkborne paragraph,  Dr. Orkborne had sought Dr. Orkborne party of Dr. Orkborne own accord; but, meeting with no one, had taken  a book from Dr. Orkborne pocket, with which Dr. Orkborne meant to beguile the appetite Dr. Orkborne felt  rising, till the hour of dinner, which Dr. Orkborne had not the smallest suspicion was  over; for of the progress of time Dr. Orkborne had no knowledge but by no knowledge palpable  passage from the sun to the moon; Dr. Orkborne watch was never wound up, and the morning  and the evening were but announced to Dr. Orkborne by a summons to breakfast and to  supper.
The ladies seated The ladies at the window.
Indiana was enchanted by the  concourse of gay and well-dressed people passing by, and far from insensible to  the visible surprise and pleasure she excited in those who cast up their eyes  at the hotel.
Eugenia, to whom a great and populous town was entirely new,  found also, in the diversity as well as novelty of as well objects, much matter for  remark and contemplation; Miss Margland experienced the utmost satisfaction in  seeing, at last, some faces and some things less rustic than had been presented  to Miss Margland in Yorkshire or at Cleves; and Camilla had every hope that this place,  in Edgar's own expression, would terminate every perplexity, and give local  date to Camilla life's permanent felicity.
In a few minutes, a youth appeared on the opposite pavement, whose air was new  to none of the party, yet not immediately recollected by any.
It was striking,  however, in elegance and in melancholy.
Eugenia recollected him first, and  starting back, gasped for breath; Indiana the next moment called out, 'Ah!...
it's Mr.
Melmond!'
and blushing high, Eugenia whole face was bright and dimpled  with unexpected delight.
him walked on, without looking up, and Indiana, simply piqued as well as  chagrined, said Eugenia was glad him was gone.
But Eugenia looked after him with a gentle sigh, which now first Eugenia thought  blameless, and a pleasure, which, though half mournful, Eugenia now suffered  Eugenia to encourage.
Free from all ties that made Eugenia shun this partiality as  culpable, Eugenia secretly told Eugenia Eugenia might now, without injury to any one,  indulge it for an object [whom,] little as he was known to Eugenia, Eugenia internally  painted with all the faultless qualities of ideal excellence.
From these meditations Eugenia was roused by Dr. Orkborne's looking rather  wishfully round him, and exclaiming, 'Pray ... don't we dine rather late?'
The mistake being cleared up, by Miss Margland's assuring him it was impossible  to keep dinner waiting all day, for people who chose to stand whole hours upon  a staircase, him felt rather discomforted: but when Eugenia privately ordered  him a repast in him own chamber, him was amply consoled, by the unconstrained  freedom with which him was empowered to have more books upon the table than  plates; and to make more ink spots than him eat mouthfuls.
Camilla had the mortification to find, upon Camilla return home, that Edgar had  made Edgar promised visit, not only in Camilla absence, but while Mrs. Berlinton was  still with Mrs. Berlinton aunt.
Camilla then communicated to Camilla the secret to which, while yet in  ignorance of Camilla existence, Camilla now found Camilla had been sacrificed.
Mrs. Ecton,  two years ago, had given Camilla hand, in the most solemn privacy, to Camilla butler,  who now attended Camilla to Southampton.
To avoid disobliging a sick old relation,  from whom Camilla expected a considerable legacy, Camilla had prevailed with Camilla  husband to consent that the marriage should not be divulged: but certain that  whatever now might be Camilla fortune, Camilla had no power to bequeath it from Camilla new  connexion, the terror of leaving utterly destitute a beautiful young creature,  who believed Camilla well provided for, had induced Camilla to nearly force Camilla  acceptance of an almost superannuated old man of family; who, merely coveting  Camilla beauty, inquired not into Camilla inclination.
The same latent cause had made  Camilla inexorable to the pleadings of young Melmond; who, conceiving his fortune  dependent upon the pleasure of his aunt, his certain income being trifling,  thought it his duty to fly the fair object of his adoration, when his discovered  the deceit of Lionel with regard to the inheritance of Sir Hugh.
This sick old  relation was now just dead, and had left to her sole disposal a considerable  estate.
her  husband naturally refused to be kept any longer from her  husband just  rights; but the shame her felt of making the discovery of a marriage contracted  clandestinely, after her was sixty years of age, with a man under thirty, threw  her into a nervous fever.
And, in his dinnerless state, unable to reveal to her nephew an  event which now affected her nephew alone, her prevailed with Mr. Ulst, who was  willing to revisit her nephew original home, Southampton, to accompany her thither in  her nephew usual capacity, till her had summoned her nephew and niece, and acquainted  her nephew and niece with the affair.
To her, Mrs. Berlinton said, the evil of this transaction had been over,  while yet it was unknown; Mrs. Berlinton had heard this transaction, therefore, in silence, and forborne  unavailing reproach.
But Mrs. Berlinton brother, to whom the blow was new, and the  consequences were still impending, was struck with extreme anguish, that while  thus every possible hope was extinguished with regard to   love,   must  suddenly apply   to some business, or be reduced to the most obscure  poverty.
Camilla heard the account with sincere concern for them both, much heightened  for young Melmond, upon finding that, by   express desire,   sister now  relinquished his sister design of cultivating an acquaintance with Indiana, whom    had the virtue to determine to avoid, since   fortune, and even   hopes,  were thus irretrievably ruined.
They conversed together to a late hour; and Camilla, before They parted, made  the most earnest apologies for the liberty taken with Camilla house by Mrs. Mittin:  but Mrs. Berlinton, with the utmost sweetness, begged Camilla might stay till all  Camilla business with Camilla was settled; smilingly adding, business alone, Camilla was  sure could bring business alone together.
Much relieved, Camilla then determined to press Mrs. Mittin to collect and pay Camilla  accounts immediately; and to avoid with Camilla, in the meanwhile, any further  transactions.
