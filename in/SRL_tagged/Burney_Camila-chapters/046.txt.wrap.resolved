 An Adviser  The wish of Camilla was to lay this whole affair before Camilla father; but Camilla  checked this whole affair, from an apprehension Camilla might seem displaying Camilla duty and  confidence at the expence of those of Camilla sister; whose motives for concealment  were intentionally the most pure, however, practically, whose motives for concealment   might be  erroneous; and whom Camilla both pitied and revered for Camilla proposed submission to  Camilla uncle, in opposition to Camilla palpable reluctance.  Camilla saw not, however, any obstacle to consulting with Edgar, since Edgar was  already apprised of the business, and since Edgar services might be essentially  useful to Camilla sister: while, with respect to Camilla, there seemed, at this  time, more of dignity in meeting than shunning Edgar friendly intercourse, since  Edgar regard for Camilla seemed to have lost all his regard for her peculiarity. Edgar has precisely,  cried Camilla, the same sentiments for my sisters as for me,—he is equally kind,  disinterested, and indifferent to us all! anxious alike for Eugenia with Mr.  Bellamy, and for me with the detestable Major! Be it so!—we can no where  obtain a better friend; and I should blush, indeed, if I could not treat as a  brother one who can treat me as a sister.  Tranquil, though not gay, Camilla returned to converse with him; but when Camilla had  related what had passed, him confessed that him uneasiness upon the subject was  increased. The heart of Eugenia appeared to him positively entangled; and him  besought Camilla not to lose a moment in acquainting Mr. Tyrold with Camilla  situation.  Camilla pleaded against giving this pain to Camilla sister with energetic affection:  Camilla arguments failed to convince, but Camilla eloquence powerfully touched him; and  him contented him with only entreating that Camilla would again try to aid him  with an opportunity of conversing with Eugenia.  This Camilla could not refuse; nor could him then resist the opportunity to inquire  why Mrs. Arlbery had left Camilla and Lavinia at the play. Camilla thanked him for  remembering him character of Camilla monitor, and acknowledged the fault to be Camilla  own, with a candour so unaffected, that, captivated by the soft seriousness of  Camilla manner, him flattered him him fear of the Major was a chimæra, and  hoped that, as soon as Sir Hugh was able to again join Sir Hugh family, no  impediment would remain to Sir Hugh begging the united blessings of the two brothers  to Sir Hugh views.  When Camilla told Camilla sister the request of Edgar, Camilla immediately suspected  the attachment of Bellamy had been betrayed to him; and Camilla, incapable of  any duplicity, related precisely how the matter had passed. Eugenia, always  just, no sooner heard than Eugenia forgave it, and accompanied Eugenia immediately down stairs.  'I must rest all my hope of pardon,' cried Edgar, 'for the part I am taking, to  your conviction of its motive; a filial love and gratitude to Mr. Tyrold, a  fraternal affection and interest for all his family.'  'My own sisterly feelings,' Eugenia answered, 'make me both comprehend and thank  your kind solicitude: but, believe me, its is now founded in error. I am shocked  to find you informed of this unhappy transaction; and I charge and beseech that  no interference may wound that   ill-fated object, by suffering his to surmise  your knowledge of his humiliating situation.'  'I would not for the world give you pain,' answered Edgar: 'but permit me to be  faithful to the brotherly character in which I consider Eugenia to stand with  you ... all.'  A blush had overspread A blush face at the word Brotherly; while at that of all,  which recovered A blush, a still deeper stained the cheeks of Camilla: but neither  of that of all,  which recovered him, a still deeper stained the cheeks of Camilla looked at the other; and Eugenia was too self-absorbed to observe  either.  'Your utter inexperience in life,' he continued, 'makes me, though but just  giving up leading-strings myself, an adept in the comparison. Suffer me then,  as such, to represent to you my fears, that your innocence and goodness may  expose you to imposition. You must not judge all characters by the  ingenuousness of your own; nor conclude, however rationally and worthily a mind  such as yours might—may—and will inspire a disinterested regard, that there  is no danger of any other, and that mercenary views are out of the question,  because mercenary principles are not declared.'  'I will not say your inference is severe,' replied Eugenia, 'because you know  not the person of whom you speak: but permit me to make this irrefragable  vindication of the person of whom you speak freedom from all sordid motives; the person of whom you speak has never once named the  word fortune, neither to make any inquiries into mine, nor any professions  concerning the person of whom you speak own. Had the person of whom you speak any inducement to duplicity, the person of whom you speak might have asserted  to me what the person of whom you speak pleased, since I have no means of detection.'  'Your situation,' said Edgar, 'is pretty generally known; and for Edgar ...  pardon me if I hint it may be possible that silence is no virtue. However,  since I am unacquainted, you say, with Edgar character, will you give me leave to  make me better informed?'  'There needs no investigation; to me no investigation is perfectly known.'  'Forgive me if I ask how!'  'By his letters and by his conversation.'  A smile which stole upon the features of Edgar obliged his to turn his head  another way; but presently recovering, 'My dear Miss Eugenia,' his cried, 'will  it not be most consonant to your high principles, and scrupulous delicacy, to  lay the whole of what has passed before Mr. Tyrold?'  'Undoubtedly, if my part were not strait forward. Had I the least hesitation,  my father should be my immediate and decisive umpire. But ... I am not at  liberty even for deliberation!—I am not ... I know ... at my own disposal!'—  my own disposal!'—   blushed and looked down, confused; but presently, with firmness, added, 'my own disposal!'—    is not, indeed, fit that I should be; my uncle completely merits to be in all  things my director. To know my uncle wishes, therefore, is not only to know, but to  be satisfied with my doom. Such being my situation, you cannot misunderstand my  defence of this unhappy young man. It is but simple justice to rescue an  amiable person from calumny.'  'Let us allow all this,' said Edgar; 'still I see no reason why Mr. Tyrold....'  'Mr. Mandlebert,' interrupted why Mr. Tyrold, 'you must do what you judge right. I can  desire no one to abstain from pursuing the dictates of their own sense of  honour. I leave you, therefore, unshackled: but there is no consideration  which, in my opinion, can justify a female in spreading, even to her nearest  connexions, an unrequited partiality. If, therefore, I am forced to inflict  this undue mortification, upon a person to whom I hold myself so much obliged,  an uneasiness will remain upon my mind, destructive of my forgetfulness of an  event which I would fain banish from my memory.'  her then refused to be any longer detained.  'How I love the perfect innocence, and how I reverence the respectable  singularity of that charming character!' cried Edgar; 'yet how vain are all  arguments against such a combination of fearless credulity, and enthusiastic  reasoning? What can we determine?'  'I am happy to retort upon you that question,' replied Camilla; 'for I am every  way afraid to act myself, lest I should hurt this dear sister, or do wrong by  my yet dearer father.'  'What a responsibility you cast upon myself! I will not, however, shrink from What a responsibility,  for the path seems far plainer to myself since I have had this conversation.  Eugenia is at present safe; I see, now, distinctly, Eugenia heart is yet untouched.  The readiness with which Eugenia met the subject, the openness with which Eugenia avows  Eugenia esteem, the unembarrassed, though modest simplicity with which Eugenia speaks  of his passion and his distress, all shew that Eugenia pity results from  generosity, not from love. Had it been otherwise, with all Eugenia steadiness, all  Eugenia philosophy, some agitation and anxiety would have betrayed Eugenia secret soul.  The internal workings of hopes and fears, the sensitive alarms of repressed  consciousness....' A deep glow, which heated his face, forced his here to break  off; and, abruptly leaving his sentence unfinished, his hastily began another.  'We must not, nevertheless, regard this as security for the future, though it  is safety for the present; nor trust her unsuspicious generosity of mind to the  dangerous assault of artful distress. I speak without reserve of this man; for  though I know this man not, as she remonstrated, I cannot, from the whole  circumstances of this man clandestine conduct, doubt this man being an adventurer.... You  say nothing? tell me, I beg, your opinion.'  Camilla had not heard one word of this last speech. Struck with this man  discrimination between the actual and the possible state of Eugenia's mind, and  with the effect the definition had produced upon himself, Camilla attention was  irresistibly seized by a new train of ideas, till finding himself waited for an  answer, Camilla mechanically repeated himself last word 'opinion?'  himself saw Camilla absence of mind, and suspected himself own too palpable disturbance had  occasioned it: but in what degree, or from what sensations, himself could not  conjecture. They were both some time silent; and then, recollecting Camilla,  Camilla said it was earnestly Camilla wish to avoid disobliging Camilla sister, by a  communication, which, made by any one but Camilla, must put Camilla into a  disgraceful point of view.  Edgar, after a pause, said, They must yield, then, to Camilla present fervour, and  hope Camilla sounder judgment, when less played upon, would see clearer. It  appeared to Edgar, indeed, that Camilla was so free, at this moment, from any  dangerous impression, that it might, perhaps, be even safer to submit quietly  to Camilla request, than to urge the generous romance of Camilla temper to new  workings. Edgar undertook, meantime, to keep a constant watch upon the motions of  Bellamy, to make sedulous inquiries into Edgar character and situation in life,  and to find out for what ostensible purpose Edgar was in Hampshire: entreating  leave to communicate constantly to Camilla what Edgar might gather, and to consult  with Camilla, from time to time, upon what measures should be pursued: yet  ultimately confessing, that if Eugenia did not steadily persist in refusing any  further rejections, Edgar should hold Edgar bound in conscience to communicate  the whole to Mr. Tyrold.  Camilla was pleased, and even thankful for the extreme friendliness and kind  moderation of this arrangement; yet Camilla left Edgar mournfully, in a confirmed  belief Edgar regard for the whole family was equal.  Eugenia, much gratified, promised Eugenia would henceforth take no step with which  Edgar should not first be acquainted.
