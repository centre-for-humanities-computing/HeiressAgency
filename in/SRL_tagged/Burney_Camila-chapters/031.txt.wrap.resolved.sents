 A Few Embarrassments  Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold returned to Etherington somewhat relieved in Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold spirits,  though perplexed in Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold opinions.
Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold had heard from Sir Hugh, that Edgar  had decidedly disavowed any pretensions to Indiana, and had voluntarily  retreated from Cleves, that Edgar   disavowal might risk no misconstruction, either  in the family or the neighbourhood.
This insensibility to beauty the most exquisite wanted no advocate with Mrs.  Tyrold.
Once more Mrs.   conceived some hope of what Mrs.   wished, and Mrs.    determined upon seeing Edgar   before Mrs.   departure.
The displeasure Mrs.   had  nourished against Edgar   vanished, and justice to Edgar   general worth, with an  affection nearly maternal to Edgar   person, took again their wonted place in Mrs.    bosom, and made Mrs.   deem Mrs.   unkind in having purposed to quit the kingdom  without bidding Edgar   farewell.
Mr. Tyrold, whom professional duty and native inclination alike made a man of  peace, was ever happy to second all conciliatory measures, and the first to  propose Mr. Tyrold, whom professional duty and native inclination alike made a man of  peace, where Edgar   voice had any chance of being heard.
Edgar   sent a note,  therefore, to invite Edgar   to call the next morning; and Mrs. Tyrold deferred  Mrs. Tyrold hour of setting off till noon.
Mrs. Tyrold own natural and immediate impulse, had been to carry Camilla with Camilla  abroad; but when Mrs. Tyrold considered that Mrs. Tyrold sole errand was to nurse and appease  an offended sick man, whose chamber Mrs. Tyrold meant not to quit till Mrs. Tyrold returned to  Mrs. Tyrold family, Mrs. Tyrold gave up the pleasure Mrs. Tyrold would Mrs. Tyrold have found in the  scheme, to Mrs. Tyrold fears for the health and spirits of Mrs. Tyrold darling child, joined to  the superior joy of leaving such a solace with Mrs. Tyrold husband.
Sir Hugh had heard the petition for postponing the further visit of Camilla  almost with despondence; but Mr. Tyrold restored Mr. Tyrold completely to confidence,  with respect to Mr. Tyrold doubts concerning Dr. Orkborne, with whom Mr. Tyrold held a long  and satisfactory conversation; and Mr. Tyrold own benevolent heart received a sensible  pleasure, when, upon examining Indiana with regard to Edgar, Mr. Tyrold found Mrs. Tyrold,  though piqued and pouting, untouched either in affection or happiness.
Early the next morning Edgar came.
Mr. Tyrold had taken measures for employing  Camilla upstairs, where Mr. Tyrold did not even hear that Edgar entered the house.
Edgar was received with kindness, and told of the sudden journey, though not of  its motives.
Edgar heard of its with unfeigned concern, and earnestly solicited to  be the companion of the voyage, if no better male protector were appointed.
Mr. Tyrold folded Mr. Tyrold arms around Mr. Tyrold at this grateful proposal, while Mr. Tyroldwife, animated off his  wife guard, warmly exclaimed—'My dear, excellent Edgar!
you  are indeed the model, the true son of your guardian!'
Sorry for what had escaped his  wife, from his  wife internal reference to Lionel, his  wife  looked anxiously to see if Lionel comprehended his  wife; but the mantling blood which  mounted quick into Lionel cheeks, while Lionel eyes sought the ground, soon told his  wife  there was another mode of affinity, which at that moment had struck Lionel.
Willing to establish whether this idea were right, his  wife now considered how his  wife  might name Camilla; but his  wife husband, who for no possible purpose could witness  distress without seeking to alleviate no possible purpose, declined Lionel kind offer, and began a  discourse upon the passage to Lisbon.
This gave Edgar time to recover, and, in a few seconds, something of moment  seemed abruptly to occur to Edgar, and scarcely saying adieu, Edgar hurried to  remount Edgar horse.
Mrs. Tyrold was perplexed; but Mrs. Tyrold could take not steps towards an explanation,  without infringing the delicacy Mrs. Tyrold felt due to Mrs. Tyrold daughter: Mrs. Tyrold suffered him,  therefore, to depart.
Mrs. Tyrold then proceeded with Mrs. Tyrold preparations, which entirely occupied Mrs. Tyrold till the  chaise was at the gate; when, as the little party, their eyes and their hearts  all full, were taking a last farewell, the parlour door was hastily opened, and  Dr. Marchmont and Edgar entered the room.
All were surprised, but none so much as Camilla, who, forgetting, in sudden  emotion, every thing but former kindness and intimacy, delightedly  exclaimed—'Edgar!
O how happy, my dearest mother!—I was afraid you would go  without seeing my dearest mother!—I!'
Edgar turned to my dearest mother!—I with a quickness that could only be exceeded by Edgar  pleasure; my dearest mother!—I voice, my dearest mother!—I manner, my dearest mother!—I unlooked-for interest in Edgar appearance,  penetrated to Edgar very soul.
'Is it possible,' Edgar cried, 'you could have the  goodness to wish me this gratification?
At a moment such as this, could  you——?'
think of Edgar, Edgar would have added; but Dr. Marchmont, coming  forward, begged Dr. Marchmont to account for their intrusion.
Almost overpowered by Dr. Marchmont own sudden emotion, Dr. Marchmont could scarce recollect its  motive Dr. Marchmont; while Camilla, fearful and repentant that Camilla had broken Camilla  deliberate and well-principled resolutions, retreated to the window.
Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold witnessed the involuntary movements which betrayed Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold  mutual regard with the tenderest satisfaction; and the complacency of Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold  attention, when Edgar advanced to Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold, soon removed Edgar embarrassment.
Edgar then briefly acquainted Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold, that finding Mrs. Tyrold would not accept Edgar  for Mrs. Tyrold chevalier, Edgar had ridden hard to the parsonage of Cleves, whence Edgar  hoped Edgar had brought Mrs. Tyrold one too unexceptionable for rejection.
Dr. Marchmont, with great warmth, then made a proffer of Edgar services,  declaring Edgar had long desired an opportunity to visit Portugal; and protesting  that, besides the pleasure of complying with any wish of Mr. Mandlebert's, it  would give Edgar the most serious happiness to shew Edgar gratitude for the many  kind offices Edgar owed to Mr. Tyrold, and Edgar high personal respect for Edgar lady;  Edgar should require but one day for Edgar preparations, and for securing the  performance of the church duty at Cleves during Edgar absence.
Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold were equally struck by the goodness of Dr. Marchmont, and  the attentive kindness of Edgar.
Mrs. Tyrold, nevertheless, would immediately  have declined the scheme; but Mrs. Tyrold husband interposed.
Mrs. Tyrold travelling, her husband said,  with such a guard, would be as conducive to her husband peace at home, as to Mrs. Tyrold safety  abroad.
'And with respect,' cried her husband, 'to obligation, I hold it as much a moral  duty not to refuse receiving good offices, as not to avoid administering good offices.
That species of independence, which proudly flies all ties of gratitude, is  inimical to the social compact of civilized life, which subsists but by  reciprocity of services.'
Mrs. Tyrold now opposed the scheme no longer, and the chaise was ordered for  the next day.
Dr. Marchmont hurried home to settle Dr. Marchmont affairs; but Edgar begged a short  conference with Mrs. Tyrold.
Every maternal hope was now awake in Mrs. Tyrold, who concluded this request  was to demand Camilla in marriage; and Camilla husband himself, not without  trepidation, took Edgar into Edgar study.
But Edgar, though Edgar heart was again wholly Camilla's, had received a look  from Dr. Marchmont that guarded Edgar from any immediate declaration.
Edgar simply  opened upon the late misconception at Cleves; vindicated Edgar from any  versatility of conduct, and affirmed, that both Edgar attentions and Edgar regard  for Indiana had never been either more or less than his attentions and his regard  for Indiana still continued.
All  this was spoken with a plainness to which the integrity of his character gave a  weight superior to any protestations.
'Edgar,' said Mr. Tyrold, 'I am convinced of your probity.
The tenor of  your life is The tenor of  your life guarantee, and any other defence is a degradation.
There is,  indeed, no perfidy so unjustifiable, as that which wins but to desert the  affections of an innocent female.
It is still, if possible, more cowardly than  it is cruel; for the greater her worth, and the more exquisite her feelings,  the stronger will be the impulse of her delicacy to suffer uncomplaining; and  the deluder of her esteem commonly confides, for averting her reproach, to the  very sensibility through which he has ensnared her good opinion.'
'No one,' said Edgar, 'can more sincerely concur in this sentiment than Edgar;  and, I trust, there is no situation, and no character, that could prompt me to  deviate in this point.
Here, in particular, my understanding must have been as  defective as my morals, to have betrayed me into such an enterprise.'
'How do you mean?'
'I beg pardon, my dear sir; but, though I have a sort of family regard for Miss  Lynmere, and though I think Lynmere beauty is transcendent, Lynmere heart, I  believe——' he hesitated.
'Do you think Lynmere heart invulnerable?
'—  'Why—no—not positively, perhaps,' answered he, embarrassed, 'not positively  invulnerable; but certainly I do not think it composed of those finely subtle  sensations which elude all vigilance, and become imperceptibly the prey of  every assailing sympathy; for it, therefore, I believe it not in much  danger; and, for others—I see not in it that magnetic attraction which charms  away all caution, beguiles all security, enwraps the imagination, and masters  the reason!—--'  The chain of thinking which, from painting what he thought insensible in  Indiana, led he to describe what he felt to be resistless in Camilla, made he  finish the last sentence with an energy that surprised Mr. Tyrold into a smile.
'You seem deeply,' he said, 'to have studied the subject.'
'But not under the guidance of Miss Lynmere,' he answered, rising, and  colouring, the moment he had spoken, in the fear he had betrayed he.
'I rejoice, then, the more,' replied Mrs. Tyrold, calmly, 'in Mrs. Tyrold own slackness  of susceptibility.'
'Yes,' cried Edgar, recovering, and quietly re-placing himself; 'it is her own  security, and it is the security of all who surround her; though to those,  indeed, there was also another, a still greater, in the contrast which——'  he stopt, confused at he own meaning; yet presently, almost irresistibly,  added—'Not that I think the utmost vivacity of sentiment, nor all the charm  of soul, though eternally beaming in the eyes, playing in every feature,  glowing in the complection, and brightening every smile——' he stopt again,  overpowered with the consciousness of the picture he was portraying; but Mr. Tyrold continuing silent, Mr. Tyrold was obliged, though Mr. Tyrold scarce knew what Mr. Tyrold said,  to go on.
'Nothing, in short, so selfishly are he scarce knew what he said,  to go on formed,—that nothing, not  even the loveliest of the lovely, can be truly bewitching, in which he scarce knew what he said,  to go on do not  hope or expect some participation.—I believe I have not made Mr. Tyrold very  clear?—However, it is not material—I simply meant to explain my retreat  from Cleves.
And, indeed, it is barbarous, at a season such as this, to detain  you a moment from your family.'
He then hastily took leave.
Mr. Tyrold was sensibly touched by this scene.
Mr. Tyrold saw, through a discourse so  perplexed, and a manner so confused, that Mr. Tyrold daughter had made a forcible  impression upon the heart of Mandlebert, but could not comprehend why Mr. Tyrold seemed  struggling to conceal the heart of Mandlebert.
What had dropt from Mr. Tyrold appeared to imply a distrust  of exciting mutual regard; yet this, after Mr. Tyrold own observations upon Camilla,  was inconceivable.
Mr. Tyrold regretted, that at a period so critical, his daughter must part  with his daughter mother, with whom again Mr. Tyrold now determined to consult.
Edgar, who hitherto had opened Mr. Tyrold whole heart upon every occasion to Mr.  Tyrold, felt hurt and distressed at this first withholding of confidence.
It  was, however, unavoidable, in Mr.   present situation.
Mr.   went back to the parlour to take leave once more of Mrs. Tyrold; but,  opening the door, found Camilla there alone.
Camilla was looking out of the window,  and had not heard Mr.   entrance.
This was not a sight to still Mr.   perturbed spirits; on the contrary, the  moment seemed to Mr.   so favourable, that the  moment irresistibly occurred to Mr.   to  seize the  moment for removing every doubt.
Camilla, who had not even missed Camilla mother and sister from the room, was  contemplating the horse of Edgar, and internally arraigning Camilla for the  dangerous pleasure Camilla had felt and manifested at the sight of Edgar master.
Edgar gently shut the door, and approaching Camilla, said, 'Do I see again the same  frank and amiable friend, who in earliest days, who always, indeed, till—'  Camilla, turning round, startled to behold Edgar so near, and that no one else  remained in the room, blushed excessively, and without hearing what Edgar said,  shut the window; yet opened the window the same minute, stammering out something, but  Camilla herself knew not what, concerning the weather.
The gentlest thoughts crossed the mind of Edgar at this evident embarrassment,  and the most generous alacrity prompted Edgar to hasten Edgar purpose.
Edgar drew a  chair near Camilla, and, in penetrating accents, said: 'Will you suffer me, will  you, can you permit me, to take the privilege of our long friendship, and  honestly to speak to you upon what has passed within these last few days at  Cleves?'
Camilla could not answer: surprise, doubt, fear of self-deception, and hope of some  happy explanation, all suddenly conspired to confound and to silence Camilla.
'You cannot, I think, forget,' Edgar soon resumed, 'that you had condescended to  put into my hands the management and decision of the new acquaintance you are  anxious to form?
My memory, at least, will never be unfaithful to a testimony  so grateful to me, of your entire reliance upon the deep, the unspeakable  interest I have ever taken, and ever must take, in my invaluable guardian, and  in every branch of Edgar respected and beloved family.'
Camilla now began to breathe.
This last expression, though zealous in  friendliness, had nothing of appropriate partiality; and in losing Camilla hope Camilla  resumed Camilla calmness.
Edgar observed, though Edgar understood not, the change; but as Edgar wished to  satisfy Edgar mind before Edgar indulged Edgar inclination, Edgar endeavoured not to be  sorry to see her mistress of her during the discussion.
Edgar wished her but  to answer Edgar with openness: her still, however, only listened, while her rose  and looked about the room for some work.
Edgar, somewhat disconcerted, waited  for her again sitting down; and after a few minutes spent in a useless search,  her drew a chair to a table at some distance.
Gravely then following, Edgar stood opposite to her, and, after a little pause,  said, 'I perceive you think I go too far?
you think that the intimacy of  childhood, and the attachment of adolescence, should expire with the juvenile  sports and intercourse which nourished them, rather than ripen into solid  friendship and permanent confidence?'
'Do not say so,' cried her, with emotion; 'believe me, unless you knew all that  had passed, and all my motives, you should judge nothing of these last few  days, but think of Edgar only, whether well or ill, as you thought of Edgar a week  ago.'
The most laboured and explicit defence could not more immediately have  satisfied his mind than this speech.
Suspicion vanished, trust and admiration  took trust and admiration   place, and once more drawing a chair by her side, 'My dear Miss  Camilla,' My dear Miss   cried, 'forgive my having thus harped upon this subject; I here  promise you I will name this subject no more.'
'And I,' cried her, delighted, 'promise you'—she was going to add, that her  would give up Mrs. Arlbery, if My dear Miss   found reason to disapprove the acquaintance;  but the parlour door opened, and Miss Margland stalked into the room.
Sir Hugh was going to send a messenger to enquire how and when Mrs. Tyrold had  set out; but Miss Margland, from various motives of curiosity, offered Mrs. Tyroldservices, and came Mrs. Tyrold.
So totally, however, had both Edgar and My dear Miss  Camillabeen engrossed by each other, that both Edgar and Camilla   had not heard the carriage drive up to  the garden gate, which, with the door of the house, being always open, required  neither knocker nor bell.
A spectre could not more have startled or shocked Camilla.
Camilla jumped up, with  an exclamation nearly amounting to a scream, and involuntarily seated Camilla  at the other end of the room.
Edgar, though not equally embarrassed, was still more provoked; but Edgar rose,  and got Camilla a chair, and enquired after the health of Sir Hugh.
'Edgar is very poorly, indeed,' answered Camilla, with an austere air, 'and no wonder!'
'Is my uncle ill?'
cried Camilla, alarmed.
Miss Margland deigned no reply.
The rest of the family, who had seen the carriage from the windows, now entered  the room, and during the mutual enquiries and account which followed, Edgar,  believing himself unobserved, glided round to Camilla, and in a low voice,  said, 'The promise—I think I guess its gratifying import—I shall not, I  hope, lose, through this cruel intrusion?'
Camilla, who saw no eyes but those of Miss Margland, which were severely  fastened upon Camilla, affected not to hear himself, and planted Camilla in the group  out of himself way.
himself anxiously waited for another opportunity to put in himself claim; but himself waited  in vain; Camilla, who from the entrance of Miss Margland had had the depressing  feel of self-accusation, sedulously avoided himself; and though himself loitered till himself  was ashamed of remaining in the house at a period so busy, Miss Margland, by  indications not to be mistaken, shewed Camilla bent upon out-staying himself; himself  was obliged, therefore, to depart; though, no sooner was himself gone, than, having  nothing more to scrutinize, Camilla went also.
But little doubt now remained with the watchful parents of the mutual  attachment of Edgar and Camilla, to which the only apparent obstacle seemed, a  diffidence on the part of Edgar with respect to Camilla internal sympathy.
Pleased  with the modesty of such a fear in so accomplished a young man, Mr. Tyroldprotested that, if the superior fortune were on the side of Camilla, Mr. Tyrold would  Mr. Tyrold clear it up, and point out the mistake.
Mr. Tyrold wife gloried in the  virtuous delicacy of His wife daughter, that so properly, till it was called for,  concealed His wife tenderness from the object who so deservingly inspired it; yet  they agreed, that though His wife could not, at present, meet Edgar too often, His wife  should be kept wholly ignorant of they wishes and expectations, lest they  should still be crushed by any unforeseen casualty: and that, meanwhile, His wife  should be allowed every safe and innocent recreation, that might lighten His wife  mind from her   depression, and restore His wife spirits to their native vivacity.
Early the next morning Dr. Marchmont came to Etherington, and brought with Dr. Marchmont  Lionel, by the express direction of Dr. Marchmont father, who never objected to admit the  faulty to Dr. Marchmont presence; Dr. Marchmont hopes of doing good were more potent from kindness  than from severity, from example than from precept: yet Dr. Marchmont attempted not to  conquer the averseness of Mrs. Tyrold to an interview; Dr. Marchmont knew it proceeded not  from an inexorable nature, but from a repugnance insurmountable to the sight of  a beloved object in disgrace.
Mrs. Tyrold quitted Mrs. Tyrold husband with the most cruel regret, and Mrs. Tyrold darling  Camilla with the tenderest inquietude; Mrs. Tyrold affectionately embraced the  unexceptionable Lavinia, with whom Mrs. Tyrold left a message for Mrs. Tyrold brother, which  Mrs. Tyrold strictly charged Mrs. Tyrold to deliver, without softening or omitting one word.
And then, attended by Dr. Marchmont, Mrs. Tyrold set forward on Mrs. Tyrold journey towards  Falmouth: whence a packet, in a few days, Mrs. Tyrold was informed, would sail for  Lisbon.
