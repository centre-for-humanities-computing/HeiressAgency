 Traits of Eccentricity  Thus passed the first eight days of the Tunbridge excursion, and another week  succeeded without any varying event.  Mrs. Arlbery now, impelled with concern for Camilla, and resentment against  Edgar, renewed the subject of her opinion and advice upon his character and  conduct. 'My dear young friend,' cried she, 'I cannot bear to see your days,  your views, your feelings, thus fruitlessly consumed: I have observed this  young man narrowly, and I am convinced he is not worth your consideration.'  Camilla, deeply colouring, was beginning to assure her she had no need of this  counsel; but Mrs. Arlbery, not listening, continued.  'I know what you must say; yet, once more, I cannot refrain venturing at the  liberty of lending you my experience. Turn your mind from him with all the  expedition in your power, or its peace may be touched for the better half of  your life. You do not see, he does not, perhaps, himself know, how exactly he  is calculated to make you wretched. He is a watcher; and a watcher, restless  and perturbed himself, infests all he pursues with uneasiness. He is without  trust, and therefore without either courage or consistency. To-day he may be  persuaded you will make all his happiness; to-morrow, he may fear you will give  him nothing but misery. Yet it is not that he is jealous of any other; 'tis of  the object of his choice he is jealous, lest she should not prove good enough  to merit it. Such a man, after long wavering, and losing probable happiness in  the terror of possible disappointment, will either die an old batchelor, with  endless repinings at his own lingering fastidiousness, or else marry just at  the eve of confinement for life, from a fit of the gout. He then makes, on a  sudden, the first prudent choice in his way; a choice no longer difficult, but  from the embarrassment of its ease; for she must have no beauty, lest she  should be sought by others, no wit, lest others should be sought by herself;  and no fortune, lest she should bring with it a taste of independence, that  might curb his own will, when the strength and spirit are gone with which he  might have curbed her's.'  Camilla attempted to laugh at this portrait; but Mrs. Arlbery entreated her to  consider it as faithful and exact. 'You have thought of him too much,' cried  she, 'to do justice to any other, or you would not, with such perfect  unconcern, pass by your daily increasing influence with Sir Sedley Clarendel.'  Excessively, and very seriously offended, Camilla earnestly besought to be  spared any hints of such a nature.  'I know well,' cried she, 'how repugnant to seventeen is every idea of life  that is rational. Let us, therefore, set aside, in our discussions, any thing  so really beneficial, as a solid connection formed with a view to the worldly  comforts of existence, and speak of Sir Sedley's devoirs merely as the  instrument of teaching Mandlebert, that he is not the only rich, young, and  handsome man in this lower sphere, who has viewed Miss Camilla Tyrold with  complacency. Clarendel, it is true, would lose every charm in my estimation by  losing his heart; for the earth holds nothing comparable for deadness of  weight, with a poor soul really in love—except when it happens to be with  oneself!—yet, to alarm the selfish irresolution of that impenetrable  Mandlebert, I should really delight to behold him completely caught.'  Camilla, distressed and confused, sought to parry the whole as raillery: but  Mrs. Arlbery would not be turned aside from her subject and purpose. 'I  languish, I own,' cried she, 'to see that frozen youth worked up into a little  sensibility. I have an instinctive aversion to those cold, haughty,  drawing-back characters, who are made up of the egotism of looking out for  something that is wholly devoted to them, and that has not a breath to breathe  that is not a sigh for their perfections.'  'O! this is far ...' Camilla began, meaning to say, far from the character of  Mandlebert; but ashamed of undertaking his defence, she stopt short, and only  mentally added, Even excellence such as his cannot, then, withstand prejudice!  'If there is any way,' continued Mrs. Arlbery, 'of animating him for a moment  out of himself, it can only be by giving him a dread of some other. The poor  Major does his best; but he is not rich enough to be feared, unless he were  more attractive. Sir Sedley will seem more formidable. Countenance, therefore,  his present propensity to wear your chains, till Mandlebert perceives that he  is putting them on; and then ... mount to the rising ground you ought to tread,  and shew, at once, your power and your disinterestedness, by turning from the  handsome Baronet and all his immense wealth, to mark ... since you are  determined to indulge it ... your unbiassed preference for Mandlebert.'  Camilla, irresistibly appeased by a picture so flattering to all her best  feelings, and dearest wishes, looked down; angry with herself to find she felt  no longer angry with Mrs. Arlbery.  Mrs. Arlbery, perceiving a point gained, determined to enforce the blow, and  then leave her to her reflections.  'Mandlebert is a creature whose whole composition is a pile of accumulated  punctilios. He will spend his life in refining away his own happiness: but do  not let him refine away yours. He is just a man to bewitch an innocent and  unguarded young woman from forming any other connexion, and yet, when her youth  and expectations have been sacrificed to his hesitation, ... to conceive he  does not use her ill in thinking of her no more, because he has entered into no  verbal engagement. If his honour cannot be arraigned of breaking any bond, ...  What matters merely breaking her heart?'  She then left the room; but Camilla dwelt upon nothing she had uttered except  the one dear and inviting project of proving disinterestedness to Edgar. 'O! if  once,' she cried, 'I could annihilate every mercenary suspicion! If once I  could shew Edgar that his situation has no charms for me ... and it has none!  none! then, indeed, I am his equal, though I am nothing, ... equal in what is  highest, in mind, in spirit, in sentiment!  From this time the whole of her behaviour became coloured by this fascinating  idea; and a scheme which, if proposed to her under its real name of coquetry,  she would have fled and condemned with antipathy, when presented to her as a  means to mark her freedom from sordid motives, she adopted with inconsiderate  fondness. The sight, therefore, of Edgar, wherever she met him, became now the  signal for adding spirit to the pleasure with which, already, and without any  design, she had attended to the young Baronet. Exertion gave to her the gaiety  of which solicitude had deprived her, and she appeared, in the eyes of Sir  Sedley, every day more charming. She indulged him with the history of her  adventure at the house of Mr. Dubster, and his prevalent taste for the  ridiculous made the account enchant him. He cast off, in return, all airs of  affectation, when he conversed with her separately; and though still, in all  mixt companies, they were resumed, the real integrity, as well as indifference  of her heart, made that a circumstance but to stimulate this new species of  intercourse, by representing it to be equally void of future danger to them  both.  All this, however, failed of its desired end. Edgar never saw her engaged by  Sir Sedley, but he thought her youthfully grateful, and esteemed her the more,  or beheld her as a mere coquette, and ceased to esteem her at all. But never  for a moment was any personal uneasiness excited by their mutually increasing  intimacy. The conversations he had held, both with the Baronet and herself, had  satisfied him that neither entertained one serious thought of the other; and he  took, therefore, no interest in their acquaintance, beyond that which was  always alive,—a vigilant concern for the manner in which it might operate  upon her disposition.  With respect to the Major, he was by no means so entirely at his ease. He saw  him still the declared and undisguised pursuer of her favour; and though he  perceived, at the same time, she rather avoided than sought him, he still  imagined, in general, his acceptance was arranged, from the many preceding  circumstances which had first given him that belief. The whole of her  behaviour, nevertheless, perplexed as much as it grieved him, and frequently,  in the same half hour, she seemed to him all that was most amiable for  inspiring admiration, and all that was least to be depended upon, for retaining  attachment.  Yet however, from time to time, he felt alarmed or offended, he never ceased to  experience the fondest interest in her happiness, nor the most tender  compassion for the dangers with which he saw her environed. He knew, that  though her understanding was excellent, her temper was so inconsiderate, that  she rarely consulted it; and that, though her mind was of the purest innocence,  it was unguarded by caution, and unprotected by reflexion. He thought her  placed where far higher discretion, far superior experience, might risk being  shaken; and he did not more fervently wish, than internally tremble, for her  safety. Wherever she appeared, she was sure of distinction: ''Tis Miss Tyrold,  the friend of Mrs. Berlinton,' was buzzed round the moment she was seen; and  the particular favour in which she stood with some votaries of the ton, made  even her artlessness, her retired education, and her ignorance of all that  pertained to the certain circles, past over and forgiven, in consideration of  her personal attractions, her youth, and newness.  Still, however, even this celebrity was not what most he dreaded: so sudden and  unexpected an elevation upon the heights of fashionable fame might make her  head, indeed, giddy, but her heart he thought formed of materials too pure and  too good to be endangered so lightly; and though frequently, when he saw her so  circumstanced, he feared she was undone for private life, he could not reflect  upon her principles and disposition, without soon recovering the belief that a  short time might restore her mind to its native simplicity and worth. But  another rock was in the way, against which he apprehended she might be dashed,  whilst least suspicious of any peril.  This rock, indeed, exhibited nothing to the view that could have affrighted any  spectator less anxiously watchful, or less personally interested in regarding  it. But youth itself, in the fervour of a strong attachment, is as open-eyed,  as observant, and as prophetic as age, with all its concomitants of practice,  time, and suspicion. This rock, indeed, far from giving notice of danger by any  sharp points or rough prominences, displayed only the smoothest and most  inviting surface: for it was Mrs. Berlinton, the beautiful, the accomplished,  the attractive Mrs. Berlinton, whom he beheld as the object of the greatest  risk she had to encounter.  As he still preserved the character with which she had consented to invest him  of her monitor, he seized every opportunity of communicating to her his doubts  and apprehensions. But in proportion as her connexion with that lady increased,  use to her manners and sentiments abated the wonderment they inspired, and they  soon began to communicate an unmixt charm, that made all other society, that of  Edgar alone excepted, heartless and uninteresting. Yet, in the conversations  she held with him from time to time, she frankly related the extraordinary  attachment of her new friend to some unknown correspondent, and confessed her  own surprise when it first came to her knowledge.  Edgar listened to the account with the most unaffected dismay, and represented  the probable danger, and actual impropriety of such an intercourse, in the  strongest and most eloquent terms; but he could neither appal her confidence,  nor subdue her esteem. The openness with which all had originally and  voluntarily been avowed, convinced her of the innocence with which it was felt,  and all that his exhortations could obtain, was a remonstrance on her own part  to Mrs. Berlinton.  She found that lady, however, persuaded she indulged but an innocent  friendship, which she assured her was bestowed upon a person of as much honour  as merit, and which only with life she should relinquish, since it was the sole  consolation of her fettered existence.  Edgar, to whom this was communicated, saw with terror the ascendance thus  acquired over her judgment as well as her affections, and became more watchful  and more uneasy in observing the progress of this friendship, than all the  flattering devoirs of the gay Baronet, or the more serious assiduities of the  Major.  Mrs. Berlinton, indeed, was no common object, either for fear or for hope, for  admiration or for censure. She possessed all that was most softly attractive,  most bewitchingly beautiful, and most irresistibly captivating, in mind,  person, and manners. But to all that was thus most fascinating to others, she  joined unhappily all that was most dangerous for herself; an heart the most  susceptible, sentiments the most romantic, and an imagination the most exalted.  She had been an orphan from earliest years, and left, with an only brother, to  the care of a fanatical maiden aunt, who had taught her nothing but her faith  and her prayers, without one single lesson upon good works, or the smallest  instruction upon the practical use of her theoretical piety. All that ever  varied these studies were some common and ill selected novels and romances,  which a young lady in the neighbourhood privately lent her to read; till her  brother, upon his first vacation from the University, brought her the works of  the Poets. These, also, it was only in secret she could enjoy; but, to her  juvenile fancy, and irregularly principled mind, that did not render them more  tasteless. Whatever was most beautifully picturesque in poetry, she saw  verified in the charming landscapes presented to her view in the part of Wales  she inhabited; whatever was most noble or tender in romance, she felt promptly  in her heart, and conceived to be general; and whatever was enthusiastic in  theology, formed the whole of her idea and her belief with respect to religion.  Brought up thus, to think all things the most unusual and extraordinary, were  merely common and of course; she was romantic without consciousness, and  excentric without intention. Nothing steady or rational had been instilled into  her mind by others; and she was too young, and too fanciful to have formed her  own principles with any depth of reflection, or study of propriety. She had  entered the world, by a sudden and most unequal marriage, in which her choice  had no part, with only two self-formed maxims for the law of her conduct. The  first of these was, that, from her early notions of religion, no vestal should  be more personally chaste; the second, that, from her more recently imbibed  ones of tenderness, her heart, since she was married without its concurrence,  was still wholly at liberty to be disposed of by its own propensities, without  reproach and without scruple.  With such a character, where virtue had so little guide even while innocence  presided; where the person was so alluring, and the situation so open to  temptation, Edgar saw with almost every species of concern the daily increasing  friendship of Camilla. Yet while he feared for her firmness, he knew not how to  blame her fondness; nor where so much was amiable in its object, could he cease  to wish that more were right.  Thus again lived and died another week; and the fourth succeeded with no actual  occurrence, but a new change of opinion in Mrs. Arlbery, that forcibly and  cruelly affected the feelings of Camilla.  Uninformed of the motive that occasioned the indifference with which Edgar  beheld the newly awakened gallantry of Sir Sedley, and the pleasure with which  Camilla received it, Mrs. Arlbery observed his total unconcern, first with  surprise, next with perplexity, and finally with a belief he was seriously  resolved against forming any connection with her himself. This she took an  early opportunity to intimate to Camilla, warmly exhorting her to drive him  fast from her mind.  Camilla assured her that no task could be more easy; but the disappointment of  the project with respect to Sir Sedley, which she blushed to have adopted, hurt  her in every possible direction. Coquetry was as foreign to the ingenuousness  of her nature, as to the dignity of all her early maternal precepts. She had  hastily encouraged the devoirs of the Baronet, upon the recommendation of a  woman she loved and admired; but now, that the failure of her aim brought her  to reflexion, she felt penitent and ashamed to have heeded any advice so  contrary to the singleness of the doctrines of her father, and so inferior to  the elevation of every sentiment she had ever heard from her mother. If Edgar  had seen her design, he had surely seen it with contempt: and though his manner  was still the most gentle, and his advice ever ready and friendly, the opinion  of Mrs. Arlbery was corroborated by all her own observations, that he was  decidedly estranged from her.  What repentance ensued! what severity of regret! how did she canvass her  conduct, how lament she had ever formed that fatal acquaintance with Mrs.  Arlbery, which he had so early opposed, and which seemed eternally destined to  lead her into measures and conduct most foreign to his approbation!  The melancholy that now again took possession of her spirits made her decline  going abroad, from a renewed determination to avoid all meetings with Edgar.  Mrs. Arlbery felt provoked to find his power thus unabated, and Sir Sedley was  astonished. He still saw her perpetually, from his visits at Mount Pleasant;  but his vanity, that weakest yet most predominant feature of his character,  received a shock for which no modesty of apprehension or fore-thought had  prepared him, in finding that, when he saw her no more in the presence of  Mandlebert, he saw her no more the same. She was ready still to converse with  him; but no peculiar attention was flattering, no desire to oblige was pointed.  He found he had been merely a passive instrument, in her estimation, to excite  jealousy; and even as such had been powerless to produce that effect. The  raillery which Mrs. Arlbery spared not upon the occasion added greatly to his  pique, and his mortification was so visible, that Camilla perceived it, and  perceived it with pain, with shame, and with surprise. She thought now, for the  first time, that the public homage he had paid her had private and serious  motives, and that what she imagined mere sportive gallantry, arose from a  growing attachment.  This idea had no gratifying power; believing Edgar without care for her, she  could not hope it would stimulate his regard; and conceiving she had herself  excited the partiality by wilful civilities, she could feel only reproach from  a conquest, unduly, unfairly, uningenuously obtained.  In proportion as these self-upbraidings made her less deserving in her own  eyes, the merits of the young Baronet seemed to augment; and in considering  herself as culpable for having raised his regard, she appeared before him with  a humility that gave a softness to her look and manners, which soon proved as  interesting to Sir Sedley as her marked gaiety had been flattering.  When she perceived this, she felt distressed anew. To shun him was impossible,  as Mrs. Arlbery not only gave him completely the freedom of her house, but  assiduously promoted their belonging always to the same group, and being seated  next to each other. There was nothing she would not have done to extenuate her  error, and to obviate its ill effect upon Sir Sedley; but as she always thought  herself in the wrong, and regarded him as injured, every effort was accompanied  with a timidity that gave to every change a new charm, rather than any  repulsive quality.  In this state of total self-disapprobation, to return to Etherington was her  only wish, and to pass the intermediate time with Mrs. Berlinton became her  sole pleasure. But she was forced again into public to avoid an almost single  intercourse with Sir Sedley.  In meeting again with Edgar she saw him openly delighted at her sight, but  without the least apparent solicitude, or notice, that the young Baronet had  passed almost the whole of the interval upon Mount Pleasant.  This was instantly noticed, and instantly commented upon by Mrs. Arlbery, who  again, and strongly pointed out to Camilla, that to save her youth from being  wasted by fruitless expectation, she must forget young Mandlebert, and study  only her own amusement.  Camilla dissented not from the opinion; but the doctrine to which it was easy  to agree, it was difficult to put in practice; and her ardent mind believed  itself fettered for ever, and for ever unhappy.
