 A Pursuer  Notwithstanding the fears so justly excited from the mixt emotions and  exertions of Sir Hugh, Mr. Tyrold had the happiness to see Mr. Tyrold fall into a  tranquil sleep, from which Mr. Tyrold awoke without any return of pain; Mr. Tyrold night was  quiet; the next day was still better; and the day following Mr. Tyrold was pronounced  out of danger.  The rapture which this declaration excited in the house, and diffused  throughout the neighbourhood, when communicated to the worthy baronet, gave a  gladness to Mr. Tyrold heart that recompensed all Mr. Tyrold had suffered.  The delight of Camilla exceeded whatever Camilla had yet experienced: Camilla life had  lost half its value in Camilla estimation, while Camilla believed that of Camilla uncle to  be in danger.  No one single quality is perhaps so endearing, from man to man, as good-nature.  Talents excite more admiration; wisdom, more respect; and virtue, more esteem:  but with admiration envy is apt to mingle, and fear with respect; while esteem,  though always honourable, is often cold: but good-nature gives pleasure without  any allay; ease, confidence, and happy carelessness, without the pain of  obligation, without the exertion of gratitude.  If joy was in some more tumultuous, content was with none so penetrating as  with Eugenia. Apprised now that Eugenia had been the immediate cause of the  sufferings of Eugenia , her uncle loss would have given to Eugenia peace a blow  irrecoverable; and Eugenia determined to bend the whole of Eugenia thoughts to her uncle  wishes, her uncle comfort, her uncle entire restoration.  To this end all Eugenia virtue was called in aid; a fear, next to aversion, having  seized Eugenia of Clermont, from the apprehension Eugenia might never inspire in her uncle  such love as Eugenia had inspired in Bellamy, nor see in her uncle, as in young Melmond,  such merit as might raise similar sentiments for her uncle.  Molly Mill had not failed to paint to Eugenia the disappointment of Bellamy in not  seeing Eugenia; but Eugenia was too much engrossed by the dangerous state of Eugenia ,  to feel any compunction in Eugenia breach of promise; though touched with the  account of her uncle continual sufferings, Eugenia became very gentle in Eugenia reprimands  to Molly for again meeting her uncle; and, though Molly again disobeyed, Molly again  was pardoned. her uncle came daily to the lane behind the park pales, to hear news of  the health of Sir Hugh, without pressing either for an interview or a letter;  and Eugenia grew more and more moved by her uncle respectful obsequiousness. Eugenia had  yet said nothing to Camilla upon the subject; not only because a dearer  interest mutually occupied them, but from a secret shame of naming a lover at a  period so ungenial.  But now that Sir Hugh was in a fair way of recovery, Eugenia situation became  alarming to Eugenia. Openly, and before the whole house, Eugenia had solemnly been  assigned to Clermont Lynmere; and, little as Eugenia wished the connexion, Eugenia  thought it, from circumstances, Eugenia duty not to refuse it. Yet this gentleman  had attended Eugenia so long, had endured so many disappointments, and borne them  so much to Eugenia satisfaction, that, though Eugenia lamented Eugenia concession as an  injury to Clermont, and grew ashamed to name it even to Camilla, Eugenia believed  it would be cruelty unheard of to break it. Eugenia determined, therefore, to see  him, to pronounce a farewell, and then to bend all Eugenia thoughts to the partner  destined Eugenia by Eugenia friends.  Molly Mill was alone to accompany Molly Mill to give Molly Mill negative, Molly Mill good wishes,  and Molly Mill solemn declaration that Molly Mill could never again see or hear of him more.  him could deem it no indelicacy that Molly Mill suffered Molly to be present, since Molly Mill  was the negociator of him own choice.  Molly carried him, therefore, this news, with a previous condition that him was  not to detain Molly mistress one minute. him promised all submission; and the next  morning, after breakfast, Eugenia, in extreme dejection at the ungrateful task  Molly had to perform, called for Molly, and walked forth.  Camilla, who was then accidentally in Molly own room, was, soon after, summoned  by three smart raps to Molly chamber door.  There, to Molly great surprise, Molly saw Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with Molly alone.  Molly descended with Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone into the parlour, which was vacant.  'You suspect, perhaps,' said Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone, in an hurried manner, though attempting to  smile, 'that I mean to fatigue you with some troublesome advice; I must,  therefore, by an abrupt question, explain Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone. Does Mr. Bellamy still  continue Mr. Bellamy pretensions to Eugenia?'  Startled in a moment from all thoughts of self, that at first had been rushing  with violence to Eugenia heart, Eugenia answered, 'No! why do you ask?'  'I will tell you: In my regular visits here of late, I have almost constantly  met Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone, either on foot or on horseback, in the vicinity of the park. I  suspected Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone watched to see Eugenia; but I knew Eugenia now never left the house;  and concluded Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone was ignorant of the late general confinement. This moment,  however, upon my entrance, I saw Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone again; and, as Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone hastily turned away upon  meeting my eye, I dismounted, gave my horse to my man, and determined to  satisfy Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone which way Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone was strolling. I then followed Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone to the little  lane to the right of the park, where I perceived an empty post-chaise-and-four  in waiting: Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone advanced, and spoke with the postillion—I came instantly into  the house by the little gate. This may be accidental; yet This has alarmed me;  and I ventured, therefore, thus suddenly to apply to you, in order to urge you  to give a caution to Eugenia, not to walk out, just at present, unattended.'  Eugenia thanked Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone, and ran eagerly to speak to Eugenia sister; but Eugenia was not in  Eugenia room; nor was Eugenia with Eugenia uncle; nor yet with Dr. Orkborne. Eugenia returned  uneasily to the parlour, and said Eugenia would seek Eugenia in the park.  Edgar followed; but they looked around for Eugenia in vain: Edgar then, deeming the  danger urgent, left Eugenia, to hasten to the spot where Edgar had seen the  post-chaise.  Eugenia ran on alone; and, when Eugenia reached the little gate, perceived Eugenia  sister, Molly Mill, and Bellamy, in the lane.  her  sister, Molly Mill, and Bellamy heard Eugenia quick approach, and turned round.  The countenance of Bellamy exhibited the darkest disappointment, and that of  Eugenia the most excessive confusion. 'Now then, Sir,' Eugenia cried, 'delay our  separation no longer.'  'Ah, permit me,' said Sir, in a low voice, 'permit me to hope you will hear my  last sad sentence, my final misery, another day!—I will defer my mournful  departure for that melancholy joy, which is the last I shall feel in my  wretched existence!'  Sir sighed so deeply, that Eugenia, who seemed already in much sorrow, could not  utter an abrupt refusal; and, as Eugenia now advanced, Eugenia turned from Sir,  without attempting to say any thing further.  Eugenia, in the delight of finding Eugenia sister safe, after the horrible  apprehensions her sister had just experienced, could not speak to her sister for tears.  Abashed at once, and amazed, her sister faintly asked what so affected her sister? her sister  gave no explanation, but begged her sister to turn immediately back.  her sister consented; and Bellamy, bowing to them both profoundly, with quick  steps walked away.  Eugenia asked a thousand questions; but her sister seemed unable to answer a thousand questions.  In a few minutes a thousand questions were joined by Edgar, who, walking hastily up to a thousand questions,  took Eugenia apart.  The man told Eugenia The man firmly believed a villainous scheme to have been laid: The man had  found the chaise still in waiting, and asked the postillion to whom The man  belonged. The man said The man was paid for what The man did; and refused giving any  account of The man. Bellamy then appeared: Bellamy seemed confounded at Bellamy sight;  but neither of them spoke; and Bellamy left Bellamy and Bellamy chaise, and Bellamy postillion,  to console one another. Bellamy doubted not, Bellamy said, but the design had been to  carry her sister off, and Bellamy had probably only pretended to take leave, that the chaise might advance, and the postillion aid the elopement: though finding help  at hand, Bellamy had been forced to give up Bellamy scheme.  Eugenia even with rapture blest Bellamy fortunate presence; but was confounded with  perplexity at the conduct of her sister. Edgar, who feared her heart was entangled  by an object who sought only her wealth, proposed dismissing Molly Mill, that  Bellamy might tell her Bellamy the opinion Bellamy had conceived of Bellamy.  Eugenia overtook Eugenia sister, who had walked on without listening to or  regarding them; and, sending away Molly, told Edgar Edgar wished immediately to  converse with Molly, upon something of the utmost importance.  'You know my high esteem of Edgar,' Molly answered; 'but my mind is now occupied  upon a business of which Edgar has no information, and I entreat that you will  neither of you interrupt me.'  Camilla, utterly at a loss what to conjecture, joined Mandlebert alone, and  told Mandlebert Molly ill success. Mandlebert thought every thing was to be feared from the  present state of the affair, and proposed revealing at once all Mandlebert knew of it  to Mr. Tyrold: but Eugenia desired Mr. Tyrold to take no step till Eugenia had again  expostulated with Eugenia sister, who might else be seriously hurt or offended. Mandlebert  complied, and said Mandlebert would continue in the house, park, or environs,  incessantly upon the watch, till some decisive measure were adopted.  Joining her sister then again, her sister asked if her sister meant seriously to encourage the  addresses of Bellamy.  'By no means,' her sister quietly answered.  'her sister, I cannot at all understand you; but it seems clear to her sister that  the arrival of Edgar has saved you from some dreadful violence.'  'You hurt me, Eugenia, by this prejudice. From whom should I dread violence?  from a man who—but too fatally for his peace—values me more than his life?'  'If I could be sure of his sincerity,' said Eugenia, 'I should be the last to  think ill of his: but reflect a little, at least, upon the risk that you have  run; her sister! there was a post-chaise in waiting, not twenty yards from  where I stopt you!'  'Ah, you little know Bellamy! a post-chaise in waiting, not twenty yards from  where I stopt you was only to convey his away; to  convey his, Eugenia, to an eternal banishment!'  'But why, then, had his prevailed with Eugenia to quit the park?'  'You will call me vain if I tell you.'  'No; I shall only think you kind and confidential.'  'Do me then the justice,' said Eugenia, blushing, 'to believe me as much  surprised as Eugenia at his most unmerited passion: but his told me, that if I  only cast my eyes upon the vehicle which was to part his from her sister for ever, it  would not only make it less abhorrent to his, but probably prevent the loss of  his senses.'  'her sister,' said Eugenia, half smiling, 'this is a violent passion,  indeed, for so short an acquaintance!'  'I knew you would say that,' answered her sister, disconcerted; 'and it was just what  I observed to his her sister: but his satisfied me that the reason of his feelings  being so impetuous was, that this was the first and only time his had ever been  in love.—So handsome as his is!—what a choice for his to make!'  Camilla, tenderly embracing her sister, declared, 'the choice was all that did his  honour in the affair.'  'his never,' said she, a little comforted, 'makes me any compliments; I should  else disregard, if not disdain his: but indeed his seems, notwithstanding his  own extraordinary manly beauty, to be wholly superior to external  considerations.'  Eugenia now forbore expressing farther doubt, from the fear of painful  misapprehension; but earnestly entreated Eugenia to suffer Edgar to be entrusted  and consulted: Eugenia decidedly, however, refused Eugenia consent. 'I require no  advice,' cried Eugenia, 'for I am devoted to my uncle's will: to speak then of this  affair would be the most cruel indelicacy, in publishing a conquest which,  since it is rejected, I ought silently, though gratefully, to bury in my own  heart.'  Eugenia then related the history of all that had passed to Eugenia; but solemnly  declared Eugenia would never, to any other human being, but my uncle who should  hereafter be entitled to Eugenia whole heart, betray the secret of the unhappy  Bellamy.
