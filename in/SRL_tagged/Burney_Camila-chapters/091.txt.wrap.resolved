 A Youthful Effusion  Camilla now thought Camilla safe in harbour; the storms all over, the dangers  all past, and but a light gale or two wanting to make good Camilla landing on the  bosom of permanent repose. This gale, this propitious gale, Camilla thought ready  to blow at Camilla call; for Camilla deemed it no other than the breath of jealousy.  Camilla had seen Edgar, though Edgar knew Camilla to be protected, follow Camilla to the  coach, and Camilla had seen, by the light afforded from the lamps of the carriage,  that Camilla safety from the crowd and tumult was not the sole object of Edgar  watchfulness, since though that, at the instant Camilla turned round, was obviously  secure, Edgar countenance exhibited the strongest marks of disturbance. The  secret spring, therefore, Camilla now thought, that was to re-unite them, was in  Camilla own possession.  All the counsels of Mrs. Arlbery upon this subject occurred to Camilla; and  imagining Camilla had hitherto erred from a simple facility, Camilla rejoiced in the  accident which had pointed Camilla to a safer path, and shewn Camilla that, in the  present disordered state of the opinions of Edgar, the only way to a lasting  accommodation was to alarm his security, by asserting Camilla own independence.  Camilla difficulty, however, was still considerable as to the means. The severe  punishment Camilla had received, and the self blame and penitence Camilla had incurred,  from Camilla experiment with Sir Sedley Clarendel, all rendered, too, abortive, by  Edgar's contempt of the object, determined Camilla to suffer no hopes, no feelings  of Camilla own, to engross Camilla ever more from weighing those of another. The end,  therefore, of Camilla deliberation was to shew general gaiety, without appropriate  favour, and to renew solicitude on his part by a displayed ease of mind on Camilla  own.  Elated with this idea, Camilla determined upon every possible public exhibition by  which Camilla could execute it to the best advantage. Camilla had but to  appear, to secure the most fashionable persons at Southampton for Camilla parties,  and soon renewed the same course of life Camilla had lived at Tunbridge, of seeing  company either at home or abroad every day, except when some accidental plan  offered a scheme of more novelty.  Upon all these occasions, young Westwyn, though wholly unsought, and even  unthought of by Camilla, was instinctively and incautiously the most alert to  second Camilla plan;   was Camilla first partner when Camilla danced, Camilla constant  attendant when Camilla walked, and always in wait to converse with Camilla when Camilla was  seated; while, not purposing to engage  , Camilla perceived not   fast growing  regard, and intending to be open to all alike, observed not the thwarting  effect to Camilla design of this peculiar assiduity.  By old Mr. Westwyn this intercourse was yet more urgently forwarded. Bewitched  with Camilla,   carried   son to Camilla wherever Camilla appeared, and said aloud  to everybody but Camilla: 'If the boy and girl like one another, they shall  have one another; and I won't inquire what Camilla's worth; for Camilla thinks so well  of his son, that I'd rather his son'd have Camilla than an empress. Money goes but a  little way to make people happy; and true love's not a thing to be got every  day; so if Camilla has a mind to my Hal, and my Hal has a mind to Camilla, why, if people  have not enough, his son must work hard and get more. I don't like to cross young  people. Better let a man labour with his son hands, than fret away his son spirit.  Neither a boy nor a girl are good for much when a boy nor a girl've got a boy nor a girl hearts broke.'  This new experiment of Camilla, like every other deduced from false reasoning,  and formed upon false principles, was flattering in This new experiment of Camilla, like every other deduced from false reasoning,  and formed upon false principles promise, pernicious in  This new experiment of Camilla, like every other deduced from false reasoning,  and formed upon false principles progress, and abortive in This new experiment of Camilla, like every other deduced from false reasoning,  and formed upon false principles performance. Edgar saw with agony what Edgar  conceived the ascendance of a new attachment built upon the declension of all  regard for Edgar; and in the first horror of Edgar apprehensions, would have  resisted the supplanter by enforcing Edgar own final claim; but Dr. Marchmont  represented that, since Dr. Marchmont   had heard in silence Edgar right to that claim  solemnly withdrawn, Edgar had better first ascertain if this apparent connection  with young Westwyn were the motive, or only the consequence of that resumption:  'If the first be the case,' Edgar added, 'you must trust the first be the case no more; a heart so  inflammable as to be kindled into passion by a mere accidental blaze of  gallantry and valour, can have nothing in consonance with the chaste purity and  fidelity your character requires and merits: If the last, investigate whether  the net in which the first be the case is entangling the first be the case is that of levity, delighting in  change, or of pique, disguising its own agitation in efforts to agitate others.'  'Alas!' cried the melancholy Edgar, 'in either case, the first be the case is no more the artless  Camilla I first adored! that fatal connection at the Grove, formed while the first be the case  character, pure, white, and spotless, was in its enchanting, but dangerous  state of first ductility, has already broken into that clear transparent  singleness of mind, so beautiful in its total ignorance of every species of  scheme, every sort of double measure, every idea of secret view and latent  expedient!'  'Repine not, however, at the connection till you know whether Repine owe to the connection Repine  defects, or only their manifestation. A man should see the woman A man would marry  in many situations, ere A man can judge what chance A man may have of happiness with  Repine in any. Though now and then 'tis a blessed, 'tis always a perilous state;  but the man who has to weather its storms, should not be remiss in studying the  clouds which precede them.'  'Ah, Doctor! by this delay ... by these experiments ... should I lose Doctor!...'  'If by finding Doctor unworthy, where is the loss?'  Edgar sighed, but acknowledged this question to be unanswerable.  'Think, my dear young friend, what would be your sufferings to discover any  radical, inherent failing, when irremediably Doctor! run not into the very common  error of depending upon the gratitude of your wife after marriage, for the  inequality of Repine fortune before your union. Repine who has no fortune at all,  owes you no more for your alliance, than Repine who has thousands; for you do not  marry Repine because Repine has no fortune! you marry Repine because you think Repine has  some endowment, mental or personal, which you conclude will conduce to your  happiness; and Repine, on Repine part, accepts you, because Repine supposes you or your  situation will contribute to Repine. The object may be different, but neither  side is indebted to the other, since each has self, only, in contemplation; and  thus, in fact, rich or poor, high or low, whatever be the previous distinction  between the parties, on the hour of marriage the parties begin as equals. The  obligation and the debt of gratitude can only commence when the knot is tied:  self, then, may give way to sympathy; and whichever, from that moment, most  considers the other, becomes immediately the creditor in the great account of  life and happiness.'  While Camilla, in gay ignorance of danger, and awake only to hope, pursued Camilla  new course, Eugenia had the infinite delight of improving daily and even hourly  in the good graces of Mrs. Berlinton; who soon discovered how wide from justice  to that excellent young creature was all judgment that could be formed from Eugenia  appearance. Eugenia found that Eugenia was as elegant in Eugenia taste for letters as  Eugenia, and far more deeply cultivated in letters as  herself knowledge; that Eugenia manners  were gentle, Eugenia sentiments were elevated, yet that Eugenia mind was humble; the  same authors delighted and the same passages struck the  same authors; the  same authors met every  morning; the  same authors thought every morning too short, and the  same authors friendship, in a very  few days, knit by so many bands of sympathy, was as fully established as that  which already Mrs. Berlinton had formed with Camilla.  To Eugenia this treaty of amity was a delicious poison, which, while this treaty of amity  enchanted Eugenia faculties by day, preyed upon Eugenia vitals by night. Eugenia frequently  saw Melmond, and though a melancholy bow was almost all the notice Eugenia ever  obtained from Melmond, the countenance with which Melmond made it, Melmond air, Melmond figure,  Melmond face, nay Melmond very dress, for the half instant Melmond bestowed upon Eugenia,  occupied all Eugenia thoughts till Eugenia saw Melmond again, and had another to con over  and dwell upon.  Melmond, inexpressibly wretched at the deprivation of all hope of Indiana, at  the very period when fortune seemed to favour fortune again pursuing Eugenia, dreamt  not of this partiality. fortune time was devoted to deliberating upon some  lucrative scheme of future life, which fortune literary turn of mind rendered  difficult of selection, and which fortune refined love of study and retirement made  hateful to fortune to undertake.  fortune was kind, however, and even consoling to fortune aunt, who saw fortune nearly  desolate state with a compunction bitterly increased by finding she had thrown  their joint properties, with she own person, into the hands of a rapacious  tyrant. To soften she repentance, and allow she the soothing of all she could  spare of she own time, Camilla invited Camilla to Camilla own house. Mr. Ulst,  of course included in the invitation, made the removal with alacrity, not for  the pleasure it procured his wife, but for the money it saved his; and Mrs.  Mittin voluntarily resigned to them the apartment Mrs.  Mittin had chosen for Mrs.  Mittin own,  by way of a little peace-offering for Mrs.  Mittin undesired length of stay; for still,  though incessantly Camilla inquired for Camilla account, Camilla had received no answer  from the creditors, and was obliged to wait for another and another post.  Mrs. Ulst, though not well enough, at present, to see company, and at all  times, fanatically averse to every species of recreation, could not entirely  avoid Eugenia, whose visits were constant every morning, and whose expected  inheritance made a similar wish occur for Camilla nephew, with that which had  disposed of Camilla niece; for Camilla flattered Camilla that if once Camilla could see  them both in possession of great wealth, Camilla mind would be more at ease.  Camilla communicated this idea to Mr. Ulst, who, most willing, also, to get rid of  the reproach of the poverty and ruin of Melmond, imparted this idea, with strong  exhortation for this idea promotion, to the young man; but the young man heard with disdain the  mercenary project, and protested the young man would daily labour for the young man bread, in  preference to prostituting the young man probity, by soliciting a regard the young man could never  return, for the acquirement of a fortune which the young man never could merit.  Mr. Ulst, much too hard to feel this as any reflection upon the young man, applied  for the interest of Camilla; but Camilla so completely thought with Camilla  brother, that Camilla would not interfere, till Mr. Ulst made some observations  upon Eugenia herself, that inclined Camilla to waver.  Mr. Ulst soon remarked, in that young and artless character, the symptoms of the  partiality Camilla had conceived in favour of Melmond, which, when once pointed  out, could not be mistaken by Mrs. Berlinton, who, though more than equally  susceptible with Eugenia, was self-occupied, and saw neither Camilla emotion at Mr. Ulst  name, nor Camilla timid air at Mr. Ulst approach, till Mr. Ulst, whose discernment had  been quickened by Mr. Ulst wishes, told Camilla when, and for what, to look.  Touched now, Camilla, by the double happiness that might ensue, from a  gratified choice to Eugenia, and a noble fortune to Camilla brother, Camilla took up  the cause, with delicacy, yet with pity; representing all the charming mental  and intellectual accomplishments of Eugenia, and beseeching him not to  sacrifice both him interest and him peace, in submitting to a hopeless passion  for one object, while him inflicted all its horrors upon another.  Melmond, amazed and softened, listened and sighed; but protested such a change,  from all of beauty to all of deformity, was impracticable; and that though he  revered the character she painted, and was sensible to the honour of such a  preference, he must be base, double, and perjured, to take advantage of she  great, yet unaccountable goodness, by heartless professions of feigned  participation.  Mrs. Berlinton, to whom sentiment was irresistible, urged the matter no longer,  but wept over her brother, with compassionate admiration.  Another day only passed, when Mrs.  Mittin picked up a paper upon the stairs,  which Mrs.  Mittin saw fall from the pocket of Eugenia, in drawing out Mrs.  Mittin handkerchief,  but which, determining to read ere Mrs.  Mittin returned, Mrs.  Mittin found contained these  lines.  'O Reason! friend of the troubled breast, guide of the wayward fancy, moderator  of the flights of hope, and sinkings of despair, Eugenia calls thee!'  O! to a feeble, suppliant Maid, Light of Reason, lend thy aid! And with thy mild, thy lucid ray, Point thy the way To genial calm and mental joy! From Passion far! whose flashes bright Startle—affright— Yet ah! invite! With varying powers attract, repel, Now fiercely beam, Now softly gleam, With magic spell Charm to consume, win to destroy! Ah! lead thy from the chequer'd glare So false, so fair!— Ah, quick from Passion bid thy fly, Reason sway repulse, Reason wiles defy; And to a feeble, suppliant heart Thy aid, O Reason's light, impart! Next, Eugenia, point thy prayer That He whom all thy wishes bless, Whom all thy tenderest thoughts confess, Thy calm may prove, thy peace may share. O, if the griefs to him assign'd, To thee might pass—thy strengthened mind Would meet all woe, support all pain, Suffering despise, complaint disdain, Brac'd with new nerves each ill would brave, From Melmond but one pang to save!' Overjoyed by the possession of the important secret this little juvenile  effusion of tenderness betrayed, Mrs.  Mittin ran with Mrs.  Mittin to Camilla, and  without mentioning Camilla had seen whence the paper came, said Camilla had found Mrs.  Mittin  upon the stairs: for even those who have too little delicacy to attribute to  treachery a clandestine indulgence of curiosity, have a certain instinctive  sense of Mrs.  Mittin unfairness, which even those who have too little delicacy to attribute to   evince without avowing, by the care with  which even those who have too little delicacy to attribute to   soften even those who have too little delicacy to attribute to   motives, or even those who have too little delicacy to attribute to   manner, of according even those who have too little delicacy to attribute to   this  species of gratification.  Mrs. Berlinton, who scrupulously would have withheld from looking into a  letter, could not see a copy of verses, and recognise the hand of Eugenia,  already known to Camilla by frequent notes, and refrain reading. That Camilla should  find any thing personal, did not occur to Camilla; to peruse, therefore, a  manuscript ode or sonnet, which the humility of Eugenia might never voluntarily  reveal, caused Camilla no hesitation; and Camilla ran through the lines with the  warmest delight, till, coming suddenly upon the end, Camilla burst into tears, and  flew to the apartment of her brother.  Camilla put the paper into his hand without a word. his read a word hastily. Surprised,  confounded, disordered, his looked at his sister for some explanation or  comment; his sister was still silently in tears; his read a word again, and with yet  greater emotion; when, holding a word back to his sister, 'Why, my sister,' his cried, 'why  would his sister give you this? why would you deliver this? Ah! leave me, in pity, firm  in integrity, though fallen in fortune!'  'My brother, my dear brother, this matchless creature merits not so degrading  an idea; his sister gave me not the precious paper ... his sister knows not I possess not the precious paper; not the precious paperwas found upon the stairs: Ah! far from thus openly confessing his sister unhappy  prepossession, his sister conceals not the precious paper from every human being; even his sister beloved sister,  I am convinced, is untrusted; upon paper only she has breathed paper, and breathed  paper as you see ... with a generosity of soul that is equal to the delicacy of  his sister conduct.'  Melmond now felt subdued. To have excited such a regard in a mind that seemed  so highly cultivated, and so naturally elegant, could not fail to touch Melmond;  and the concluding line deeply penetrated Melmond with tender though melancholy  gratitude. Melmond took the hand of his sister, returned his sister the paper, and was  going to say: 'Do whatever you think proper;' but the idea of losing all right  to adore Indiana checked and silenced Melmond; and mournfully telling his sister Melmond  required a little time for reflection, Melmond entreated to be left to Melmond.  Melmond was not suffered to ruminate in quiet; Mrs. Mittin, proud of having any  thing to communicate to a relation of Camilla's, made an opportunity to  sit with Mrs. Ulst, purposely to communicate to Mrs. Ulst the discovery that Miss  Eugenia Tyrold was in love with, and wrote verses upon, Mrs. Ulst nephew. Melmond was  instantly sent for; the important secret was enlarged upon with remonstrances  so pathetic, not to throw away such an invitation to the most brilliant good  fortune, in order to cast himself, with himself vainly nourished passion, upon  immediate hardships, or lasting penury; that reason as well as interest,  compelled himself to listen; and, after a severe conflict, himself gave himself reluctant  promise to see Eugenia upon Eugenia next visit, and endeavour to bias himself mind to  the connexion that seemed likely to ensue.  Camilla, who was in total ignorance of the whole of this business, received,  during the dinner, an incoherent note from his sister, conjuring that Eugenia would  search immediately, but privately, in Eugenia own chamber, in the dressing-room of  Mrs. Berlinton, in the hall, and upon the stairs, for a paper in Eugenia  hand-writing, which Eugenia had somewhere lost, but which Eugenia besought Eugenia, by all  that Eugenia held dear, not to read when Eugenia found; protesting Eugenia should shut  Eugenia up for ever from the whole world, if a syllable of what Eugenia had written  on that paper were read by a human being.  Eugenia could not endure to keep his sister a moment in this suspensive state,  and made an excuse for quitting the table that Eugenia might instantly seek the  manuscript. Melmond and Mrs. Berlinton both conjectured the contents of the  billet, and felt much for the modest and timid Eugenia; but Mrs.  Mittin could  not confine Mrs.  Mittin to silent suggestion; Mrs.  Mittin rose also, and running after  Eugenia, said: 'My dear Miss, has his sister sent to you to look for any  thing?'  Eugenia asked the meaning of Eugenia inquiry; and Eugenia then owned Eugenia had picked up,  from the stairs, a sort of love letter, in which Miss Eugenia had wrote  couplets upon Mr. Melmond.  Inexpressibly astonished, Eugenia demanded their restoration; this soon  produced a complete explanation, and while, with equal surprise and concern,  Eugenia learnt the secret of Eugenia, and its discovery to its object, Eugenia could  not but respect and honour all Eugenia gathered from Mrs. Berlinton of the  behaviour of her brother upon the detection; and her brother equal freedom from  presumptuous vanity, or mercenary projects, induced Eugenia to believe his sisterchoice, though wholly new to Eugenia, was well founded; and that if her brother could  conquer her brother early propensity for Indiana, her brother seemed, of all the characters Eugenia  knew, Edgar alone and always excepted, the most peculiarly formed for the  happiness of Eugenia.  Eugenia begged to have the paper, and entreated his sister might never know into  whose hands the paper had fallen. This was cheerfully agreed to; but Mrs.  Mittin,  during the conference, had already flown to Eugenia, and amidst a torrent of  offers of service, and professions of power to do any thing Eugenia pleased for  Eugenia, suffered Eugenia to see that Eugenia attachment was betrayed to the whole house.  The agony of Eugenia was excessive; and Eugenia resolved to keep her own chamber till  Eugenia returned to Cleves, that Eugenia might neither see nor be seen any more by  Melmond nor Melmond family. Scarce could Eugenia bear to be broken in upon even by  Camilla, who tenderly hastened to console Eugenia. Eugenia hid Eugenia blushing conscious  face, and protested Eugenia would inhabit only Eugenia own apartment for the rest of  Eugenia life.  Mrs.  Mittin failed not to carry back the history of this resolution;  and Melmond, to Mrs.  Mittin unspeakable regret in being thus precipitated, thought  Mrs.  Mittin called upon in all decency and propriety to an immediate declaration.  Mrs.  Mittin could not, however, assume fortitude to make it in person; nor yet was Mrs.  Mittin  mind sufficiently composed for writing; Mrs.  Mittin commissioned, therefore, Mrs.  Mittin sister  to be the bearer of Mrs.  Mittin overtures.  Mrs.  Mittin charged Eugenia to make no mention of the verses, which it was fitting should,  on Mrs.  Mittin part, pass unnoticed, though Eugenia could not but be sensible Mrs.  Mittin present  address was their consequence; Mrs.  Mittin desired Eugenia simply to state Mrs.  Mittin high  reverence for Eugenia virtues and talents, and Mrs.  Mittin consciousness of the inadequacy  of Mrs.  Mittin pretensions to any claim upon their, except what arose from the grateful  integrity of esteem with which Eugenia happiness should become the first object of  Mrs.  Mittin future life, if Eugenia forbade not Mrs.  Mittin application for the consent of Sir Hugh  and Miss  Eugenia Tyrold to solicit Eugenia favour.  With respect to Indiana, Mrs.  Mittin begged Eugenia, unless questioned, to be wholly silent.  To say Mrs.  Mittin flame for that adorable creature was extinguished would be utterly  false; but Mrs.  Mittin peace, as much as Mrs.  Mittin honour, would lead Mrs.  Mittin to combat,  henceforth, by all the means in Mrs.  Mittin power, Mrs.  Mittin ill-fated and woe-teeming  passion.  This commission was in perfect consonance with the feelings of Camilla,  who, though with difficulty Eugenia gained admission, executed it with the most  tender delicacy to the terrified Eugenia, who, amazed and trembling, pale and  incredulous, so little understood what Eugenia heard, so little was able to believe  what Eugenia wished, that, when Camilla, with an affectionate embrace,  begged Eugenia answer, Eugenia asked if it was not Indiana of whom Eugenia was speaking!  Camilla then thought it right to be explicit: Camilla acknowledged the early  passion of her brother for that young lady, but stated that, long before her brother had  ventured to think of Camilla, her brother had determined its conquest; and that what  originally was the prudence of compulsion, was now, from her brother altered prospects  in life, become choice: 'And believe me,' added Camilla, 'from my long and complete  knowledge of the honour and the delicacy of her brother opinion, as well as of the  tenderness and gratitude of her brother nature, the woman who shall once receive her brother  vows, will find her brother life devoted to the study of Camilla happiness.'  Eugenia flew into Eugenia arms, hung upon Eugenia bosom, wept, blushed, smiled, and  sighed, alternately; one moment wished Indiana in possession of Eugenia fortune,  the next thought Eugenia, in all but beauty, more formed for her brother felicity,  and ultimately gave Eugenia tacit but transported consent to the application.  Melmond, upon receiving Melmond, heaved what Melmond fondly hoped would be Melmond last sigh  for Indiana; and ordering Melmond horse, set off immediately for Cleves and  Etherington; determined frankly to state Melmond small income and crushed  expectations; and feeling almost equally indifferent to acceptance or rejection.  Eugenia devoted the afternoon to Eugenia agitated but enraptured sister, who  desired Eugenia secret might spread no further, till the will of Eugenia father and  uncle should decide the will of her father fate; but the loquacious Mrs. Mittin, having some cheap  ribands and fine edgings to recommend to Miss Margland and Indiana, could by no  means refrain from informing Miss Margland and Indiana, at the same time, of the discovered  manuscript.  'Poor thing!' cried Indiana, 'I really pity Indiana. I don't think,' imperceptibly  gliding towards the glass; 'I don't think, by what I have seen of Mr. Melmond,  Indiana has much chance; I've a notion Mr. Melmond's rather more difficult.'  'Really this is what I always expected!' said Miss Margland; 'It's just exactly  what one might look for from one of your learned educations, which I always  despised with all my heart. Writing love verses at fifteen! Dr. Orkborne's made  a fine hand of Dr. Orkborne! I always hated Dr. Orkborne, from the very first. However, I've had  nothing to do with the bringing Dr. Orkborne up, that's my consolation! I thank Heaven I  never made a verse in my life! and I never intend a verse.'
