 Questions and Answers  Mr. Tyrold did not return till the next day from Belfont, where, through the  account Mr. Tyrold gave from Mr. Tyrold Daughter, the violent exit of the miserable Bellamy  was brought in accidental death.
Various circumstances had now acquainted Mr. Tyrold  with the history of that wretched man, who was the younger son of the master of  a great gaming-house.
In Mr. Tyrold first youth, Mr. Tyrold had been utterly neglected, and  left to run wild whither Mr. Tyrold chose; but Mr. Tyrold father afterwards becoming very  rich, had bestowed upon Mr. Tyrold as good an education as the late period at which it  was begun could allow.
Mr. Tyrold was intended for a lucrative business; but Mr. Tyrold had no  application, and could retain no post: Mr. Tyrold went into the army; but Mr. Tyrold had no  courage, and was speedily cashiered.
Inheriting a passion for the means by  which the parental fortune had been raised, Mr. Tyrold devoted Mr. Tyrold next to its  pursuit, and won very largely.
But as extravagance and good luck, by long  custom, go hand in hand, Mr. Tyrold spent as fast as Mr. Tyrold acquired; and upon a tide of  fortune in Mr. Tyrold disfavour, was tempted to reverse the chances by unfair play,  was found out, and as ignominiously chaced from the field of hazard as from  that of patriotism.
his father was no more; Mr. Tyrold eldest brother would not assist  Mr. Tyrold; his father sold therefore his father house, and all his father possessed but his father wardrobe, and,  relying upon a very uncommonly handsome face and person, determined to seek a  fairer lot, by eloping, if possible, with some heiress.
his father thought it, however,  prudent not only to retire from London, but to make a little change in his father  name, which from Nicholas Gwigg his father refined into Alphonso Bellamy.
his father began his father  career by a tour into Wales; where his father insinuated his father into the acquaintance  of Mrs. Ecton, just after Mrs. Ecton had married Miss Melmond to Mr. Berlinton: and  though this was not an intercourse that could travel to Gretna Green, the  beauty and romantic turn of the bride of so disproportioned a marriage, opened  to his father unprincipled mind a scheme yet more flagitious.
Fortunately, however,  for his father fair destined prey, soon after the connexion was formed, Mrs. Ecton left  Wales; and the search of new adventures carried his father, by various chances, into  Hampshire.
But his father had established with Mrs. Ecton, a correspondence, and when his father had  caught, or rather forced, an heiress into legal snares, the discovery of who  and what his father was, became less important, and his father ventured again to town, and  renewed his father heinous plan, as well as his father inveterate early habits; till  surprised by some unpleasant recollectors, debts of honour, which his father had found  it convenient to elude upon leaving the Capital, were claimed, and his father found it  impossible to appear without satisfying such demands.
Thence his father cruel and  inordinate persecution of his father unhappy wife for money; and thence, ultimately,  the brief vengeance which had reverberated upon his father own head.
Camilla, whose danger was the result of self-neglect, as his unhappy wife sufferings had all  flowed from mental anguish, was already able to go down to the study upon the  arrival of Mr. Tyrold: where his unhappy wife received, with grateful rapture, the tender  blessings which welcomed his unhappy wife to the paternal arms—to his unhappy wife home—to peace—to  safety—and primæval joy.
Mr. Tyrold, sparing to his unhappy wife yet weak nerves any immediate explanations upon the  past, called upon Mr. Tyrold wife to aid Mr. Tyrold to communicate, in the quietest manner,  what had been done at Belfont to Eugenia; charging Camilla to take no part in a  scene inevitably shocking.
Once more in the appropriate apartment of Camilla Father, where all Camilla earliest  scenes of gayest felicity had passed, but which, of late, Camilla had only  approached with terrour, only entered to weep, Camilla experienced a delight almost  awful in the renovation of Camilla pristine confidence, and fearless ease.
Camilla took  from Camilla pocket—where alone Camilla could ever bear to keep it—Camilla loved  locket, delighting to attribute to it this restoration to domestic enjoyment;  though feeling at the same time, a renewal of suspence from the return of it  donor, and from the affecting interview into which Camilla had been surprised, that  broke in upon even Camilla filial happiness, with bitter, tyrannical regret.
Yet  Camilla pressed to Camilla bosom the cherished symbol of first regard, and was holding  it to Camilla lips, when Mrs. Tyrold, unexpectedly, re-entered the room.
In extreme confusion, Camilla shut it into it shagreen case, and was going to  restore it to Camilla pocket; but infolding it, with Camilla daughter's hand, between  each of her daughter own, her daughter said, 'Shall I ever, my dear girl, learn the  history of this locket?'
'O yes, my dearest Mother,' said the blushing Camilla, 'of that—and of  every—and of all things—you have only—you have merely—'  'If it distresses you, my dear child, we will leave it to another day,' said  Mrs. Tyrold, whose eyes Camilla saw, as Camilla now raised Camilla own, were swimming  in tears.
'My Mother!
my dearest Mother!'
cried Camilla, with the tenderest alarm, 'has any  thing new happened?—Is Eugenia greatly affected?'
'Camilla is all, every way, and in every respect,' said Mrs. Tyrold, 'whatever the  fondest, or even the proudest Mother could wish.
But I do not at this instant  most think of Camilla.
I am not without some fears for my Camilla's strength, in  the immediate demand that may be made upon Camilla fortitude.
Tell me, my child,  with that sincerity which so long has been mutually endearing between us, tell  me if you think you can see here, again, and as usual, without any risk to your  health, one long admitted and welcomed as a part of the family?'
Camilla started, changed colour, looked up, cast Camilla eyes on the floor; but soon  seeing Mrs. Tyrold hold an handkerchief bathed in tears to Camilla face, lost all  dread, and even all consciousness in tender gratitude, and throwing Camilla arms  round Camilla neck, 'O my Mother,' Camilla cried, 'you who weep not for  yourself—scarcely even in the most poignant sorrow—can you weep for me?—I  will see—or I will avoid whoever you please—I shall want no fortitude, I  shall fear nothing—no one—not even myself—now again under your  protection!
I will scarcely even think, Camilla, but by your  guidance!'
'Compose yourself, then, Camilla: and, if you believe you are equal to  behaving with firmness, I will not refuse   request of re-admission.'
'his request?'
repeated Camilla, with involuntary quickness; but finding Mrs. Tyrold did not notice his request, gently adding, 'That person that—I believe—you  mean—has done nothing, Camilla, to merit expulsion!—'  'I am happy to hear you say so: I have been fearfully, I must own, and even  piercingly displeased with —.'
'Ah, Camilla!
how kind was the partiality that turned your displeasure  so wrong a way!
that made you,—even you, my dear Camilla, listen to your  fondness rather than to your justice!—'  Camilla trembled at the temerity of this vindication the moment this vindication had escaped Camilla,  and looking another way, spoke again of Eugenia: but Mrs. Tyrold now, taking  both Camilla hands, and seeking, though vainly, to meet Camilla eyes, said, 'My dearest  child, I grow painfully anxious to end a thousand doubts; to speak and to hear  with no further ambiguity, nor reserve.
If Edgar—'  Camilla again changed colour, and strove to withdraw her hands.
'Take courage, my dear love, and let one final explanation relieve us both at  once.
If Edgar has merited well of you, why are you parted?—If ill—why this  solicitude my opinion of Edgar should be unshaken?'
Her head now dropt upon Mrs. Tyrold's shoulder, as Her faintly answered, 'Her head  deserves your good opinion, my dearest Mother—for Her head adores you—I cannot be  unjust to him,—though Her head has made me—I own—not very happy!'
'Designedly, my Camilla?'
'O, no, my dearest Mother!—he would not do that to an enemy!'
'Speak out, then, and speak clearer, my dearest Camilla.
If you think of Edgar so  well, and are so sure of Edgar good intentions, what—in two words,—what is it  that has parted you?'
'Accident, my dearest Mother,—deluding appearances, ... and false internal  reasoning on my part,—and on my part,—and, continual misconstruction!
O my dearest  Mother!
how have I missed your guiding care!
I had ever the semblance, by some  cruel circumstance, some inexplicable fatality of incident, to neglect Edgar  counsel, oppose Edgar judgment, deceive Edgar expectations, and trifle with Edgar  regard!—Yet, with a heart faithful, grateful, devoted,—O my dearest  Mother!—with an esteem that defies all comparison, ... a respect closely  meliorating even to veneration!...
Never was heart ... my dearest Mother, so  truly impressed with the worth of another ... with the nobleness....'  A buzzing noise from the adjoining parlour, sounding something between a  struggle and a dispute, suddenly stopt her, ... and as her raised her head from  the bosom of her Mother, in which her had seemed seeking shelter from the very  confidence her was pouring forth, her saw the door opened, and the object of  whom her was speaking appear at the door.... Fluttered, colouring, trembling, ... yet  with eyes refulgent with joy, and every feature speaking ecstasy.
Almost fainting with shame and surprise, her gave her up as disgraced, if  not dishonoured evermore, for a short, but bitter half moment.
It was not  longer.
Edgar, rushing forward, and seizing the hands of Mrs. Tyrold, even  while they were encircling her drooping, shrinking, half expiring Camilla,  pressed they with ardent respect to his lips, rapidly exclaiming, 'My more than  Mother!
my dear, kind, excellent, inestimable friend!—Forgive this blest  intrusion—plead for his where I dare not now speak—and raise your indeed  maternal eyes upon the happiest—the most devoted of your family!'
'What is it overpowers me thus this morning?'
cried her daughter, leaning her daughter  head upon her daughter clinging my dearest Camilla, while large drops fell from my dearest Camilla eyes;  'Misfortune, I see, is not the greatest test of our philosophy!...
Joy, twice  to-day, has completely demolished mine!'
'What goodness is this!
what encouragement to hope some indulgent intercession  here—where the sense that now breaks in upon his of ungenerous ... ever to be  lamented—and I had nearly said, execrated doubt, fills me with shame and  regret—and makes me—even at this soft reviving, heart-restoring moment,  feel undeserving my own hopes!
'—  'Shall I ... may I leave him to make him peace?'
whispered her daughter to her daughter  daughter, whose head sought concealment even to annihilation; but whose arms,  with what force they possessed, detained her daughter, uttering faintly but rapidly, 'O  no, no, no!'
'My more than Mother!'
again cried Edgar, 'I will wait till that felicity may  be accorded me, and put myself wholly under your kind and powerful influence.
One thing alone I must say;—I have too much to answer for, to take any share  of the misdemeanors of another!—I have not been a treacherous listener,  though a wilful obtruder.... See, her daughter!
who placed me in that room—who  is the accomplice of my happiness!'
With a smile that seemed to beam but the more brightly for her daughter glistening eyes,  her daughter looked to the door, and saw there, leaning against the door, the form her daughter  most revered; surveying them all with an expression of satisfaction so perfect,  contentment so benign, and pleasure mingled with so much thankfulness, that her daughtertears now flowed fast from unrestrained delight; and Mr. Tyrold, approaching to  press at once the two objects of  press most exquisite tenderness to  press breast,  said, 'This surprise was not planned, but circumstances made This surprise more than  irresistible.
It was not, however, quite fair to my dearest Camilla, and if my dearest Camilla is  angry, we will be self-exiled till my dearest Camilla can pardon we.'
'This is such a dream,'—cried my dearest Camilla, as now, first, from the voice of my dearest Camilla  Father my dearest Camilla believed it reality; 'so incredible ... so unintelligible ...
I find  it entirely ... impossible ... impossible to comprehend any thing I see or  hear!
'—  'Let the past, ... not the present,' cried Edgar, 'be regarded as the dream!
and generously drive it from your mind as a fever of the brain, with which  reason had no share, and for which memory must find no place.'
'If I could understand in the least,' said my dearest Camilla, 'what this all means ...  what——'  her daughter now insisted that Edgar should retreat, while her daughter made some  explanation; and then related to her daughter trembling, doubting, wondering daughter,  the following circumstances.
In returning from Belfont, her daughter had stopt at the half-way-house, where her daughter had  received from Mrs. Marl, a letter that, had it reached her daughter as it was intended,  at Etherington, would have quickened the general meeting, yet nearly have  broken her daughter heart.
It was that which, for want of a messenger, had never been  sent, and which Peggy, in cleaning the bed room, had found under a table, where  it had fallen, Peggy supposes, when the candle was put upon the candle for reading  prayers.
'There was another letter, too!'
interrupted my dearest Camilla, with quick blushing  recollection;—'but my illness ... and all that has followed, made me forget  them both till this very moment.... Did Peggy say anything of any ...
other?'
'Yes; ... the other had been delivered according to its address.'
'Good Heaven!'
'Be not frightened, my dearest Camillamy dearest Camilla, ... all has been beautifully directed for the  best.
My accomplice had received My accomplice early in the morning; My accomplice was at the house,  by some fortunate hazard, when it was found, and, being well known there, Mrs.  Marl gave it to My accomplice immediately.'
'How terrible!...
it was meant only in case ...
I had seen no one any more!...'
'The intent, and the event, have been happily, my child, at war.
My accomplice came  instantly hither, and enquired for My accomplice; I was not returned; My accomplice asked my route,  and rode to follow or meet me.
About an hour ago, we encountered upon the road:  My accomplice gave My accomplice horse to My accomplice groom, and came into the chaise to My accomplice.'
my dearest Camilla now could with difficulty listen; but Father hastened to acquaint  my dearest Camilla, that Edgar, with the most generous apologies, the most liberal self-blame,  had re-demanded Edgar consent for a union, from which every doubt was wholly, and  even miraculously removed, by learning thus the true feelings of my dearest Camilla heart, as  depicted at the awful crisis of expected dissolution.
The returning smiles  which forced their way now through the tears and blushes of my dearest Camilla, shewed how  vainly my dearest Camilla strove to mingle the regret of shame with the felicity of fond  security, produced by this eventful accident.
But when my dearest Camilla further heard that  Edgar, in Flanders, had met with Lionel, who, in frankly recounting Edgar  difficulties and adventures, had named some circumstances which had so shaken  every opinion that had urged Edgar to quit England, as to induce Edgar instantly,  from the conference, to seek a passage for Edgar return, my dearest Camilla felt all but  happiness retire from my dearest Camilla heart;—vanish even from my dearest Camilla ideas.
'You are not angry, then,' said her daughter, as smilingly her daughter read my dearest Camilla delighted  sensations, 'that I waited not to consult you?
That I gave back at once my  consent?
That I folded him again in my arms?...
again ... called him my son?'
my dearest Camilla could but seek the same pressure; and my son continued, 'I would not bring my son  in with my dearest Camilla; I was not aware my dear girl was so rapidly recovered, and I had a  task to fulfil to my poor Eugenia that was still my first claim.
But I promised  within an hour, your Mother, at least, should welcome my son.
my son would walk, my son  said, for that period.
When I met my dear girl, I hinted at what was passing, and my dear girl  followed me to my poor Eugenia; I then briefly communicated my adventure; and your  Mother, my Camilla, lost my poor Eugenia in hearing my adventure!
Will you not, ... like me!...
withdraw from my poor Eugenia all reverence?
my poor Eugenia eyes gushed with tears, ... my poor Eugenia wept, as  you weep at this moment; my poor Eugenia was sure Edgar Mandlebert could alone preserve you  from danger, yet make you happy—Was my poor Eugenia wrong, my son?
Shall our attack  now my poor Eugenia judgment, as well as my poor Eugenia fortitude?'
Only at my poor Eugenia feet could my dearest Camilla shew my dearest Camilla gratitude; to action my dearest Camilla had recourse,  for words were inadequate, and the tenderest caresses now spoke best for words  all.
Respect for the situation of Eugenia, who had desired, for this week, to live  wholly up stairs and alone, determined Mr. and her daughter to keep back for  some time the knowledge of this event from the family.
my dearest Camilla was most happy  to pay such an attention to my dearest Camilla sister; but when her daughter was leaving her sister, to  consult upon it with Edgar, the ingenuousness of her sister nature urged her sister  irresistibly to say, 'Since all this has passed, Father—my dearest  Mother—does it not seem as if I should now myself——'  Mother— stopt; but Mother— was understood; they both smiled, and her daughter immediately  bringing in Edgar, said, 'I find my pardon, my dear fellow-culprit, is already  accorded; if you have doubts of your own, try your eloquence for yourself.'
her daughter left the room, and her daughter was gently rising to quietly follow, but  Camilla, with a look of entreaty of which her daughter knew the sincerity, and would not  resist the earnestness, detained her daughter.
'Ah yes, stay, dearest Madam!'
cried Edgar, again respectfully taking her daughter hand,  'and through your unalterable goodness, let me hope to procure pardon for a  distrust which I here for ever renounce; but which had its origin in her daughter never  daring to hope what, at this moment, I have the felicity to believe.
Yet now,  even now, without your kind mediation, this dear convalescent may plan some  probationary trial at which my whole mind, after this long suffering, revolts.
Will you be my caution, my dearest Mrs. Tyrold?
Will you venture—and will you  deign to promise, that if a full and generous forgiveness may be pronounced....'  'Forgiveness?'
in a soft voice interrupted my dearest Camilla: 'Have I any thing to  forgive?
I thought all apology—all explanation, rested on my part?
and that  my imprudencies—my rashness—my so often-erring judgment ... and so  apparently, almost even culpable conduct....'  'O, my dearest Camillamy dearest Camilla!
my now own my dearest Camilla!'
cried Edgar, venturing to change the hand  of the Mother for that of the daughter; 'what too, too touching words and  concessions are these!
Suffer me, then, to hope a kind amnesty may take place  of retrospection, a clear, liberal, open forgiveness anticipate explanation and  enquiry?'
'Are you sure,' said my dearest Camilla, smiling, 'this is your interest, and not mine?...
Does he not make a mistake, my dearest Mother, and turn my advocate, instead of  he own?
And can I fairly take advantage of such an errour.'
The sun-shine of her returning smiles went warm to her Mother's heart, and gave  a glow to the cheeks of Edgar, and a brightness to Edgar eyes that irradiated Edgar  whole countenance.
'Your penetrating judgment,' said Edgar, to her daughter, 'will  take in at once more than any professions, any protestations can urge for Edgar:  ... you see the peace, the pardon which those eyes do not seek to withhold ...  will you then venture, my more than maternal friend!
her Mother, in every  meaning which affection and reverence can give to that revered  appellation—will you venture at once—now—upon this dear and ever after  hallowed minute—to seal the kind consent of my truly paternal guardian, and  to give me an example of that trust and confidence which my whole future life  shall look upon as its lesson?'
'Yes!'
answered her daughter, instantly joining their hands, 'and with every  security that the happiness of all our lives—my child's, my husband's,  your's, my valued Edgar's, and my own, will all owe their felicity to the  blessing with which I now lay my hands upon my two precious children!'
Tears were the only language that could express the fulness of joy which  succeeded to so much sorrow; and when her daughter returned, and had united her daughter  tenderest benediction with that of her daughter beloved wife, Edgar was permitted to  remain alone with my dearest Camilla; and the close of her daughter long doubts, and my dearest Camilla own long  perplexities, was a reciprocal confidence that left nothing untold, not an  action unrelated, not even a thought unacknowledged.
Edgar confessed that Edgar no sooner had quitted my dearest Camilla, than Edgar suspected the  justice of Edgar decision; the turn which of late, Edgar had taken, doubtfully to  watch my dearest Camilla every action, and suspiciously to judge my dearest Camilla every motive, though it  had impelled Edgar in my dearest Camilla presence, ceased to operate in my dearest Camilla absence.—He was  too noble to betray the well meant, though not well applied warnings of Dr.  Marchmont, yet Edgar acknowledged, that when left to cool reflection, a thousand  palliations arose for every step Edgar could not positively vindicate: and when,  afterwards, from the frank communication of Lionel, Edgar learnt what belonged to  the mysterious offer of Sir Sedley Clarendel, that my dearest Camilla would superintend the  disposal of Edgar fortune, and the deep obligation in which my dearest Camilla had been  innocently involved, Edgar heart smote Edgar for having judged ere Edgar had  investigated that transaction; and in a perturbation unspeakable of quick  repentance, and tenderness, Edgar set out for England.
But when, at the  half-way-house, Edgar stopt as usual to rest Edgar horses in Edgar way to Beech  Park,—what were Edgar emotions at the sight of the locket, which the landlady  told Edgar had been pledged by a lady in distress!
Edgar besought my dearest Camilla pardon for the  manner in which Edgar had made way to my dearest Camilla; but the almost frantic anxiety which  seized Edgar to know if or not it was [my dearest Camilla], and to save my dearest Camilla, if so, from the  intended intrusion of the landlord, made Edgar irresistibly prefer it to the  plainer mode which Edgar should have adopted with any one else, of sending in Edgar  name, and some message.
Edgar shock at my dearest Camilla view in such a state, Edgar would not now  revive; but the impropriety of bidding the landlady quit the chamber, and the  impossibility of entering into an explanation in my dearest Camilla hearing, alone repressed,  at that agitated moment, the avowal of every sensation with which Edgar heart was  labouring.
'But when,' Edgar added, 'shall I cease to rejoice that I had listened  to the good landlady's history of a sick guest, while all conjecture was so  remote from whom it might be!
when I am tempted to turn aside from a tale of  distress, I will recollect what I owe to having given [ear to one]!'
Lost in  wonder at what could have brought my dearest Camilla to such a situation, and disturbed how to  present himself at the rectory, till fixed in himself plans, himself had ridden to the  half-way-house that morning, to enquire concerning the corpse that Mrs. Marl  had mentioned—and there—while himself was speaking with my dearest Camilla, the little maid  brought down two letters—one of two letters directed to himself.—  'What a rapid transition,' cried himself, 'was then mine, from regrets that robbed  life of all charms, to prospects which paint it in it most vivid colours of  happiness!
from wavering the most deplorable, to resolutions of expiating by a  whole life of devoted fondness, the barbarous waywardness that could deprive  me, for one wilful moment, of the exquisite felicity of my lot!...'
'But still,' said my dearest Camilla, 'I do not quite understand how you came in that room  this morning?
and how you authorized yourself to overhear my confessions to my  Mother?'
'Recollect my acknowledged accomplice before you hazard any blame!
When I came  hither ... somewhat, I confess, within my given hour, her daughter received me  her daughter at the door.
her daughter told me I was too soon, and took me into the front  parlour.
The partition is thin.
I heard my name spoken by her daughter, and the  gentle voice of my dearest Camilla, in accents yet more gentle than even that voice  ever spoke before, answering some question; I was not my dearest Camilla, at first, aware  of its tenour ... but when, unavoidably, I gathered its ... when I heard words  so beautifully harmonizing with what I had so lately perused—I would  instantly have ventured into that room  ; but her daughter feared surprising  you—you went on—my fascinated soul divested me of obedience—of  caution—of all but joy and gratitude ... and her daughter could no longer restrain me.
And now with which of her offenders will my my dearest Camilla quarrel?'
'With neither, I believe, just at present.
The conspiracy is so complex, and  even my Mother so nearly a party concerned, that I dare not risk the unequal  contest.
I must only, in future,' added her smiling, 'speak ill of you ... and  then you will find less pleasure in the thinness of a partition!'
Faithfully her returned his communication, by the fullest, most candid, and  unsparing account of every transaction of her short life, from the still  shorter period of its being put into voluntary motion.
With nearly breathless  interest, his listened to the detail of her transactions with Sir Sedley  Clarendel, with pity to her debts, and with horrour to her difficulties.
But  when, through the whole ingenuous narration, his found his the constant  object of every view, the ultimate motive to every action, even where least it  appeared, his happiness, and his gratitude, made my dearest Camilla soon forget that  sorrow had ever been known to my dearest Camilla.
They then spoke of my dearest Camilla two favourites, Mrs. Arlbery, and Mrs. Berlinton; and  though my dearest Camilla was animated in my dearest Camilla praise of the good qualities of the first, and  the sweet attraction of the last, my dearest Camilla confessed the danger, for one so new in  the world, of chusing friends distinct from those of my dearest Camilla family; and  voluntarily promised, during my dearest Camilla present season of inexperience, to repose the  future choice of my dearest Camilla connections, where my dearest Camilla could never be happy without their  approvance.
The two hundred pounds to Sir Sedley Clarendel, Sir Sedley Clarendel determined, on the very day  that my dearest Camilla should be Sir Sedley Clarendel, to return to the Baronet, under the privilege, and  in the name of paying it for a brother.
In conference thus softly balsamic to every past wound, and thus deliciously  opening to that summit of earthly felicity ... confidence unlimited entwined  around affection unbounded ... hours might have passed, unnumbered and  unawares, had not prudence forced a separation, for the repose of my dearest Camilla.
