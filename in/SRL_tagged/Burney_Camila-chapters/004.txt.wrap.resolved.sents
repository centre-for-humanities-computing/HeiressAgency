 Studies of a grown Gentleman  When the tumult of this affair subsided, Mr. Tyrold and his family prepared to  re-establish Mr. Tyrold and his family at Etherington; and Mrs. Tyrold, the great inducement  for the separation being over, was earnest to take home again the disinherited  Camilla.
Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in the disinherited  Camilla sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition; yet Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition spent the day  of the disinherited  Camilla departure in groans and penitence.
Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition thought it right, however, to  detain Eugenia, who, as Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition decided heiress, was left to be brought up at  Cleves.
The loss of the amusing society of Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition favourite; the disappointment Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition had  inflicted upon her, and the sweetness with which her had borne it, preyed  incessantly upon Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition spirits; and Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition knew not how to employ Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition, which way  to direct Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition thoughts, nor in what manner to beguile one moment of Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition time,  after the children were gone to rest.
The view of the constant resources which Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition brother found in literature,  augmented Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition melancholy at Sir Hugh, whose pleasure in her sight was how embittered by regret and  remorse, had not courage to make the smallest opposition own imperfections; and the steady industry with  which Mr. Tyrold, in early youth, had attained them, and which, while devoted  to field sports, his brother had often observed with wonder and pity, his brother now looked back  to with self-reproach, and recognised in its effect with a reverence almost  awful.
his brother imagination, neither regulated by wisdom, nor disciplined by experience,  having once taken this turn, his brother soon fancied that every earthly misfortune  originated in a carelessness of learning, and that all his brother wished, and all his brother  wanted, upbraided his brother with his brother ignorance.
If disease and pain afflicted his brother, his brother  lamented the juvenile inattention that had robbed his brother of acquirements which  might have taught his brother not to regard disease and pain afflicted him; if the word scholar was named in the word scholar  presence, his brother heaved the deepest sigh; if an article in a newspaper, with which  his brother was unacquainted, was discussed, his brother reviled his brother early heedlessness of study;  and the mention of a common pamphlet, which was unknown to his brother, gave his brother a  sensation of disgrace: even inevitable calamities his brother attributed to the  negligence of his brother education, and construed every error, and every evil of his brother  life, to his brother youthful disrespect of Greek and Latin.
Such was the state of his brother mind, when his brother ordinary maladies had the serious  aggravation of a violent fit of the gout.
In the midst of the acute anguish, and useless repentance, which now  alternately ravaged his brother happiness, it suddenly occurred to his brother, that, perhaps,  with proper instruction, his brother might even yet obtain a sufficient portion of this  enviable knowledge, to enable his brother to pass his brother evenings with some similarity to  his brother brother.
Revived by this suggestion, his brother sent for Mr. Tyrold, to communicate to Mr. Tyrold his brother  idea, and to beg his brother would put his brother into a way to recover his brother lost time, by  recommending to his brother a tutor, with whom his brother might set about a course of  studies:—'Not that I want,' cried his brother, 'to make any particular great figure as  a scholar; but if I could only learn just enough to amuse me at odd hours, and  make me forget the gout, it's as much as I desire.'
The total impossibility that such a project should answer such a project given purpose,  deterred Mr. Tyrold from listening to Mr. Tyrold request.
The mild philosophy of  Mr. Tyrold character saw whatever was lenient to human sufferings as eligible, and  looked no further for any obstacles to the wishes of another, than to  investigate if their gratification would be compatible with innocence.
his character  wrote, therefore, to a college associate of his character younger years, whom his character knew to  be severely embarrassed in his character affairs, and made proposals for settling his character in  the house of his character brother.
These were not merely gratefully accepted by his character old  friend, but drew forth a confession that his character was daily menaced with a public  arrest for debts, which his character had incurred without luxury or extravagance, from  mere ignorance of the value of money, and of œconomy.
In the award of cool reason, to attend to what is impracticable, appears a  folly which no inducement can excuse.
Mrs. Tyrold treated this scheme with  calm, but complete contempt.
Mrs. Tyrold allowed no palliation for a measure of which  the abortive end was glaring; to hearken to it displeased Mrs. Tyrold, as a false  indulgence of childish vanity; and Mrs. Tyrold understanding felt shocked that Mr.  Tyrold would deign to humour Mr.   brother in an enterprise which must inevitably  terminate in a fruitless consumption of time.
Sir Hugh soon, but without anger, saw Mrs. Tyrold disapprobation of Sir Hugh soon plan; Mrs. Tyrold  opinions, from a high superiority to all deceit, were as unreserved as those of  the baronet, from a nature incapable of caution.
Sir Hugh soon told Mrs. Tyrold Sir Hugh soon was sorry to  perceive that Mrs. Tyrold thought Sir Hugh soon should make no proficiency, but entreated Mrs. Tyrold to  take notice there was at least no great presumption in Sir Hugh soon attempt, as Sir Hugh soon meant  to begin with the very beginning, and to go no farther at the first than any  young little school-boy; for Sir Hugh soon should give Sir Hugh soon fair play, by trying Sir Hugh soon  hand with the rudiments, which would no sooner be run over, than the rest would  become plain sailing: 'And if once,' Sir Hugh soon added, 'I should conquer the mastery of  the classics, I shall make but very short work of all the rest.'
Mr. Tyrold saw, as forcibly as Mr. Tyrold wife, the utter impossibility that Sir Hugh  could now repair the omissions of Sir Hugh   youth; but Sir Hugh   was willing to console Sir Hugh    want of knowledge, and sooth Sir Hugh   mortifications; and while Sir Hugh   grieved for Sir Hugh    bodily infirmities, and pitied Sir Hugh   mental repinings, Sir Hugh   considered Sir Hugh   idea as  not illaudable, though injudicious, and in favour of injudicious blamelessness, forgave  injudicious absurdity.
Sir Hugh   was gratified, also, in offering an honourable provision to a man of  learning in distress, whose time and attention could not fail to deserve it, if  dedicated to Sir Hugh   brother, in whatever way whose time and attention might be bestowed.
Sir Hugh   took care to be at Cleves on the day Dr. Orkborne, this gentleman, was  expected, and Sir Hugh   presented Sir Hugh   to Sir Hugh with every mark of regard, as a  companion in whose conversation, Sir Hugh   flattered Sir Hugh  , pain might be lightened,  and seclusion from mixt company cheerfully supported.
Dr. Orkborne expressed Dr. Orkborne gratitude for the kindness of Mr. Tyrold, and  promised to make it Dr. Orkborne first study to merit the high consideration with which  Dr. Orkborne had been called from Dr. Orkborne retirement.
A scholastic education was all that had been given to Dr. Orkborne by Dr. Orkborne  friends; and though in that their hopes were answered, no prosperity followed.
Dr. Orkborne labours had been seconded by industry, but not enforced by talents; and  their soon found how wide the difference between acquiring stores, and bringing  their into use.
Application, operating upon a retentive memory, had enabled Dr. Orkborne  to lay by the most ample hoards of erudition; but these, though these rendered  Dr. Orkborne respectable amongst the learned, proved nearly nugatory in Dr. Orkborne progress  through the world, from a total want of skill and penetration to know how or  where these might turn to any account.
Nevertheless, Dr. Orkborne character was  unexceptionable, Dr. Orkborne manners were quiet, and Dr. Orkborne fortune was ruined.
These were  the motives which induced rather the benevolence than the selection of Mr.  Tyrold to name Mr.   to Mr.   brother, in the hope that, while an asylum at Cleves  would exonerate an asylum at Cleves   from all pecuniary hardships, an asylum at Cleves   very deficiency in  brilliancy of parts, and knowledge of mankind, which though differently  modified, was equal to that of Sir Hugh, would obviate regret of more  cultivated society, and facilitate more  cultivated society reciprocal satisfaction.
The introduction over, Mr. Tyrold sought by general topics to forward their  acquaintance, before any allusion should be made to the professed plan of Sir  Hugh; but Sir Hugh was too well pleased with its ingenuity to be ashamed of its  avowal; Sir Hugh began, therefore, immediately to descant upon the indolence of Sir Hugh  early years, and to impeach the want of timely severity in Sir Hugh instructors:  'For there is an old saying,' Sir Hugh cried, 'but remarkably true, That learning is  better than house or land; which I am an instance of Sir Hugh, for I have house  and land plenty, yet don't know what to do with I have house  and land plenty properly, nor with Sir Hugh  neither, for want of a little notion of things to guide me by.'
his brother, His  added, had been too partial in thinking His already fitted for such a master as  Dr. Orkborne; though Dr. Orkborne promised, notwithstanding Dr. Orkborne time of life, to become  the most docile of pupils, and Dr. Orkborne hoped before long to do no discredit to the  Doctor as Dr. Orkborne tutor.
Mr. Tyrold, whose own benign countenance could scarce refrain from a smile at  this unqualified opening, endeavoured to divert to some other subject the grave  astonishment of Dr. Orkborne, who, previously aware of the age and ill health  of the baronet, naturally concluded the baronet called upon to solace the privacy  of the baronet life by reading or discourse, but suggested not the most distant surmise  the baronet could be summoned as a preceptor.
Sir Hugh, however, far from palliating any design, disguised not even a  feeling; Sir Hugh plunged deeper and deeper in the acknowledgment of Sir Hugh ignorance,  and soon set wholly apart the delicate circumspection of Sir Hugh , by  demanding of Dr. Orkborne what book Sir Hugh thought Sir Hugh had best buy for a beginning?
Receiving from the  Doctor no answer, Sir Hugh good humouredly added, 'Come,  don't be ashamed to name the easiest, for this reason; you must know my plan is  one of my own, which my plan is right to tell you.
As fast as I get on, I intend,  for the sake of remembering my lesson, to send for one of my nephews, and teach  it all over again to one of my nephews one of my nephews; which will be doing service to us all at once.'
Mr. Tyrold now, though for a few moments Mr. Tyrold looked down, thought it best to  leave the matter to it own course, and Dr. Orkborne to Mr. Tyrold own observations;  fully persuaded, that the smiles Sir Hugh might excite would be transient, and  that no serious or lasting ridicule could be attached to Mr. Tyrold character, in the  mind of a worthy man, to whom time and opportunity would be allowed for an  acquaintance with it habitual beneficence.
Mr. Tyrold excused Mr. Tyrold, therefore, from  staying any longer, somewhat to the distress of Dr. Orkborne, but hardly with  the notice of the baronet, whose eagerness in Mr. Tyrold new pursuit completely  engrossed Mr. Tyrold.
Mr. Tyrold late adventure, and Mr. Tyrold new heiress, now tormented Mr. Tyrold no more; Indiana was  forgotten, Camilla but little thought of, and Mr. Tyrold whole mind became exclusively  occupied by this fruitful expedient for retrieving Mr. Tyrold lost time.
Dr. Orkborne, whose life had been spent in any study rather than that of human  nature, was so little able to enter into the character of Sir Hugh, that  nothing less than the respect Mr. Tyrold knew to be due to Mr. Tyrold, could have saved  Mr. Tyrold, upon Mr. Tyrold first reception, from a suspicion that Mr. Tyrold had been summoned in  mere mockery.
The situation, however, was peculiarly desirable to Mr. Tyrold, and the  experiment, in the beginning, corresponded with the hopes of Mr. Tyrold.
Placed  suddenly in ease and affluence, Dr. Orkborne, with the most profound desire to  please, sought to sustain so convenient a post, by obliging the patron, whom Mr. Tyrold  soon saw it would be vain to attempt improving; while Sir Hugh, in return,  professed Mr. Tyrold the most fortunate of men, that Mr. Tyrold had now met with a scholar  who had the good nature not to despise Mr. Tyrold.
Relief from care thus combining with opportunity, Dr. Orkborne was scarce  settled, ere Dr. Orkborne determined upon the execution of a long, critical, and  difficult work in philology, which Dr. Orkborne had often had in contemplation, but never  found leisure to undertake.
By this means Dr. Orkborne had a constant resource for  Dr. Orkborne; and the baronet, observing that time never hung heavy upon Dr. Orkborne hands,  conceived a yet higher admiration of learning, and felt Dr. Orkborne spirits  proportionably re-animated by the fair prospect of participating in such  advantages.
From this dream, however, Dr. Orkborne was soon awakened; a parcel, by the direction of  Dr. Orkborne, arrived from Dr. Orkborne bookseller, with materials for going to work.
Sir Hugh then sent off a message to the parsonage-house, informing Sir Hugh brother  and Sir Hugh family, that his brother  and his family must not be surprised if his brother  and his family did not see or hear of  Sir Hugh for some time, as Sir Hugh had got his hands quite full, and should be  particularly engaged for a week or two to come.
Dr. Orkborne, still but imperfectly conceiving the extent, either of the plan,  or of the simplicity of Dr. Orkborne new pupil, proposed, as soon as the packet was  opened, that they should read together; but Sir Hugh replied, that Sir Hugh would do  the whole in order, and by no means skip the rudiments.
The disappointment which followed, may be easily imagined; with neither  quickness to learn, nor memory to retain, Sir Hugh aimed at being initiated in the  elements of a dead language, for which youth only can find time and  application, and even youth but by compulsion.
Sir Hugh head soon became confused,  Sir Hugh ideas were all perplexed, Sir Hugh attention was vainly strained, and Sir Hugh  faculties were totally disordered.
Astonished at Sir Hugh own disturbance, which Sir Hugh attributed solely to not getting  yet into the right mode, Sir Hugh laughed off Sir Hugh chagrin, but was steady in Sir Hugh  perseverance; and continued wholly shut up from Sir Hugh family and friends, with a  zeal worthy better success.
Lesson after lesson, however, only aggravated Sir Hugh difficulties, till Sir Hugh  intellects grew so embarrassed Sir Hugh scarce knew if Sir Hugh slept or waked.
Sir Hugh nights  became infected by the perturbation of the day; Sir Hugh health visibly suffered  from the restlessness of both, and all Sir Hugh flattering hopes of new and unknown  happiness were ere long exchanged for despair.
Sir Hugh now sent for Sir Hugh , and desired to speak with Sir Hugh alone; when,  catching Sir Hugh fast by the hand, and looking piteously in Sir Hugh face, 'Do you know,  his brother,' Sir Hugh cried, 'I find Sir Hugh turning out as sheer a blockhead as  ever, for all I have got so many more years over His head than when I began all  this hard jingle jangle before?'
Mr. Tyrold, with greater concern than surprise, endeavoured to re-assure and  console him, by pointing out a road more attainable for reaping benefit from  the presence of Dr. Orkborne, than the impracticable path into which Dr. Orkborne had  erroneously entered.
'Ah!
no, my dear brother,' Dr. Orkborne answered; 'if I don't succeed this way, I am sure  I shall succeed no other; for as to pains, I could not have taken more if I had  been afraid to be flogged once a-day: and that gentleman has done all gentleman can,  too, as far as I know to the contrary.
But I really think whatever's the  meaning of it, there's some people can't learn.'
Then, shaking His head, his added, in a low voice: 'To say the truth, I might as  well have given the truth up from the very first, for any great comfort I found in the truth,  if the truth had not been for fear of hurting that gentleman; however, don't let the  poor gentleman know that; for I've no right to turn his off upon nothing,  merely for the fault of my having no head, which how can his help?'
Mr. Tyrold agreed in the justice of this reflection, and undertook to  deliberate upon some conciliatory expedient.
Sir Hugh heartily thanked Sir Hugh; 'But only in the mean time that you are  thinking,' cried Sir Hugh, 'how shall I bring it about to stop Sir Hugh from coming to me  with all those books for my study?
For, do you know, his brother, because I  asked Sir Hugh to buy me one for my beginning, Sir Hugh sent for a full score?
And when Sir Hugh  comes to me about my lesson, Sir Hugh brings them all upon me together: which is one  thing, for ought I know, that helps to confuse me; for I am wondering all the  while when I shall get through with all the  .
However, say nothing of all this  before the poor gentleman, for fear Sir Hugh should take it as a hint; which might  put Sir Hugh out of heart: for which reason I'd rather take another lesson, Lord  help me!—than vex Sir Hugh.'
Mr. Tyrold promised Mr. Tyrold best consideration, and to see Mr. Tyrold again the next  morning.
But Mr. Tyrold had hardly left Cleves ten minutes, when a man and horse came  galloping after Mr. Tyrold, with a petition that Mr. Tyrold would return without delay.
the baronet received Mr. Tyrold with a countenance renovated with self-complacency.
'I  won't trouble you,' the baronet cried, 'to think any more; for now I have got a plan of  my own, which I will tell you.
Not to throw this good gentleman entirely away,  I intend having a sort of a kind of school set up here in my sick room, and so  to let all my nephews come, and say all my nephews tasks to the baronet in my hearing; and then,  who knows but I may pick up a little amongst all my nephews the baronet, without all this hard  study?'
Mr. Tyrold stated the obvious objections to so wild a scheme; but Mr. Tyrold besought  Mr. Tyrold not to oppose the obvious objections, as there was no other way for Mr. Tyrold to get rid of Mr. Tyrold  tutoring, without sending off Dr. Orkborne.
Mr. Tyrold desired, therefore, that Lionel  might come instantly to Cleves; saying, 'I shall write the baronet to Eton, by the  means of the Doctor, to tell the Master I shall take Clermont entirely home  after the next holidays, for the sake of having Mr. Tyrold study under my own eye.'
Mr. Tyrold then entreated Mr. Tyrold to prepare Dr. Orkborne for Mr. Tyrold new avocation.
Mr. Tyrold, who saw that in this plan the inventor alone could be disappointed,  made no further remonstrance, and communicated the design to Dr. Orkborne; who,  growing now deeply engaged in Dr. Orkborne own undertaking, was perfectly indifferent to  whom or to what Dr. Orkborne occasional attendance might be given.
