 A New View of an old Mansion  Camilla, for some time, bestowed no thought upon what Camilla was doing, nor  whither Camilla was going.
A scene so dreadful as that Camilla now quitted, and a  character of such utter unworthiness as that with which Camilla sister for life was  tied, absorbed Camilla faculties, and nearly broke Camilla heart.
When Camilla stopt, however, at Bagshot, for fresh horses, the obligation of giving  directions to others, made Camilla think of Camilla; and, bewildered with  uncertainty whether the step Camilla took were right or wrong, Camilla regretted Camilla  had not, at least, desired to stay till the answer arrived from Etherington.
Yet Camilla journey had the sanction of Eugenia's concurrence; and Eugenia seemed  to Camilla oracular.
When Camilla came upon the cross road leading from Winchester to Cleves, and felt  Camilla quick approach to the spot so loved yet dreaded, the horses seemed to Camilla  to fly.
Twenty times Camilla called out to the driver not to hurry; who as often  assured Camilla the bad roads prevented any haste; Camilla wanted to form some  appropriate plan and speech for every emergence; but Camilla could suggest none for  any.
Camilla was now at the feet of Camilla Mother, now kissing the hands of Camilla  Father, now embraced again by Camilla fond uncle;—and now rejected by them all.
But while Camilla fancy was at work alternately to soothe and to torture Camilla, the  park lodge met Camilla eyes, with still no resolution taken.
Vehemently Camilla stopt the chaise.
To drive in through the park would call a  general attention, and Camilla wished, ere Camilla arrival were announced, to consult  alone with Lavinia.
Camilla resolved, therefore, to get out of the carriage, and  run by a private path, to a small door at the back of the house, whence Camilla  could glide to the chamber commonly appropriated to Camilla sister.
Camilla told the postillion to wait, and alighting, walked quick and fearfully  towards the  park lodge.
Camilla passed through the park-gate for foot passengers without notice from the  porter.
It was twilight.
Camilla saw no one; and rejoiced in the general vacancy.
Trembling, but with celerity, Camilla 'skimmed,' like Camilla celebrated name-sake, the  turf; and annoyed only by the shadows of the trees, which all, as first they  caught Camilla eye, seemed the precursors of the approach of Mrs. Tyrold, speedily  reached the mansion: but when Camilla came to the little door by which Camilla meant to  enter, Camilla found it fastened.
To the front door Camilla durst not go, from the numerous chances by which Camilla  might surprise some of the family in the hall: and to present Camilla at the  servant's gate would have an appearance degrading and clandestine.
Camilla recollected, at last, the sash-door of a bow-window belonging to a room  that was never occupied but in summer.
Thither Camilla went, and knowing the spring  by which Thither could be opened on the outside, let Camilla into the house.
With steps not to be heard, and scarce breathing, Camilla got thence into a long  stone passage, whence Camilla meant to mount the back stairs.
Camilla was relieved by not meeting anyone in the way, though surprised to hear no  foot-steps about the house, and no voices from any of the apartments.
Cautiously Camilla went on, looking round at every step, to avoid any sudden  encounter; but when Camilla came to the bed-chamber gallery, Camilla saw that the door  of the room of Sir Hugh, by which Camilla must necessarily pass, was wide open.
It was possible he might be in it: Camilla had not courage to pass; Camilla sight, thus  unprepared, after so many heavy evils, might be too affecting for he weak  frame.
Camilla turned short round, and entered a large apartment at the head of the  stairs, called the billiard-room, where Camilla resolved to wait and watch ere Camilla  ventured any further.
she   aspect was to the front of the house; Camilla stole gently to a window, whence  Camilla thought the melancholy of Camilla own mind pervaded the park.
None of Camilla  uncle's horses were in sight; no one was passing to and fro; and Camilla looked  vainly even for the house-dog who ordinarily patrolled before the mansion.
Camilla ventured to bend forwarder, to take a view of the side wings; these,  however, presented not any sight more exhilarating nor more animated.
Nothing  was in motion, no one was visible, not even a fire blazed cheerfulness.
Camilla next strove to catch a glance of the windows belonging to the chamber of  Eugenia; but Camilla sigh, though sad, was without surprise to see their shutters  shut.
Those of Indiana were closed also.
'How mournfully,' cried Camilla, 'is all  changed!
what of virtues are gone with  Eugenia!
what of beauty with Indiana!
the one so constantly interesting!
the other looking always so lovely!
'—  But deeper still was her sigh, since mingled with self-reproach, to perceive  Camilla own chamber also shut up.
'Alas!'
Camilla cried, 'my poor uncle considers us  all as dead to my poor uncle!'
Camilla durst not lean sufficiently forward to examine the  drawing-room, in which Camilla concluded the family assembled; but Camilla observed,  with wonder, that even the library was not open, though even the library was still too light  for candles; and Dr. Orkborne, who usually sat there, from the forgetfulness of  application, was the last to demand the family.
The fear of discovery was now combated by an anxiety to see some one,—any  one, ... and Camilla returned to the passage.
All there was still quiet, and Camilla  hazarded gliding past the open door, though without daring to look into the  room; but when Camilla came to the chamber of Lavinia, which Camilla softly entered,  all was dark, and it was evidently not in present use.
This was truly distressful.
Camilla concluded Camilla sister was returned to  Etherington, and knew not to whom to apply for counsel or mediation.
Camilla no  longer, however, feared meeting Camilla parents, who certainly had not made Camilla  sister quit Cleves without themselves; and, after a little hesitation, relying  upon the ever sure lenity of Camilla uncle, Camilla determined to cast Camilla upon his  kindness: but first to send in a short note, to avoid giving his any surprise.
Camilla returned down the gallery, meaning to apply for pen and ink to the first  person Camilla could find: Camilla could only, Camilla knew, meet with a friend; unless, by  ill fortune, Camilla should encounter Miss Margland, the way to whose apartment Camilla  sedulously shunned.
No longer, however, quite so cautious, Camilla stopt near the chamber of Sir Hugh,  and convinced by the stillness it was empty, could not resist stepping into the  apartment.
It looked despoiled and forsaken.
Nothing was in It wonted order; Nothing  favourite guns hung not over the chimney-piece; the corners of the room were  emptied of Nothing sticks; Nothing great chair was in a new place; no cushions for Nothing  dogs were near the fire; the bedstead was naked.
Camilla now felt petrified; Camilla sunk on the floor, to ejaculate a prayer for Nothing  safety, but knew not how to rise again, for terrour; nor which way next to  turn, nor what even to conjecture.
Thus Camilla remained, till suspense grew worse than certainty, and Camilla forced  Camilla from the room to seek some explanation.
It was possible the whole  family residence might be changed to the back front of the house.
Camilla descended  the stairs with almost equal apprehension of meeting any one or seeing no one.
The stone passage was now nearly dark.
The stone passage was always the first part of the  house that was lighted, as The stone passage windows were small and high: but no preparations  were now making for that purpose.
Camilla went to the house-keeper's room, which  was at the foot of the stairs Camilla had descended.
The door was shut, and Camilla  could not open The door.
Camilla tried repeatedly, but vainly, to be heard by soft taps  and whisperings; no one answered.
Amazed, confounded, Camilla turned slowly another away; not a soul was in sight,  not a sound within hearing.
Every thing looked desolate, all the family seemed  to be vanished.
Insensibly, yet irresistibly, Camilla now moved on towards the drawing-room.
The door was shut.
Camilla hesitated whether or not to attempt The door.
Camilla listened.
Camilla  hoped to catch the voice of Camilla uncle: but all was inviolably still.
This was the only place of assembling in the evening; but her uncle might have  dropt asleep, and Camilla would not hazard startling her uncle with Camilla presence.
Camilla  would sooner go to the hall at once, and be announced in the common way by a  servant.
But what was Camilla astonishment in coming to the hall, to find neither servant,  light nor fire?
and the marble pavement covered with trunks, packing mats,  straw, ropes, and boxes?
Terrified and astonished, Camilla thought Camilla walking  in Camilla sleep.
Camilla could combine no ideas, either good or bad, to account for  such a scene, and Camilla looked at   bewildered and incredulous.
After a long hesitation, spent in wonder rather than thought, Camilla at length  determined to enter the breakfast parlour, and ring the bell: when the distant  sound of a carriage, that was just entering the park, made Camilla shut Camilla  into the drawing-room, hastily, but silently.
It advanced rapidly; Camilla trembled; It was surely, Camilla thought, her Mother.
When It drove up to the portico, and Camilla heard the house-bell ring, Camilla  instinctively barred The door; but finding no one approach to the call, while  the bell was impatiently re-rung, Camilla strong emotions of expectation were  taking Camilla again into the hall: but as Camilla hand was upon the lock of the door,  a light glimmered through the key hole.
Camilla heard some step advancing, and  precipitately drew back.
The door was now opened, and a man enquired for a young lady just come  from Alresford.
'There's no young lady here at all,' was the answer, in the voice of Jacob.
Finding it only her own driver, Camilla ventured out; crying 'O Jacob!
where is my  dear uncle?'
Jacob was, at first, incapable of all answer, through surprise at Camilla strange  appearance; but then said, 'O Miss Camilla!
you'll go nigh to break your good  heart when you knows it all!
But how, you've got into the house is what I can't  guess; but I wish, for my poor master's sake, the house had been before now!'
Horrour crept through every vein of Camilla, in the explanation Camilla awaited of  this fearful mystery.
Camilla motioned to the driver to stay, returned back to the  parlour, and beckoned, for Camilla could not speak, to Jacob to follow Camilla.
When Jacob came, and, shutting The door, was beginning a diffuse lamentation,  eagerness to avert lengthened suspense recovered Camilla , and Camilla  passionately exclaimed: 'Jacob!
in two words, where is my uncle?—Is Jacob well?'
'Why, yes, Miss Camilla, considering—' Jacob began; but Camilla, whose fears had  been fatal, interrupted Jacob with fervent thanksgiving, till Camilla was called back  from joy by the following words:  'Jacob's gone away Miss CamillaCamilla!
gone Lord knows where!
given up all Jacob grand  house-keeping, turned off almost all Jacob poor servants, left this fine place,  to have it let to whoever will hire it, and is going to live, Jacob says, in some  poor little lodging, till Jacob can scrape together wherewithal to pay off every  thing for your papa.'
A thunder-bolt that had instantly destroyed her, would gratefully have been  received, in preference to this speech, by Camilla, who, casting up her hands  and eyes, exclaimed: 'Then am I the most detestable, as well as the most  wretched of human beings!
My Father I have imprisoned!—my Uncle I have turned  from My Father house and home!
and for thee, O my Mother!—this is the reception I  have prepared!'
Jacob tried to console her; but Jacob account was only added torture.
The very instant Jacob told her, that Jacob master had received the news of the  arrest of Mr. Tyrold, Jacob determined upon this violent plan; and though the so  speedy release, through the generosity of Mr. Westwyn, had exceedingly calmed  Jacob first emotions, Jacob would not change Jacob purpose, and protested Jacob would  never indulge Jacob in peace nor comfort more, till Jacob had cleared off their  joint debts; of which Jacob attributed the whole fault to Jacob, from having  lived up to the very verge of Jacob yearly income, when Jacob ought, Jacob said,  considering there were so many young people, to have always kept a few odd sums  at hand for accidents.
'We all did what We all could,' continued Jacob, 'to put Jacob  off from such a thing, but all to no purpose; but if you'd been here, Miss  Camilla, you'd have done more with Jacob than all of We all put together: but Jacob  called Miss Lavinia and all of us up to Jacob, and said to We all, I won't have  nobody tell this to my poor little girl, meaning you, Miss Camilla, till I've  got somewhere settled and comfortable; because of my poor little girl kind heart, says Jacob.'
Tenderness so partial, at so suffering an instant, almost killed Camilla.
'O  Jacob,' Camilla cried, 'where is now my dear generous uncle?
I will follow Jacob in  this chaise (rushing out as Camilla spoke) I will be Jacob servant, Jacob nurse, and  attend Jacob from morning to night!'
Camilla hurried into the carriage as Camilla spoke, and bade Jacob give directions to the  postillion.
But when Camilla heard Jacob was, at present, only at Etherington, whence  Jacob was seeking a new abode, Camilla head drooped, and Camilla burst into tears.
Jacob remained, Jacob said, alone, to take care of all the things, and to shew the  place to such as might come.
Miss Margland had been at the house about three hours ago; and had met Sir  Hugh, who had come over, to give directions about what Sir   would have packed up;  and Sir   had read a letter from Miss Indy that was, and had forgiven Camilla; but Sir    was sore vexed Miss Margland had come without Miss Camilla; only Camilla said Miss  Camilla was at Mrs. Bellamy's, and Camilla did not call, because Camilla thought it  would be better to go back again, and see more about Miss Indy, and so bring  Miss Camilla Camilla next time; so Miss Camilla wheedled Sir   to spare  this chaise again,  and let Miss Camilla go off directly to settle every thing to Miss Indy's mind.
Camilla now repented Camilla had not returned to Mrs. Berlinton's, there,  notwithstanding all objections, to have waited Camilla recall; since there Camilla  parents still believed Camilla, and thence, under the protection of Miss Margland,  would in all probability summon her.
To present Camilla, after this barbarous  aggravation of the calamities Camilla had caused, undemanded and unforgiven at  Etherington, Camilla thought impossible.
Camilla enquired if, by passing the night at  Cleves, Camilla might have any chance of seeing Camilla the next day.
Jacobanswered, no; but that Mr. Tyrold himself, with a gentleman from Winchester,  who thought of hiring the house, were to be there early in the morning to take  a survey of the premises.
A meeting, thus circumstanced, with My Father, at a moment when Jacob came upon  so direful a business, as parting with a place of which Camilla had Camilla  occasioned the desertion, seemed to Camilla insupportable: and Camilla resolved to  return immediately to Belfont, to see there if Camilla answer from Lavinia  contained any new directions; and if not, to again go to London, and await  final commands; without listening ever more to any hopes, projects, or  judgments of Camilla own.
Beseeching Jacob Jacob to pardon Camilla non-payment, with every kind  assurance that Camilla should know all her uncle goodness, her uncle told the postillion  to take her uncle to Belfont.
Jacob could go no further, Jacob said, and that but a foot pace, than to Alresford.
Jacob marvelled, but blessed her uncle, and Camilla, ejaculating, 'Adieu, dear happy  Cleves!'
was driven out of the park.
