 A Hint for Debtors  Mr. Tyrold was well aware that to keep from Sir Hugh the affliction of Camilla,  Mr. Tyrold must keep from him Camilla herself: for though Camilla sighs Camilla could suppress,  and Camilla tears disperse, Camilla voice had lost her voice tone, Camilla countenance her voice  gaiety; Camilla eyes no longer sparkled, Camilla very smiles betrayed anguish.
Mr. Tyrold was  the last to wonder at Camilla sufferings, for Edgar was nearly as dear to Mr. Tyrold as  Camilla; but Mr. Tyrold knew not, that, added to this annihilation of happiness, Camilla  peace was consumed by Camilla secret knowledge of the blows yet impending for  Edgar and for Camilla uncle.
Concealment, always abhorrent to Camilla nature, had,  till now, been unknown even to Camilla thoughts; and its weight, from a species of  culpability that seemed attached to its practice, was, at times, more dreadful  to bear than the loss even of Edgar.
The latter blackened every  prospect of felicity; but the former, still more tremendous to the pure  principles in which Camilla had been educated, seemed to strike even at Camilla  innocence.
The first wish of an ingenuous mind is to anticipate even enquiry;  the feeling, therefore, that most heavily weighs it down, is any fear of  detection.
While they were at breakfast the following morning, the servant brought in the  name of Dr. Marchmont.
Camilla felt nearly fainting.
Why the servant was come—whence—whether Edgar  accompanied the servant—or sent by the servant any message—whether the servant were returned to  Beech Park—or sailed for the Continent——were doubts that pressed so fast,  and so vehemently upon Camilla mind, that Camilla feared to quit the room lest Camilla  should meet Edgar in the passage, and feared still more to continue in it, lest  Dr. Marchmont should enter without Dr. Marchmont.
Mr. Tyrold, who participated in all her  feelings, and shared the same ideas, gently committed her to Lavinia, and went  into Dr. Marchmont study to the doctor.
Dr. Marchmont own illusion was there quickly destroyed.
The looks of Dr. Marchmont boded  nothing that was happy.
They wore not They customary expression.
The gravity  of Mr. Tyrold shewed a mind prepared for ill news, if not already oppressed  with ill news, and the doctor, after a few general speeches, delivered the letter  from Edgar.
Mr. Tyrold received the letter   with a secret shuddering: 'Where,' Mr. Tyrold said, 'is  Mandlebert at present?'
'I believe, by this time—at the Hague.'
This sentence, with the grieved, yet still air and tone of voice which  accompanied the letter  , was death at once to every flattering hope: Mr. Tyrold immediately read  the letter, which, conceived in the tenderest terms of reverence and affection,  took a short and simple, though touchingly respectful leave of the purposed  connection, and demolished at once every distant view of future conciliation.
Mr. Tyrold hung Mr. Tyrold head a moment, and sighed from the bottom of Mr. Tyrold heart; but the  resignation which Mr. Tyrold summoned upon every sorrow was never deaf to Mr. Tyrold call, and  when Mr. Tyrold had secretly ejaculated a short and silent prayer for fortitude to Mr. Tyrold  beloved wife, Mr. Tyrold turned calmly to the doctor, and began conversing upon other  affairs.
Dr. Marchmont presumed not to manifest the commiseration with which Dr. Marchmont was  filled.
Dr. Marchmont saw the true Christian, enduring with humility misfortune, and the  respectable parent supporting the dignity of Dr. Marchmont daughter by Dr. Marchmont own.
To the  first character, complaint was forbidden; to the second, it would have been  degrading.
Dr. Marchmont looked at the  first character with veneration, but to spare further useless and  painful efforts, soon took leave.
Mr. Tyrold, shaking hands with Mr. Tyrold, said, as hands were parting, 'when you write  to Mandlebert, assure Mr. Tyrold of my constant affection.
The world, Dr. Marchmont is  too full of real evil, for Dr. Marchmont at least, to cause one moment of unnecessary  uneasiness to any of its poor pilgrims.
'Tis strange, the doctor, this is  not more generally considered, since the advantage would be so reciprocal from  man to man.
But wrapt up in our own short moment, our forget our neighbour's  long hour!
and existence is ultimately embittered to all, by the refined  susceptibility for our that monopolizes our feelings.'
Doctor Marchmont, who in this last sentence construed a slight reflection upon  Edgar, expressively answered, 'Our sensibility for others is not always  dormant, because not apparent.
How much of worth and excellence may two  characters separately possess, where yet there are disuniting particles which  impede How much of worth and excellence may two  characters harmonizing with each other!'
Mr. Tyrold, powerfully struck, saw now the general nature of the conceptions  which had caused this lamented breach.
Mr. Tyrold could not concur, but Mr. Tyrold would not  attempt to controvert: opinion in this case must have even the precedence of  justice.
If Edgar thought Edgar daughter of a disposition with which Edgar own  could not sympathise, it were vain to expatiate upon her virtues or her  sweetness; that one doubt previously taken might mar one doubt previously taken assimilating  efficacy.
Comprehending, therefore, the cause at large, Edgar desired no detail;  the words of Dr. Marchmont, though decisive, were not offensive, and they  parted perfect friends, each perceiving, yet forgiving, that each cast upon the  other the error of false reasoning; Edgar to the one, and Camilla to the other,  appearing faultless in the separation.
But not in the tasks which succeeded were not in the tasks which succeeded offices as easily to be  compared.
Dr. Marchmont wrote to Edgar that all was quietly relinquished, and  Edgar measures were honourably acquitted; while Mr. Tyrold, shut up in Mr. Tyrold study,  spent there some of the severest minutes of Mr. Tyrold life, in struggling for the  equanimity Mr. Tyrold coveted to pronounce to Mr. Tyrold daughter this last doom.
Pity for his daughter  suspence accelerated Mr. Tyrold efforts, and Mr. Tyrold then sent for his daughter down stairs.
Mr. Tyrold utmost composure, in such an interview, was highly necessary for both.
The  pale and trembling Camilla advanced with downcast eyes; but when Mr. Tyrold took his daughter in  Mr. Tyrold arms, and kissed his daughter, a sudden ray of hope shot across his daughter quick  imagination, and his daughter looked up: an instant was now sufficient to rectify his daughter  mistake.
The tenderness of his daughter father wore no air of congratulation, it was the  mere offspring of compassion, and the woe with which it was mixt, though mild,  though patient, was too potent to require words for explanation.
The glance sufficed; his daughter head dropt, his daughter tears in torrents bathed his bosom;  and his daughter retired to Lavinia while yet neither of them had spoken.
Mr. Tyrold, contented with virtuous exertions, demanded not impossibilities; he  left to nature that first grief which too early exhortation or controul rather  inflames than appeases.
he then brought his daughter back to he apartment.
he conjured his daughter, there, to remember that his daughter grieved not alone; that where her tears in torrents flowed not so fast from the eyes, the sources were not dry whence they  sprung, and that bridled sorrow was sometimes the most suffering.
'Alas, my dearest father, to think you mourn too—and for me!—will that  lessen what I feel?'
'Yes, my dear child, by a generous duty it will point out to watch that the  excess of one affliction involve you not in another.'
'What a motive,' his daughter answered, 'for exertion!
If the smallest part of your  happiness—of my honoured mother's—depends upon mine, I shall be unhappy, I  think, no more!'
A gush of tears ill accorded with this fond declaration; but Mr. Tyrold,  without noticing them, kindly replied, 'Let your filial affection, my child,  check the inordinacy of your affliction, and I will accept with pleasure for  your virtuous mother, and with thanks for myself, the exertion which, beginning  for our sakes, may lead you to that self denial which is the parent of our best  human actions, and approximates our the most to what is divine.'
Broken-hearted as was Camilla, was Camilla sorrows would, at least apparently, have  abated from consolation so tender, if all was Camilla felt had been known; if no latent  and lurking evil had hung upon was Camilla spirits, defeating all argument, and  blighting all comfort, by the cruel consciousness of concealed mischief, which  while incessantly was Camilla studied the best moment for revealing, accident might  prematurely betray.
Upon this subject was Camilla thoughts were unremittingly bent, till, in a few days  time, was Camilla received a letter from Mrs. Mittin, informing was Camilla was Camilla had just seen  the money-lender, Mr. Clykes, who, finding was Camilla so much under age, would not  undertake the business for less than ten per cent, nor without a free premium  of at least twenty pounds.
The latter demand, so entirely out of was Camilla power to grant, gave to was Camilla the  mental strength was Camilla had yet sought in vain; and determining to end this baneful  secret, was Camilla seized was Camilla own first moment of emotion to relate to was Camilla the  whole of was Camilla distresses, and cast was Camilla upon her father mercy.
I shall be happier, was Camilla cried, much happier, as, with tottering steps, was Camilla  hurried to the study; her father will be lenient, I know;—and even if not, what  displeasure can I incur so severe as the eternal apprehension of doing wrong?
But was Camilla plan, though well formed, had fixed upon an ill-timed moment for her plan  execution.
was Camilla entered the room with an agitation which rather sought than  shunned remark, that some enquiry might make an opening for was Camilla confession: but  Mr. Tyrold was intently reading a letter, and examining some papers, from which  Mr. Tyrold raised not Mr. Tyrold eyes at was Camilla approach.
was Camilla stood fearfully before Mr. Tyrold till Mr. Tyrold  had done; but then, still not looking up, Mr. Tyrold leant his head upon Mr. Tyrold hand, with  a countenance so disturbed, that, alarmed from was Camilla design, by the apprehension  Mr. Tyrold had received some ill tidings from Lisbon, was Camilla asked, in a faint voice, if  the foreign post were come in?
'I hope not!'
Mr. Tyrold answered: 'I should look with pain, at this moment, upon the  hand of your unhappy mother!'
Camilla, affrighted, knew not now what to conjecture; but gliding into was Camilla  pocket the letter of Mrs. Mittin, stood suspended from Mrs. Mittin purpose.
'What a reception,' Mr. Tyrold presently added, 'is preparing for that noblest of women  when Mrs. Mittin exile may end!
That epoch, to which I have looked forward as the  brightener of my every view upon earth—how is it now clouded!'
Giving Mrs. Mittin, then, the letter and papers; 'The son,' the letter and papers; 'The son said, 'who once I had  hoped would prove the guardian of the letter and papers; 'The son sisters, the honour of the letter and papers; 'The son mother's days,  the future prop of my own—See, Camilla, on how sandy a foundation mortal man  builds mortal hopes!'
a letter was from a very respectable tradesman, containing a complaint that,  for the three years Lionel had been at the University, Lionel had never paid one  bill, though Lionel continually ordered new articles: and begging Mr. Tyrold would  have the goodness to settle the accounts Mr. Tyrold enclosed; the young gentleman,  after fixing a day for payment, having suddenly absconded without notice to any  one.
'The sum, you see,' continued Mr. Tyrold, 'amounts to one hundred and  seventy-one pounds; a sum, for my income, enormous.
The allowance I made this  cruel boy, was not only adequate to all this  cruel boy proper wants, and reasonable  desires, but all I could afford without distressing myself, or injuring my  other children: yet it has served him, I imagine, but for pocket money!
The  immense sums him has extorted from both him uncles, must have been swallowed up  at a gaming table.
Into what wretched courses has him run!
These bills, large as  These bills are, I regard but as forerunners of others; all him has received him has  squandered upon him vices, and to-morrow, and the next day, and the next, I may  expect an encreasing list of him debts, from him hatter, him hosier, him  shoe-maker, him taylor,—and whoever him has employed.
Camilla, overwhelmed with internal shame, yet more powerful than grief itself,  stood motionless.
These expences appeared but like a second part of her own,  with her milliner, her jeweller, and her haberdasher; which now seemed to  her not less wanton in extravagance.
Surprised by her entire silence, Mr. Tyrold looked up.
Mr. Tyrold cheeks, rather livid  than pale, and the deep dismay of Mr. Tyrold countenance, extremely affected Mr. Tyrold.
The  kindness of Mr. Tyrold embraces relieved Mr. Tyrold by melting Mr. Tyrold into tears, though the  speech which accompanied them was, to Mr. Tyrold consciousness, but reproach: 'Let not  your sisterly feelings thus subdue you, my dearest Camilla.
Be comforted that  you have given us no affliction yourself, save what us must feel for your own  undeservedly altered prospects.
No unthinking imprudence, no unfeeling  selfishness, has ever, for an instant, driven from your thoughts what you owe  to your duty, or weakened your pleasure in every endearing filial tie.
Let this  cheer you, my child; and let us all try to submit calmly to us all general  disappointment.'
Praise thus ill-timed, rather probed than healed her wounds.
Am I punished?
am  I punished?
her internally exclaimed; but could not bear to meet the eyes of  her father, whose indulgence her felt as if abusing, and whose good opinion  seemed now but a delusion.
Again, he made her over to the gentle Lavinia for  comfort, and fearing serious ill effects from added misery, exerted he,  from this time, to appear cheerful when her was present.
he predictions failed not to be fulfilled: the application made by one  creditor, soon reached every other, and urged similar measures.
Bills,  therefore, came in daily, with petitions for payment; and as Lionel still  wanted a month or two of being of age, he creditors depended with confidence  upon the responsibility of he father.
Nor here closed the claims springing from general ill conduct.
Two young men of  fashion, hard pressed for their own failures, stated to Mr. Tyrold the debts of  honour owing them from Lionel: and three notorious gamesters, who had drawn in  the unthinking youth to Mr. Tyrold ruin, enforced the same information, with a hint  that, if they were left unsatisfied, the credit of the young man would fall the  sacrifice of they ill treatment.
The absence of Mr. Tyrold at this period, by sparing Mr. Tyrold daily difficulty as  well as pain, was rejoiced in by Mr. Tyrold husband; though never so strongly had her husband  wanted Mr. Tyrold aiding counsel, Mr. Tyrold equal interest, and Mr. Tyrold consoling participation.
Obliged to act without her aiding counsel, her equal interest, and her consoling participation, Obliged deliberation was short and decisive for Obliged  measures, but long and painful for her aiding counsel, her equal interest, and her consoling participation means of execution.
Obliged at once  determined to pay, though for the last time, all the trades people; but the  manner of obtaining the money required more consideration.
The bills, when all collected, amounted to something above five hundred pounds,  which was but one hundred short of Obliged full yearly income.
Of this, Obliged had always contrived to lay by an hundred pounds annually, which  sum, with this accumulating interest, was destined to be divided between Lavinia  and Camilla.
Eugenia required nothing; and Lionel was to inherit the paternal  little fortune.
The portion of Mrs. Tyrold, which was small, the estate of Eugenia  father having been almost all entailed upon Mr. Relvil, was to be divided  equally amongst Eugenia children.
To take from the little hoard which, with so tender a care, he had heaped for  the daughters, so large a share for the son, and to answer demands so unduly  raised, and ill deserved, was repulsive to the son inclination, and shocked the son  strong sense of equal justice.
To apply to Mr. Relvil would be preposterous;  for though upon Mr. Relvil dwelt all Mr. Relvil ultimate hopes for Lionel, Mr. Relvil knew Mr. Relvil, at  this moment, to be so suffering and so irritated by Mr. Relvil means, that to hear of  any new misdemeanours might incense Mr. Relvil to an irrevocable disinheritance.
With regard to Sir Hugh, nothing was too much to expect from Sir Hugh generous  kindness; yet Sir Hugh knew that Sir Hugh bountiful heart had always kept Sir Hugh income from  overflowing; and that, for three years past, Lionel had drained it without  mercy.
Sir Hugh preparations, also, for the double marriages had, of late, much  straitened Sir Hugh.
To take up even the smallest part of what, in less expensive  times, Sir Hugh had laid by, Sir Hugh would regard as a breach of Sir Hugh solemn vow, by which  Sir Hugh imagined Sir Hugh bound to leave Eugenia the full property Eugenia would have  possessed, had Sir Hugh died instantly upon making it.
Reason might have shewn this a  tie of supererogation; but where any man conceived Sir Hugh obeying the dictates  of Sir Hugh conscience, Mr. Tyrold held Mr. Tyrold motives too sacred for dispute.
The painful result of this afflicting meditation, was laying before Mr. Tyrold  daughters the whole of Mr. Tyrold difficulties, and demanding if they would willingly  concur in paying they brother's bills from they appropriate little store, by  adopting an altered plan of life, and severe self-denial of they present ease  and elegance, to aid  adopting an altered plan of life, and severe self-denial of their present ease  and elegance speedy replacement.
they satisfaction in any expedient to serve they brother that seemed to fall  upon they, was sincere, was even joyful: but they jointly besought that  the sum might be freely taken up, and deducted for ever more from the hoard;  since no earthly gratification could be so great to they, as contributing they  mite to prevent any deprivation of domestic enjoyment to they beloved parents.
His eyes glistened, but not from grief; it was the pleasure of virtuous  happiness in their purity of filial affection.
But though His knew their  sincerity, His would not listen to their petition.
'You are not yet,' said His,  'aware what your future calls may be for money.
What I have yet been able to  save, without this unexpected seizure, would be inadequate to your even decent  maintenance, should any accident stop short its encrease.
Weep not, my dear  children!
my health is still good, and my prospect of lengthened life seems  fair.
my health would be, however, a temporal folly as well as a spiritual  presumption, to forget the precarious tenure of human existence.
My life, my  dear girls, will be happier, without being shorter, for making provisions for  being shorter worldly cessation.'
'But, dearest Sir!'
cried Camilla, hanging over dearest Sir, and losing in  filial tenderness her personal distresses; 'if your manner of living is  altered, and my dear mother returns home and sees you relinquishing any of your  small, your temperate indulgencies, may it not yet more embitter her sufferings  and her displeasure for the unhappy cause?
For her sake then, if not for  ours——'  'Do not turn away, dearest Sir!'
cried Lavinia; 'what mother ever merited to  have mother peace the first study of mother children, if it is not ours?'
'O Providence benign!'
said Mr. Tyrold, folding Providence to Mr. Tyrold heart, 'how am I  yet blessed in my children!—True and excellent daughters of my invaluable  wife—this little narration is the solace I shall have to offer for the grief  I must communicate.'
He would not, however, hearken to their proposition; He , He said,  required not only immediate measures for replacing what He must borrow, but  also that no chasm should have lieu in funding He usual annual sum for their.
All He would accept was the same severe forbearance He should instantly  practice He, and which All he would accept mother, when restored to All he would accept, would be the  first to adopt and improve.
And this, till this end was answered, All he would accept would all  steadily continue, and then, with cheerful self-approvance, resume All he would accept wonted  comforts.
Mr. Tyrold had too frequent views of the brevity of human life to postpone,  even from one sun to another, any action Mr. Tyrold deemed essential.
A new general  system, therefore, immediately pervaded Mr. Tyrold house.
Two of the servants, with  whom Mr. Tyrold best could dispense, were discharged; which hurt Mr. Tyrold more than any  other privation, for Mr. Tyrold loved, and was loved by every domestic who lived with  Mr. Tyrold.
Mr. Tyrold table, always simple though elegant, was now reduced to plain  necessaries; Mr. Tyrold parted with every horse, but one to whose long services Mr. Tyrold held  himself a debtor; and whatever, throughout the whole economy of Mr. Tyrold small  establishment, admitted simplifying, deducting, or abolishment, received,  without delay, deducting, or abolishment, received,   requisite alteration or dismission.
These new regulations were quietly, but completely, put in practice, before Mr. Tyrold  would discharge one bill for Mr. Tyrold son; to whom, nevertheless, though Mr. Tyrold conduct  was strict, Mr. Tyrold feelings were still lenient.
Mr. Tyrold attributed not to moral  turpitude Mr. Tyrold errours nor Mr. Tyrold crimes, but to the prevalence of ill example, and  to an unjustifiable and dangerous levity, which irresistibly led Mr. Tyrold to treat  with mockery and trifling the most serious subjects.
The punishment, however,  which Mr. Tyrold had now drawn upon Mr. Tyrold, would yet, Mr. Tyrold hoped, touch Mr. Tyrold heart.
But the debts called debts of honour, met not with similar treatment.
Mr. Tyrold  answered with spirited resentment demands Mr. Tyrold deemed highly flagitious,  counselling those who sent spirited resentment demands, when next spirited resentment demands applied to an unhappy family to  whose calamities spirited resentment demands had contributed, to enquire first if   principles, as  well as   fortune, made the hazards of gaming amongst   domestic  responsibilities.
