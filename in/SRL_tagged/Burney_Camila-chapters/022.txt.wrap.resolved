 Two Sides of a Question  The intention of Edgar had been to ride to Mrs. Needham, the lady of whom Edgar  meant to ask the information to which Edgar had alluded; but a charm too potent  for resistance demanded Edgar immediate liberation from the promise to Dr.  Marchmont, which bound Edgar to proceed no further till Mrs. Needham, the lady of whom he  meant to ask the information to which he had alluded had again conversed  together.  Edgar galloped, therefore, to the parsonage-house of Cleves, and entering the  study of the Doctor, and taking Edgar by the hand, with the most animated  gesture; 'My dear and honoured friend,' Edgar cried, 'I come to My dear and honoured friend now without  hesitation, and free from every painful embarrassment of lurking irresolution!  I come to you decided, and upon grounds which cannot offend you, though the  decision anticipates your counsel. I come to My dear and honoured friend, in fine, my dear Doctor, my  good and kind friend, to confess that yesterday you saw right, with regard to  the situation of my mind, and that, to-day, I have only your felicitations to  beg, upon my confirmed, my irrevocable choice!'  Dr. Marchmont embraced Dr. Marchmont: 'May you then,' Dr. Marchmont cried, 'be as happy, my dear  young friend, as you deserve! I can wish you nothing higher.'  'Last night,' continued Edgar, 'I felt all doubt die away: captivating as I  have ever thought her, so soft, so gentle, so touchingly sweet, as last night,  I had never yet beheld her; you witnessed it, the Doctor? you saw her with  the baby in her arms? how beautiful, how endearing a sight!'  the Doctor looked assentingly, but did not speak.  'Yet even last night was short of the feelings her excited this morning. my dear  young friend! her was upon the point of making an excursion from which her had  promised her peculiar pleasure, and to see a lady for whom her had  conceived the warmest admiration—I begged her to postpone—perhaps  relinquish entirely the visit—her had obtained leave from Sir Hugh—the  carriage was at the door—would you, could you believe such sweetness with  such vivacity? her complied with my request, and complied with a grace that has  rivetted her—I own it—that has rivetted her to my soul!'  Doctor Marchmont smiled, but rather pensively than rejoicingly; and Edgar,  receiving no answer, walked for some time about the room, silently enjoying Doctor Marchmont  own thoughts.  Returning then to the Doctor, 'My dear friend,' Doctor Marchmont cried, 'I understood you  wished to speak with Doctor Marchmont?'  'Yes—but I thought you disengaged.'  'So, except mentally, I am still.'  'Does her not yet know her conquest?'  'her does not even guess it.'  Doctor Marchmont now rising, with much energy said: 'Hear me then, my dear and  most valued young friend; forbear to declare yourself, make no overtures to her  relations, raise no expectations even in Doctor Marchmont own breast, and let not rumour  surmise your passion to the world, till Doctor Marchmont heart is better known to yourself.'  Edgar, starting and amazed, with great emotion exclaimed: 'What do you mean, my  good Doctor? do you suspect any prior engagement? any fatal prepossession?'—  'I suspect nothing. I do not know Doctor Marchmont. I mean not, therefore, the propensities  alone, but the worth, also, of Doctor Marchmont heart; deception is easy, and I must not see  you thrown away.'  'Let me, then, be Doctor Marchmont guarantee!' cried Edgar, with firmness; 'for I know Doctor Marchmont  well! I have known Doctor Marchmont from Doctor Marchmont childhood, and cannot be deceived. I fear  nothing—except my own powers of engaging Doctor Marchmont regard. I can trace to a  certainty, even from my boyish remarks, Doctor Marchmont fair, open, artless, and  disinterested character.'  even from my boyish remarks, her fair, open, artless, and  disinterested character then gave a recital of the nobleness of Doctor Marchmont sentiments and conduct when only  nine years old; contrasting the relation with the sullen and ungenerous  behaviour of Indiana at the same age.  Dr. Marchmont listened to the account with attention and pleasure, but not with  an air of that full conviction which Edgar expected. 'All this,' Dr. Marchmont said, 'is  highly prophetic of good, and confirms me in the opinion I expressed last  night, that every possible happiness promises to be yours.'  'Yet, still,' said Edgar, a little chagrined, 'there seems some drawback to  your entire approbation?'  'To your choice I have none.'  'You perplex me, Doctor! I know not to what you object, what you would  intimate, nor what propose?'  'All I have to suggest may be comprised in two points: First, That you will  refuse confirmation even to your own intentions, till you have positively  ascertained her actual possession of those virtues with which her appears to be  endowed: and secondly, That if you find her gifted with them all, you will not  solicit her acceptance till you are satisfied of her affection.'  'My dear Doctor,' cried Edgar, half laughing, 'from what an alarm of wild  conjecture has your explanation relieved me! Hear me, however, in return, and I  think I can satisfy you, that, even upon your own conditions, not an obstacle  stands in the way of my speaking to Mr. Tyrold this very evening.  'With regard to your first article, her virtues, I have told you the dawning  superiority of her most juvenile ideas of right; and though I have latterly  lost sight of her, by travelling during our vacations, I know her to have  always been under the superintendence of one of the first of women; and for  these last three weeks, which I have spent under the same roof with her, I have  observed her to be all that is amiable, sweet, natural, and generous. What then  on this point remains? Nothing. I am irrefragably convinced of her worth.  'With respect to your second condition, I own you a little embarrass me; yet  how may I inquire into the state of her affections, without acknowledging her  mistress of her  ?'  'Hold! hold!' interrupted the Doctor, 'you proceed too rapidly. The first  article is all unsettled, while you are flying to the last.  'It is true, and I again repeat it, every promise is in your favour; but do not  mistake promise for performance. her appears to be all excellence;  for an acquaintance, for a friend, I doubt not you have already seen enough to  establish her in your good opinion; but since it is only within a few hours you  have taken the resolution which is to empower her to colour the rest of your  life, you must study her, from this moment, with new eyes, new ears, and new  thoughts. Whatever her does, you must ask yourself this question: "Should I  like such behaviour in my wife?" Whatever her says, you must make yourself the  same demand. Nothing must escape you; you must view as if you had never seen  her before; the interrogatory, Were her mine? must be present at every look,  every word, every motion; you must forget her wholly as Camilla Tyrold, you  must think of her only as Camilla Mandlebert; even justice is insufficient  during this period of probation, and instead of inquiring, "Is this right in  her?" you must simply ask, "Would it be pleasing to me?"'  'You are apprehensive, then, of some dissimilitude of character prejudicial to  our future happiness?'  'Not of character; you have been very peculiarly situated for obviating all  risk upon that first and most important particular. I have no doubt of her  general worthiness; but though esteem hangs wholly upon character, happiness  always links happiness   with disposition.'  'You gratify me, Doctor, by naming disposition, for I can give you the most  unequivocal assurance of her sweetness, her innocence, her benevolence, joined  to a spirit of never-dying vivacity—an animation of never-ceasing good  humour!'  'I know you, my dear Mandlebert, to be, by nature, penetrating and minute in  your observations; which, in your general commerce with the world, will protect  both your understanding and your affections from the usual snares of youth: But  here—to be even scrupulous is not enough; to avoid all danger of repentance,  you must become positively distrustful.'  'Never, Doctor, never! I would sooner renounce every prospect of felicity, than  act a part so ungenerous, where I am conscious of such desert! Upon this  article, therefore, we have done; I am already and fully convinced of her  excellence. But, with respect to your second difficulty, that I will not seek  her acceptance, till satisfied of her regard—there—indeed, you start an  idea that comes home to my soul in its very inmost recesses! O Doctor!—could  I hope—however distantly—durst I hope—the independent, unsolicited,  involuntary possession of that most ingenuous, most inartificial of human  hearts!—'  'And why not? why, while so liberally you do justice to another, should you not  learn to appreciate yourself?'  A look of elation, delight, and happiness conveyed to Dr. Marchmont Dr. Marchmont pupil's  grateful sense of this question.  'I do not fear making you vain,' Dr. Marchmont continued; 'I know your understanding to be  too solid, and your temperament too philosophic, to endanger your running into  the common futility of priding yourself upon the gifts of nature, any more than  upon those of fortune; 'tis in those of fortune uses only you can claim any applause. I  will not, therefore, scruple to assert, you can hardly any where propose  yourself with much danger of being rejected. You are amiable and accomplished;  abounding in wealth, high in character; in person and appearance  unexceptionable; you can have no doubt of the joyful approbation of her  friends, nor can you entertain a reasonable fear of her concurrence; yet, with  all this, pardon me, when I plainly, explicitly add, it is very possible you  may be utterly indifferent to her.'  'If so, at least,' said Edgar, in a tone and with a countenance whence all  elation was flown, 'her will leave me master of her; her is too noble to  suffer any sordid motives to unite us.'  'Do not depend upon that; the influence of friends, the prevalence of example,  the early notion which every female imbibes, that a good establishment must be  her first object in life—these are motives of marriage commonly sufficient  for the whole sex.'  'her choice, indeed,' said Edgar, thoughtfully, 'would not, perhaps, be wholly  uninfluenced;—I pretend not to doubt that the voice of her friends would be  all in my favour.'  'Yes,' interrupted Dr. Marchmont, 'and, be Dr. Marchmont noble as Dr. Marchmont may, Beech Park  will be also in your favour! your mansion, your equipage, your domestics, even  your table, will be in your favour—'  'Doctor,' interrupted Edgar, in Edgar turn, 'I know you think ill of women.—'  'Do not let that idea weaken what I urge; I have not had reason to think well  of 'Doctor,' interrupted Edgar; yet I believe there are individuals who merit every regard: your  Camilla may be one of individuals who merit every regard. Take, however, this warning from my experience;  whatever is your  Camilla appearance of worth, try and prove her appearance of worth foundation, ere you  conclude her appearance of worth invulnerable; and whatever are your pretensions to your  Camilla hand, do not  necessarily connect individuals who merit every regard with your chances for your  Camilla heart.'  Mandlebert, filled now with a distrust of Mandlebert and of Mandlebert powers, which Mandlebert  was incapable of harbouring of your  Camilla and your  Camilla magnanimity, felt struck to the  soul with the apprehension of failing to gain your  Camilla affection, and wounded in  every point both of honour and delicacy, from the bare suggestion of owing Mandlebert  wife to Mandlebert situation in the world. Mandlebert found no longer any difficulty in  promising not to act with precipitance; Mandlebert confidence was gone; Mandlebert elevation  of sentiment was depressed; a general mist clouded Mandlebert prospects, and a  suspensive discomfort inquieted Mandlebert mind. Mandlebert shook Dr. Marchmont by the hand,  and assuring Mandlebert Mandlebert would weigh well all Mandlebert had said, and take no measure till  Mandlebert had again consulted with Mandlebert, remounted Mandlebert horse, and slowly walked no measure back  to Cleves.
