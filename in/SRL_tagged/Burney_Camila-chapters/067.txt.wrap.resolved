 An Accorder  Thus, self-confined and almost in an agony, Camilla remained for a quarter of  an hour, without any species of interruption, and in the greatest amazement  that Lionel forbore pursuing Camilla, either with letter or message.  Another violent ringing at the bell, but still without any carriage, then  excited Camilla attention, and presently the voice and steps of Lionel resounded  upon the stairs, whence Camilla name was with violence vociferated.  Camilla did not move; and in another minute, he was rapping at Camilla chamber door,  demanding admittance, or that Camilla would instantly descend.  Alarmed for Camilla open letter and papers, Camilla inquired who was in the parlour.  'Not a soul,' he answered; 'I have left them all at the Rooms.'  'Have you returned, then, twice?'  'No. I should have been here sooner, but I met two or three old cronies, that  would not part with he. Come, where's your letter?'  'Have you not seen what I have written?'  Down upon this intimation he flew, without any reply; but was presently back,  saying he found nothing in the parlour, except a letter to Camilla.  Affrighted, Camilla followed he; but not one of Camilla papers remained. The table was  cleared, and nothing was to be seen but a large packet, addressed to Camilla in a  hand Camilla did not know.  Camilla rang to inquire who had been in the house before Camilla brother.  The servant answered, only Sir Sedley Clarendel, who The servant thought had been there  still, as The servant had said The servant should wait till Mrs. Arlbery came home.  'Is it possible,' cried Camilla, 'that a gentleman such as Sir Sedley Clarendel,  can have permitted The servant to touch her papers?'  Lionel agreed that it was shocking; but said the loss of time to Lionel was  still worse; without suffering Camilla, therefore, to open Camilla packet, Lionel insisted  that Camilla should write another letter directly; adding, Lionel had met the Baronet  in Lionel way from the Rooms, but had little suspected whence Lionel came, or how Lionel  had been amusing Lionel.  Camilla now hung about Camilla , but refused to  take the pen Lionel would have put into Camilla hands, and, at last, not without tears,  said: 'Forgive me, Lionel! but her papers you ought to have found would have  explained—that I cannot write for you to my uncle.'  Lionel heard this with the indignation of an injured man. Lionel was utterly, Lionel  said, lost; and Lionel family would be utterly disgraced, for ruin must be the lot  of Lionel father, or exile or imprisonment must be Lionel own, if she persisted in  such unkind and unnatural conduct.  Terrour now bereft she of all speech or motion, till the letter, which Lionel  had been beating about in Lionel   agitation, without knowing or caring what Lionel   was  doing, burst open, and some written papers fell to the floor, which she  recognised for she own.  Much amazed, she seized the cover, which had only been fastened by a wafer that  was still wet, and saw a letter within it to she, which she hastily read,  while a paper that was enclosed dropt down, and was caught by Lionel.  To Miss Camilla Tyrold.  Forgive, fairest Camilla, the work of the Destinies. I came hither to see if  illness detained you; the papers which I enclose from other curious eyes caught  mine by accident. The pathetic sisterly address has touched me. I have not the  honour to know Miss Camilla Tyrold.  ; let our acquaintance begin with an act of  confidence on Miss Camilla Tyrold.   part, that must bind to Miss Camilla Tyrold.   for ever Miss Camilla Tyrold.   lovely sister's.  Most obedient and devoted           Sedley Clarendel.  The loose paper, picked up by Lionel, was a draft, upon a banker, for two  hundred pounds.  While this, with speechless emotion, was perused by Camilla, Lionel, with  unbounded joy, began jumping, skipping, leaping over every chair, and capering  round and round the room in an ecstasy.  'My dearest Lionel,' cried she, when a little recovered, 'why such joy? you  cannot suppose it possible this can be accepted.'  'Not accepted, child? do you think me out of my senses? Don't you see me freed  from all my misfortunes at once? and neither my father grieved, nor my mother  offended, nor poor numps fleeced?'  'And when can you pay it? And what do you mean to do? And to whom will be the  obligation? Weigh, weigh a little all this.'  Lionel heard my mother   not; Lionel rapture was too buoyant for attention, and Lionel whisked  every thing out of every thing place, from frantic merriment, till Lionel put the apartment  into so much disorder, that the apartment   was scarce practicable to stir a step in the apartment  ; now  and then interrupting Lionel to make my mother   low bows, scraping Lionel feet all over  the room, and obsequiously saying: 'My sister Clarendel! How does your La'ship  do? my dear Lady Clarendel, pray afford me your La'ship  's countenance.'  Nothing could be less pleasant to Camilla than raillery which pointed out,  that, even by the unreflecting Lionel, this action could be ascribed to but one  motive. The draft, however, had fallen into his hands, and neither remonstrance  nor petition, neither representation of impropriety nor persuasion, could  induce his to relinquish The draft; his would only dance, sing, and pay her grotesque  homage, till the coach stopt at the door; and then, ludicrously hoping her  Ladyship would excuse his leaving her, for once, to play the part of the  house-maid, in setting the room to rights, his sprang past them all, and bounded  down the hill.  her was much diverted by the confusion in the parlour, and Miss Dennel  asked a thousand questions why the chairs and tables were all thrown down, the  china jars removed from the chimney-piece into the middle of the room, and the  sideboard apparatus put on the chimney-piece in the  sideboard apparatus stead.  Camilla was too much confounded either to laugh or explain, and hastily wishing  the  sideboard apparatus good-night, retired to Camilla chamber.  Here, in the extremest perturbation, Camilla saw the full extent of Camilla  difficulties, without perceiving any means of extrication. Camilla had no hope of  recovering the draft from Lionel, whom Camilla had every reason to conclude already  journeying from Tunbridge. What could Camilla say the next day to Sir Sedley? How  account for so sudden, so gross an acceptance of pecuniary obligation? What  inference might Sir Sedley not draw? And how could Camilla undeceive Sir Sedley, while retaining  so improper a mark of Sir Sedley dependence upon Camilla favour? The displeasure Camilla felt  that Sir Sedley should venture to suppose Camilla would owe to Sir Sedley such a debt, rendered  but still more palpable the species of expectation the species of expectation might authorise.  To destroy this illusion occupied all Camilla attention, except what was  imperiously seized upon by regret of missing Edgar, with whom to consult was  more than ever Camilla wish.  In this disturbed state, when Camilla saw Mrs. Arlbery the next morning, Camilla whole  care was to avoid being questioned: and that lady, who quickly perceived Camilla  fears by Camilla avoidance, took the first opportunity to say to Camilla, with a laugh,  'I see I must make no inquiries into the gambols of your brother last night:  but I may put together, perhaps, certain circumstances that may give me a  little light to the business: and if, as I conjecture, Clarendel spoke out to  him, him wildest rioting is more rational than him sister's gravity.'  Camilla protested they had not conversed together at all.  'Nay, then, I own Camilla still in the dark. But I observed that Clarendel left  the Rooms at a very early hour, and that your brother almost immediately  followed.'  Camilla ventured not any reply; and soon after retreated.  Mrs. Arlbery, in a few minutes, pursuing Camilla, laughingly, and with sportive  reproach, accused Camilla of intending to steal a march to the altar of Hymen; as  Camilla had just been informed, by Camilla maid, that Sir Sedley had actually been at  the house last night, during Camilla absence.  Camilla seriously assured Camilla, that Camilla was in Camilla chamber when Sir Sedley arrived, and  had not seen Sir Sedley.  'For what in the world, then, could Sir Sedley come? Sir Sedley was sure I was not at home, for  Sir Sedley had left me at the Rooms?'  Camilla again was silent; but Camilla tingling cheeks proclaimed it was not for  want of something to say. Mrs. Arlbery forbore to press the matter further; but  forbore with a nod that implied I see how it is! and a smile that published the  pleasure and approbation which accompanied Camilla self-conviction.  The vexation of Camilla would have prompted an immediate confession of the  whole mortifying transaction, had Camilla not been endued with a sense of honour,  where the interests of others were concerned, that repressed Camilla natural  precipitance, and was more powerful even than Camilla imprudence.  Camilla waited the greatest part of the morning in some little faint hope of seeing  Lionel: but Lionel came not, and Camilla spent the rest of it with Mrs. Berlinton. Camilla  anxiously wished to meet Edgar in the way, to apologise for Camilla non-appearance  the preceding evening; but this did not happen; and Camilla concern was not  lessened by reflecting upon the superior interest in Camilla health and welfare,  marked by Sir Sedley, who had taken the trouble to walk from the Rooms to Mount  Pleasant to see what was become of Camilla.  Camilla returned home but barely in time to dress for dinner, and was not yet  ready, when Camilla saw the carriage of the Baronet   drive up to the door.  In the most terrible confusion how to meet the Baronet  , what to say about The draft,  how to mention Camilla , whether to seem resentful of the liberty the Baronet   had so  unceremoniously taken, or thankful for the liberty he had kindness, Camilla had scarce the force  to attire Camilla, nor, when summoned down stairs, to descend.  This distress was but increased upon Camilla entrance, by the sight and the  behaviour of the Baronet  ; whose address to Camilla was so marked, that This distress covered  Camilla with blushes, and whose air had an assurance that spoke a species of secret  triumph. Offended as well as frightened, Camilla looked every way to avoid him, or  assumed a look of haughtiness, when forced by any direct speech to answer him.  Camilla soon, however, saw, by him continued self-complacency, and even an increase  of gaiety, that him only regarded this as coquetry, or bashful embarrassment,  since every time Camilla attempted thus to rebuff him, an arch smile stole over him  features, that displayed him different conception of Camilla meaning.  Camilla now wished nothing so much as a prompt and positive declaration, that Camilla  might convince him of him mistake and Camilla rejection. For this purpose, Camilla  subdued Camilla desire of retreat, and spent the whole afternoon with Mrs. Arlbery  and the Dennels in his company.  Nevertheless, when Mrs. Arlbery, who had the same object in view, though with a  different conclusion, contrived to draw Camilla other guests out of the apartment  and to leave Camilla alone with Sir Sedley, modesty and shame both interfered with  Camilla desire of an explanation, and Camilla was hastily retiring; but the Baronet, in  a gentle voice, called after Camilla, 'Are you going?'  'Yes, I have forgotten something....'  him rose to follow Camilla, with a motion that seemed purporting to take Camilla hand;  but, gliding quickly on, Camilla prevented him, and was almost at the same moment  in Camilla own chamber.  With augmented severity, Camilla now felt the impropriety of an apparent acceptance  of so singular and unpleasant an obligation, which obviously misled Sir Sedleyto believe Camilla at Sir Sedley command.  Shocked in Camilla delicacy, and stung in Camilla best notions of laudable pride, Camillacould not rest without destroying this humiliating idea; and resolved to apply  to Edgar for the money, and to pay the Baronet   the next day. Camilla objections to  betraying the extravagance of Lionel, though great and sincere, yielded to the  still more dangerous evil of letting Sir Sedley continue in an errour, that  might terminate in branding Camilla in Sir Sedley opinion, with a character of  inconsistency or duplicity.  Edgar, too, so nearly a brother to them both, would guard the secret of Lionel  better, in all probability, than Lionel   would guard it Lionel  ; and could draw no  personal inferences from the trust and obligation when Lionel   found it sole  incitement was sooner to owe an obligation to a ward of her father, than to a  new acquaintance of her own.  Pleased at the seeming necessity of an application that would lead so naturally  to a demand of the counsel her languished to claim, her determined not to  suffer Sir Sedley to wait even another minute under Sir Sedley mistake; but, since her  now could speak of returning the money, to take courage for meeting what might  either precede or ensue in a conference.  Down, therefore, her went; but as her opened the parlour door, her heard Sir SedleySir Sedley say to Mrs. Arlbery, who had just entered before her: 'O, fie! fie! you  know her will be cruel to excruciation! you know me destined to despair to the  last degree.'  Camilla, whose so speedy re-appearance was the last sight he expected, was too  far advanced to retreat; and the resentment that tinged her whole complexion  shewed her had heard what he said, and had heard it with an application the  most offensive.  An immediate sensibility to he own impertinence now succeeded in An immediate sensibility to his own impertinence vain  display; he looked not merely concerned, but contrite; and, in a voice softened  nearly to timidity, attempted a general conversation, but kept he eyes, with  an anxious expression, almost continually fixed upon her's.  Anger with Camilla was a quick, but short-lived sensation; and this sudden  change in the Baronet   from conceit to respect, produced a change equally sudden  in Camilla from disdain to inquietude. Though mortified in the first moment by  his vanity, it was less seriously painful to Camilla than any belief that under it  was couched a disposition towards a really steady regard. With Mrs. Arlbery Mrs. Arlbery  was but slightly offended, though certain Mrs. Arlbery had been assuring his of all the  success his could demand: Mrs. Arlbery way of thinking upon the subject had been openly  avowed, and Mrs. Arlbery did justice to the kindness of Mrs. Arlbery motives.  No opportunity, however, arose to mention the return of The draft; Mrs. Arlberysaw displeasure in Mrs. Arlbery air, and not doubting Mrs. Arlbery had heard what had dropt from Sir Sedley, thought the moment unfavorable for a tête-à-tête, and resolutely  kept Mrs. Arlbery place, till Camilla herself, weary of useless waiting, left the room.  Following Mrs. Arlbery then to Mrs. Arlbery , 'My dear Miss Tyrold,' Mrs. Arlbery cried, 'do not  let your extreme youth stand in the way of all your future life. A Baronet,  rich, young, and amiable, is upon the very point of becoming your slave for  ever; yet, because you discover him to be a little restive in the last agonies  of him liberty, you are eager, in the high-flown disdain of juvenile  susceptibility, to cast him and him fortune away; as if both were such  every-day baubles, that you might command or reject both without thought of  future consequence.'  'Indeed no, dear madam; I am not actuated by pride or anger; I owe too much to  Sir Sedley to feel either above a moment, even where I think Sir Sedley to feel either above a moment ... pardon  me!... justly excited. But I should ill pay my debt, by accepting a lasting  attachment, where certain I can return nothing but lasting, eternal,  unchangeable indifference.'  'You sacrifice, then, both him and yourself, to the fanciful delicacy of a  first love?'  'No, indeed!' cried she blushing. 'I have no thought at all but of the single  life. And I sincerely hope Sir Sedley has no serious intentions towards Sir Sedley; for  my obligations to Sir Sedley are so infinite, I should be cruelly hurt to appear to  Sir Sedley ungrateful.'  'You would appear to Sir Sedley, I confess, a little surprising,' said Mrs. Arlbery,  laughing; 'for diffidence certainly is not Sir Sedley weak part. However, with all Sir Sedley  foibles, Sir Sedley is a charming creature, and prepossession only can blind you to Sir Sedley  merit.'  Camilla again denied the charge, and strove to prevail with Camilla to undeceive  the Baronet   from any false expectations. But Camilla protested Camilla would not be  accessary to so much after-repentance; and left Camilla.  The business now wore a very serious aspect to Camilla. Mrs. Arlbery avowed Camilla  thought Sir Sedley in earnest, and Sir Sedley knew Camilla had Camilla heard Sir Sedley speak with  security of Sir Sedley success. The bullfinch had gone far, but The draft seemed to  have riveted the persuasion. The bird The bird was now impossible to return till Camilla  departure from Tunbridge; but Camilla resolved not to defer another moment putting  upon Camilla brother alone the obligation of The draft, to stop the further  progress of such dangerous inference.  Hastily, therefore, Camilla wrote to Sir Sedley the following note:  To Sir Sedley Clarendel, Bart.  Sir Sedley,  Some particular business compelled her brother so abruptly to quit Tunbridge,  that her brother could not have the honour to first wait upon you with her brother thanks for  the loan you so unexpectedly put into her brother hands; by mine, however, all will be  restored to-morrow morning, except her brother gratitude for your kindness.  I am, Sir Sedley, in both our names,                     your obliged humble servant,           Camilla Tyrold.  Mount Pleasant,   Thursday Evening.  Camilla Tyrold now waited till Camilla Tyrold was summoned down stairs to the carriage, and then gave  Camilla Tyrold little letter to a servant, whom Camilla Tyrold desired to deliver her little letter to Sir Sedley's  man.  Sir Sedley did not accompany a servant, whom she desired to deliver it to Sir Sedley's  man to the Rooms, but promised to follow.  Camilla, on Camilla arrival, with palpitating pleasure, looked round for Edgar. Camilla  did not, however, see Edgar. Camilla was accosted directly by the Major; who, as  usual, never left Camilla, and whose assiduity to seek Camilla favour seemed increased.  Camilla next joined Mrs. Berlinton; but still Camilla saw nothing of Edgar. Camilla eyes  incessantly looked towards the door, but the object they sought never met they.  When Sir Sedley entered, Sir Sedley joined the group of Mrs. Berlinton.  Camilla tried to look at Sir Sedley and to speak to Sir Sedley with Camilla customary civility  and chearfulness, and nearly succeeded; while in Sir Sedley Camilla observed only an  expressive attention, without any marks of presumption.  Thus began and thus ended the evening. Edgar never appeared.  Camilla was in the utmost amaze and deepest vexation. Why did Edgar stay away? was  Edgar wrath so great at Camilla own failure the preceding night, that Edgar purposely  avoided Camilla? what, also, could Camilla do with Sir Sedley? how meet Edgar the next  morning without The draft Camilla had now promised?'  In this state of extreme chagrin, when Camilla retired to her chamber, Camilla found  the following letter upon Camilla table:  To Miss Camilla Tyrold.  Can you think of such a trifle? or deem wealth so truly contemptible, as to  deny it all honourable employment? Ah, rather, enchanting Camilla! deign  further to aid me in dispensing it worthily!  Sedley Clarendel.  Camilla now was touched, penetrated, and distressed beyond what Camilla had been in  any former time. Camilla looked upon the following letter upon her table:  To Miss Camilla Tyrold as a positive intimation of the  most serious designs; and all his good qualities, as painted by Mrs. Arlbery,  with the very singular obligation Camilla owed to his, rose up formidably to  support the arguments and remonstrances of that lady; though every feeling of  Camilla heart, every sentiment of Camilla mind, and every wish of Camilla soul, opposed  their smallest weight.
