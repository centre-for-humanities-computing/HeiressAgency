 Two Retreats  Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold had obeyed the summons of Sir Hugh, whom they found in  extreme tribulation; persuaded by his fears not only of the design of Bellamy,  but of its inevitable success. His brother, however, who knew his alarms to be  generally as unfounded as his hopes; and Mrs. Tyrold, who almost undisguisedly  despised both; no sooner heard his account, than, declining to discuss it, they  sent for Eugenia. She related the transaction with a confusion so innocent,  that it was easy to discern shame alone had hitherto caused her silence; and  with a simplicity so unaffected, that not a doubt could rest upon their minds,  but that her heart was as disengaged as her intentions had been irreproachable.  Yet they were not the less struck with the danger she had incurred; and, while  her father blessed Mandlebert for her preservation, her mother was so sensible  to his care for the family welfare and honour, that the anger she had conceived  against him subsided, though the regret to which it had owed its birth  increased.  Mr. Tyrold gave his daughter some slight cautions and general advice; but  thought it wisest, since he found her tranquil and unsuspicious, not to raise  apprehensions that might disturb her composure, nor awaken ideas of which the  termination must be doubtful.  Her mother deemed the matter to be undeserving the least serious alarm. The man  had appeared to her from the beginning to be a despicable adventurer; and her  lofty contempt of all low arts made her conclude her well-principled Eugenia as  superior to their snares as to their practice.  This conference completely quieted the fears of Sir Hugh; who relinquished his  design of sending for Clermont, and imagined Edgar to have been too severe in  his judgment of Bellamy, who had only knelt in pure compassion, to prevail with  Eugenia to take care of her life.  The rector and his lady were already gone before the cottage group came home.  Edgar was anxious to inquire of Sir Hugh what had passed. The three females,  concluding he had still something to say relative to his proposals, by tacit  agreement, retired to their own rooms.  They were not, however, as concurrent in their eagerness to re-assemble. Miss  Margland and Indiana watched the moment when they might appease their burning  curiosity by descending: but Eugenia wished to prolong her absence, that she  might recover from the embarrassment she had just suffered; and Camilla  determined not to appear again till the next morning.  For the first time in her life after the shortest separation, she forbore to  seek Eugenia, [who] she supposed would have gathered all the particular of the  approaching nuptials. She felt no desire to hear them. It was a period to  which, hitherto, she had looked forward as to a thing of course; but this day  it had struck her that Edgar and Indiana could not be happy together.—She had  even surmised, from his last speech, that he lamented, in secret, the connexion  he had formed.  The gentlest pity took possession of her breast; an increasing admiration  succeeded to her pity. She could not bear to witness so unequal a scene, as the  full satisfaction of Sir Hugh contrasted with the seriousness, perhaps  repentance, of Edgar. She pleaded an head-ache, and went to bed.  The morning did not find her less averse to hear the confirmation of the  suspected news. On the contrary, her repugnance to have it ascertained became  stronger. She did not ask herself why; she did not consider the uselessness of  flying for one hour what she must encounter the next. The present moment was  all she could weigh; and, to procrastinate any evil, seemed, to her ardent and  active imagination, to conquer it. Again, therefore, she planned a visit to  Mrs. Arlbery; though she had given it up so long, from the discouragement of  Lionel, that she felt more of shame than of pleasure in the idea of making so  tardy an apology; but she could think of no other place to which the whole  party would not accompany her; and to avoid them and their communications, for  however short a space of time, was now her sole aim.  Before breakfast, she repaired to the apartment of her uncle; her request was  granted, as soon as heard; and she ordered the chaise.  Indiana and Miss Margland, meanwhile, had learnt from the baronet, that the  proposals were not yet made. Miss Margland softened the disappointment of  Indiana, by suggesting that her admirer was probably waiting the arrival of  some elegant trinket, that he destined to present her upon his declaration: but  she was by no means free from doubt and suspicion herself. She languished to  quit Cleves, and Sir Hugh had almost thought her accountable for the slowness  of Mandlebert's proceedings. To keep up her own consequence, she had again  repeated her assurances, that all was in a prosperous train; though she had  frequently, with strong private uneasiness, observed the eyes of Edgar fixed  upon Camilla, with an attention far more pointed than she had ever remarked in  them when their direction was towards her fair pupil.  Camilla hurried over her breakfast in expectation of the chaise, and in dread  continual, lest her cousin should call her aside, to acquaint her that all was  arranged. Edgar perceived, with surprise, that she was going out alone; and, no  sooner gathered whither, than, drawing her to one of the windows, he earnestly  said: 'Is it by appointment you wait upon Mrs. Arlbery?'  'No.'  'Does she at all expect you this morning?'  'No.'  'Would it, then, be asking too much, if I should entreat you to postpone your  visit for a short time?'  The whole design of Camilla was to absent herself immediately; yet she hated to  say no. She looked disturbed, and was silent.  'Have you made any further acquaintance with her since the morning of the  raffle?'  'No, none; but I wish excessively to know more of her.'  'She is certainly, very—agreeable,' said he, with some hesitation; 'but,  whether she is all Mrs. Tyrold would approve'—  'I hope you know no harm of her?—If you do, pray keep it to yourself!—for  it would quite afflict me to hear anything to her disadvantage.'  'I should be grieved, indeed, to be the messenger of affliction to you; but I  hope there may be no occasion; I only beg a day or two's patience; and, in the  meanwhile, I can give you this assurance; she is undoubtedly a woman of  character. I saw she had charmed you, and I made some immediate inquiries. Her  reputation is without taint.'  'A thousand, thousand thanks,' cried Camilla, gaily, 'for taking so much  trouble; and ten thousand more for finding it needless!'  Edgar could not forbear laughing, but answered, he was not yet so certain it  was needless; since exemption from actual blemish could only be a negative  recommendation: he should very soon, he added, see a lady upon whose judgment  he could rely, and who would frankly satisfy him with respect to some other  particulars, which, he owned, he considered as essential to be known, before  any intimacy should be formed.  Wishing to comply with his request, yet impatient to leave the house, Camilla  stood suspended till the chaise was announced.  'I think,' cried she, with a look and tone of irresolution, 'my going this once  can draw on no ill consequence?'  Edgar only dropt his eyes.  'You are not of that opinion?'  'I have a very particular engagement this morning,' he replied; 'but I will  readily give it up, and ride off instantly to make my application to this lady,  if it is possible you can defer only till tomorrow your visit. Will you suffer  me to ask such a delay? It will greatly oblige me.'  'Why, then,—I will defer it till to-morrow,—or till to-morrow week!' cried  she, wholly vanquished; 'I insist, therefore, that you do not postpone your  business.'  She then desired the servant, who was taking away the breakfast equipage, to  order the chaise to be put up.  Edgar, subdued in his turn, caught her hand: but, instantly, recollecting  himself, hastily let it go; and, throwing up the window sash, abruptly  exclaimed: 'I never saw such fine weather:—I hope it will not rain!'  He then rapidly wished them all good morning, and mounted his horse.  Miss Margland, who, sideling towards the window, on pretence of examining a  print, had heard and seen all that had passed, was almost overpowered with  rage, by the conviction she received that her apprehensions were not  groundless. She feared losing all weight both with the baronet and with  Indiana, if she made this acknowledgment, and retreated, confounded, to her own  room, to consider what path to pursue at so dangerous a crisis; wearing a scowl  upon her face, that was always an indication she would not be followed.  Camilla also went to her chamber, in a perturbation at once pleasing and  painful. She was sorry to have missed her excursion, but she was happy to have  obliged Edgar; she was delighted he could take such interest in her conduct and  affairs, yet dreaded, more than ever, a private conversation with  Indiana;—Indiana, who, every moment, appeared to her less and less calculated  to bestow felicity upon Edgar Mandlebert.  She seated herself at a window, and soon, through the trees, perceived him  galloping away. 'Too—too amiable Edgar!' she cried, earnestly looking after  him, with her hands clasped, and tears starting into her eyes.  Frightened at her own tenderness, she rose, shut the window, and walked to  another end of the apartment.  She took up a book; but she could not read: 'Too—too amiable Edgar!' again  escaped her. She went to her piano-forte; she could not play: 'Too—too  amiable Edgar!' broke forth in defiance of all struggle.  Alarmed and ashamed, even to herself, she resolved to dissipate her ideas by a  long walk; and not to come out of the park, till the first dinner-bell summoned  her to dress.
