 An Helper  The next morning, as Camilla had accompanied Mrs. Arlbery, in earnest  discourse, from her chamber to the hall, she heard the postman say Miss Tyrold  as he gave in a letter. She seized it, saw the hand-writing of Lionel, and ran  eagerly into the parlour, which was empty, to read it, in some hopes it would  at least contain an acknowledgment of the draft, that might be shewn to Sir  Sedley, and relieve her from the pain of continuing the principal in such an  affair.  The letter, however, was merely a sportive rhapsody, beginning; My dear Lady  Clarendel; desiring her favour and protection, and telling her he had done what  he could for her honour, by adding two trophies to the victorious car of Hymen,  driven by the happy Baronet.  Wholly at a loss how to act, she sat ruminating over this letter, till Mrs.  Arlbery opened the door. Having no time to fold it, and dreading her seeing the  first words, she threw her handkerchief, which was then in her hand, over it,  upon the table, hoping presently to draw it away unperceived.  'My dear friend,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'I am glad to see you a moment alone. Do  you know any thing of Mandlebert?'  'No!' answered she affrighted, lest any evil had happened.  'Did he not take leave of you at the Rooms the other night?'  'Leave of me? is he gone any where?'  'He has left Tunbridge.'  Camilla remained stupified.  'Left it,' she continued, 'without the poor civility of a call, to ask if you  had any letters or messages for Hampshire.'  Camilla coloured high; she felt to her heart this evident coldness, and she  knew it to be still more marked than Mrs. Arlbery could divine; for he was  aware she wished particularly to speak with him; and though she had failed in  her appointment, he had not inquired why.  'And this is the man for whom you would relinquish all mankind? this is the  grateful character who is to render you insensible to every body?'  The disturbed mind of Camilla needed not this speech; her debt to Sir Sedley,  cast wholly upon herself by the thoughtless Lionel; her inability to pay it,  the impressive lines the Baronet had addressed to her, and the cruel and  pointed indifference of Edgar, all forcibly united to make her wish, at this  moment, her heart at her own disposal.  In a few minutes, the voice of Sir Sedley, gaily singing, caught her ear. He  was entering the hall, the street door being open. She started up; Mrs. Arlbery  would have detained her, but she could not endure to encounter him, and without  returning his salutation, or listening to his address, crossed him in the hall,  and flew up stairs.  There, however, she had scarcely taken breath, when she recollected the letter  which she had left upon the table, and which the afflicting intelligence that  Edgar had quitted Tunbridge, had made her forget she had received. In a terror  immeasurable, lest her handkerchief should be drawn aside, and betray the first  line, she re-descended the stairs, and hastily entered the room. Her shock was  then inexpressible. The handkerchief, which her own quick motion in retiring  had displaced, was upon the floor, the letter was in full view; the eyes of Sir  Sedley were fixed upon his own name, with a look indefinable between pleasure  and impertinence, and Mrs. Arlbery was laughing with all her might.  She seized the letter, and was running away with it, when Mrs. Arlbery slipt  out of the room, and Sir Sedley, shutting the door, half archly, half tenderly  repeated, from the letter, 'My dear Lady Clarendel!'  In a perfect agony, she hid her face, exclaiming: 'O Lionel! my foolish ...  cruel brother!...'  'Not foolish, not cruel, I think him,' cried Sir Sedley, taking her hand, 'but  amiable ... he has done honour to my name, and he will use it, I hope,  henceforth, as his own.'  'Forget, forget his flippancy,' cried she, withdrawing impatiently her hand;  'and pardon his sister's breach of engagement for this morning. I hope soon,  very soon, to repair it, and I hope....'  She did not know what to add; she stopt, stammered, and then endeavoured to  make her retreat.  'Do not go,' cried he, gently detaining her; 'incomparable Camilla! I have a  thousand things to say to you. Will you not hear them?'  'No!' cried she, disengaging herself; 'no, no, no! I can hear nothing!...'  'Do you fascinate then,' said he, half reproachfully, 'like the rattlesnake,  only to destroy?'  Camilla conceived this as alluding to her recent encouragement, and stood  trembling with expectation it would be followed by a claim upon her justice.  But Sir Sedley, who was far from any meaning so pointed, lightly added; 'What  thus agitates the fairest of creatures? can she fear a poor captive entangled  in the witchery of her loveliness, and only the more enslaved the more he  struggles to get free?'  'Let me go,' cried she, eager to stop him; 'I beseech you, Sir Sedley!'  'All beauteous Camilla!' said he, retreating yet still so as to intercept her  passage; 'I am bound to submit; but when may I see you again?'  'At any time,' replied she hastily; 'only let me pass now!'  'At any time! adorable Camilla! be it then to-night! be it this evening!... be  it at noon!... be it....'  'No, no, no, no!' cried she, panting with shame and alarm; 'I do not mean at  any time! I spoke without thought ... I mean....'  'Speak so ever and anon,' cried he, 'if thought is my enemy! This evening  then....'  He stopt, as if irresolute how to finish his phrase, but soon added: 'Adieu,  till this evening, adieu!' and opened the door for her to pass.  Triumph sat in his eye; exultation spoke in every feature; yet his voice  betrayed constraint, and seemed checked, as if from fear of entrusting it with  his sentiments. The fear, however, was palpably not of diffidence with respect  to Camilla, but of indecision with regard to himself.  Camilla, almost sinking with shame now hung back, from a dread of leaving him  in this dangerous delusion. She sat down, and in a faltering voice, said: 'Sir  Sedley! hear me, I beg!...'  'Hear you?' cried he, gallantly casting himself at her feet; 'yes! from the  fervid rays of the sun, to the mild lustre of the moon!... from....'  A loud knock at the street door, and a ringing at the same time at the bell,  made him rise, meaning to shut again the door of the parlour, but he was  prevented by the entrance of a man into the hall, calling out, in a voice that  reached to every part of the house, 'An express for Miss Camilla Tyrold.'  Camilla started up, concluding it some strange intelligence concerning Edgar.  But a letter was put into her hand, and she saw it was the writing of Lavinia.  It was short, but most affectionate. It told her that news was just arrived  from the Continent, which gave reason for hourly expectation of their cousin  Lynmere at Cleves, in consequence of which Sir Hugh was assembling all the  family to receive him. She was then, with her father, going thither from  Etherington, where the restored health of her uncle had, for a week past,  enabled them to reside, and she was ordered to send off an express to  Tunbridge, to beg Camilla would prepare immediately for the post-chaise of Sir  Hugh, which would be sent for her, with the Cleves housekeeper, and reach Mount  Pleasant within a few hours after this notice.  A hundred questions assailed Camilla when she had run over this letter, the  noise of the express having brought Mrs. Arlbery and the Dennels into the  parlour.  She produced the letter, and putting it in the hands of Mrs. Arlbery, relieved  her painful confusion, by quitting the room without again meeting the eyes of  Sir Sedley.  She could make no preparation, however, for her journey, from mingled desire  and fear of an explanation with the Baronet before her departure.  Again, therefore, in a few minutes she went down; gathering courage from the  horror of a mistake that might lead to so much mischief.  She found only Mrs. Arlbery in the parlour.  Involuntarily staring, 'Where,' she cried, 'is Sir Sedley?'  'He is gone,' answered Mrs. Arlbery, laughing at her earnestness; 'but no doubt  you will soon see him at Cleves.'  'Then I am undone!' cried she, bursting into tears, and running back to her  chamber.  Mrs. Arlbery instantly followed, and kindly inquired what disturbed her.  'O, Mrs. Arlbery!' she cried, 'lend me, I beseech you, some aid, and spare me,  in pity, your raillery! Sir Sedley, I fear, greatly mistakes me; set him right,  I conjure you....'  'Me, my dear? and do you think if some happy fatality is at work at this moment  to force you to your good, I will come forth, like your evil genius, to  counteract its operations?'  'I must write, then ... yet, in this haste, this confusion, I fear to involve  rather than extricate myself!'  'Ay, write by all means; there is nothing so prettily forwards these affairs,  as a correspondence between the parties undertaken to put an end to them.'  She went, laughing, out of the chamber, and Camilla, who had seized a pen,  distressfully flung it from her.  What indeed could she say? he had made no direct declaration; she could give,  therefore, no direct repulse; and though, through her brother's cruel want of  all consideration, she was so deeply in his debt, she durst no longer promise  its discharge; for the strange departure of Edgar robbed her of all courage to  make to him her meditated application.  Yet to leave Sir Sedley in this errour was every way terrible. If, which still  seemed very possible, from his manner and behaviour, he should check his  partiality, and make the whole of what had passed end in mere public-place  gallantry, she must always have the mortification to know he had considered her  as ready to accept him: If, on the contrary, encouraging what he felt for her,  from the belief she returned his best opinion, he should seriously demand her  hand ... how could she justify the apparent attention she once paid him? and  how assert, while so hopelessly his debtor, the independence to reject one who  so many ways seemed to hold himself secure?  She was broken in upon by Mrs. Mittin, who entered full of lamentation at the  intelligence she had just heard from Miss Dennel of her sudden departure; which  she ended with, 'But as you are going in such haste, my dear, you must have  fifty things to do, so pray now, let me help you. Come, what shall I pack up  for you? Where's all your things?'  Camilla, incapable of doing any business for herself, accepted the offer.  'Well then, now where's your gowns? Bless me! what a one is here? why it's been  in the dew, and then in the dust, and then in the dew again, till all the  bottom must be cut off; why you can never shew it amongst your friends; it will  quite bring a disgrace upon poor Tunbridge; come, I think you must give it to  me; I've got a piece of muslin just like it, and I can piece it so that it  won't appear; but it will never do for you again.'  Camilla was surprised; but her mind was filled with other matters, and the gown  was put apart.  'What! are those all your neck handkerchiefs? why, my dear Miss Tyrold, that's  a thing you want very bad indeed; why here's one you can never wear again; it  wants more darning than it's worth.'  Camilla said she should have very good time to mend it at home.  'But then, my dear, you don't consider what a bad look that will have amongst  your friends; what will they think of poor Tunbridge, that you should have let  it go so far? why, may be they'll never let you come again; the best way will  be not to let them see it; suppose I take it off your hands? I dare say they  don't know your count.'  At any other time, Camilla would either have resisted these seizures, or have  been diverted by the pretence that they were made only for her own benefit; but  she was now glad at any rate to get rid of the care of the package.  When this was over, and Mrs. Mittin had pretty well paid herself for her  trouble: 'Well, my dear,' she cried, 'and what can I do for you next? Have you  paid Mrs. Tillden, and Mr. Doust, and Mr. Tent?'  These were questions that indeed roused Camilla from her reverie; she had not  once thought of what she owed to the milliner, to her shoemaker, nor to her  haberdasher; from all of whom she had now, through the hands of Mrs. Mittin,  had various articles. She thanked her for reminding her of so necessary an  attention, and said she would immediately send for the bills.  'I'll run and pay 'em for you myself,' said Mrs. Mittin; 'for they always take  that kind; and as I recommended them all to you, I have a right they should  know how I stand their friend; for there's many an odd service they may do me  in return; so I'll go for you with all my heart; only give me the money.'  Camilla took out her purse, in which, from her debt to Sir Sedley, and  perpetually current expences, there now remained but fifteen shillings of her  borrowed five guineas; though latterly, she had wholly denied herself whatever  did not seem an expence unavoidable. What to do she now knew not; for though  all she had ordered had been trifling, she was sure it must amount to four or  five guineas. She had repeatedly refused to borrow anything more of Mrs.  Arlbery, always hoping every call for money would be the last; but she was too  inexperienced to know, that in gay circles, and public places, the demands for  wealth are endless and countless; and that œconomy itself, which is always  local, is there lavish and extravagant, compared with its character, in private  scenes and retired life.  Yet was this the last moment to apply to Mrs. Arlbery upon such a subject,  since it would be endowing her with fresh arms to fight the cause of Sir  Sedley. She sat still, and ruminating, till Mrs. Mittin, who without scruple  had taken a full inventory of the contents of the purse, exclaimed: 'La! my  dear, why sure I hope that i'n't all you've got left?'  Camilla was fain to confess she had nothing more at Tunbridge.  'Well, don't be uneasy, my dear,' cried she, 'and I'll go to 'em all, and be  caution for you, till you get the money.'  Camilla thanked her very sincerely, and again resumed her first opinion of her  real good nature, and kindness of heart. She took her direction in London,  whither she was soon to return, and promised, in a short time, to transmit the  money for her to distribute, as every one of the shopkeepers went to the  metropolis in the winter.  Delighted both with the praise and the commission, Mrs. Mittin took leave; and  Camilla determined to employ her next quarter's allowance in paying these  debts, and frankly to beg from her uncle the five guineas that were due to Mrs.  Arlbery.  She then wrote an affectionate adieu to Mrs. Berlinton, intreating to hear from  her at Etherington; and, while she was sealing it, Mrs. Arlbery came to embrace  her, as the carriage was at the door.  Camilla, in making her acknowledgments for the kindness she had received,  intermingled a petition, that at least, she would not augment, if she refused  to clear the mistake of Sir Sedley.  'I believe he may safely,' she answered, 'be left to himself; though it is  plain that, at this moment, he is in a difficulty as great as your own; for  marriage he still resists, though he finds you resistless. I wish you mutually  to be parted till ... pardon me, my fair friend ... your understandings are  mutually cleared, and he is divested of what is too factitious, and you of what  is too artless. Your situation is, indeed, rather whimsical; for the two  mortals with whom you have to deal require treatment diametrically opposite;  yet, humour them a little adroitly, and you presently gain them both. He that  is proud, must be distanced; he that is vain, must be flattered. This is paying  them with their own coin; but they hold no other to be current. Pride, if not  humbled, degenerates into contempt; vanity, if not indulged, dissolves into  indifference.'  Camilla disclaimed taking any measures with respect to either; but Mrs. Arlbery  insisted the field would be won by Sir Sedley, 'who is already,' she cried,  'persuaded you have for some time encouraged him, and that now you are fully  propitious....'  Camilla hastily interrupted her: 'O, Mrs. Arlbery!' she cried, 'I cannot endure  this! add not to my disturbance by making it my own work!'  She then embraced her; took leave of the Dennels, and with the housekeeper of  Sir Hugh set out from Tunbridge for Cleves.  END OF THE THIRD VOLUME.  VOLUME IV  BOOK VII
