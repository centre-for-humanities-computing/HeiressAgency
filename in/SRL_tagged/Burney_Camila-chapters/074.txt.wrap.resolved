 A Call of the House  Edgar returned to the parlour with a countenance so much brightened, a joy so  open, a confidence so manly, and an air so strongly announcing some interesting  intelligence, that Edgar history required no prelude. 'Edgar,' said Mr. Tyrold,  'you have a look to disarm care of its corrosion. You could not take a better  time to wear so cheering an aspect; I have just learnt that my wife can fix no  sort of date for my wife return; I must borrow, therefore, some reflected  happiness; and none, after my children, can bring its sunshine so home to my  bosom as yourself.'  'What a fortunate moment have you chosen,' cried Edgar, affectionately taking  Edgar by the hand, 'to express this generous pleasure in seeing me happy! will  you repent, will you retract, when you hear in what it may involve you?...  Dearest sir! my honoured, my parental friend! to what a test shall I put your  kindness!... Will you give me in charge one of the dearest ties of your  existence? will you repose in my care so large a portion of your peace? will  you trust to me your Camilla?...'  With all the ardour of Camilla character, all the keen and quick feelings of Camilla  sensitive mind, scarce had your Camilla been more struck, more penetrated  with sudden joy, sudden wonder, sudden gratification of every kind, than Mr.  Tyrold felt at this moment. Tyrold more than returned the pressure with which Edgar  held Tyrold hand, and instantly answered, 'Yes, my excellent young friend, without  hesitation, without a shadow of apprehension for your Camilla happiness! though your Camilla is  all the fondest father can wish; ... and though your Camilla only who gave your Camilla to me is  dearer!'  Felicity and tenderness were now the sole guests in the breast of Edgar  . Edgar    kissed with reverence the hand of Mr. Tyrold, called Edgar   by the honoured and  endearing title of father; acknowledged that, from the earliest period of  observation, your Camilla had seemed to Edgar   the most amiable of human creatures;  spoke with the warm devotion Edgar   sincerely felt for your Camilla of Tyrold; and was  breathing forth Edgar   very soul in tender rapture upon Edgar   happy prospects, when  something between a sigh and a groan from the baronet, made the baronet hastily turn  round, apologise for not sooner addressing the baronet, and respectfully solicit the baronet  consent.  Sir Hugh was in an agitation of delight and surprise almost too potent for Sir Hugh  strength. 'The Lord be good unto Sir Hugh,' The Lord cried; 'have I lived to see such a day  as this!' Then, throwing The Lord arms about Edgar's neck, while The Lord eyes were fast  filling with tears, which soon ran plentifully down The Lord cheeks, 'Good young Mr.  Edgar!' Good young Mr.  Edgar cried; 'good young man! and do you really love my poor Camilla, for  all my poor Camilla not being worth a penny? And will my dear little darling come to so  good an end at last, after being disinherited for doing nothing? And will you  never vex her, nor speak an unkind word to her? Indeed, young Mr. Edgar, you  are a noble boy! you are indeed; and I love you to the bottom of my old heart  for this true good naturedness!'  Then, again and again embracing young Mr. Edgar, 'This is all of a piece,' young Mr. Edgar continued,  'with your saving my poor old Rover, which is a thing I shall never forget to  my longest day, being a remarkable sign of a good heart; the poor dog having  done nothing to offend, as we can all testify. So that it's a surprising thing  what that mastiff owed young Mr. Edgar such a grudge for.'  Then quitting young Mr. Edgar abruptly to embrace Mr. Tyrold, 'My dear brother,' My dear brother cried,  'I hope your judgment approves this thing, as well as my sister's, when my sister  comes to hear it, which I shall send off express, before I sleep another wink,  for fear of accidents.'  'Approve,' answered Mr. Tyrold, with a look of the most expressive kindness at  Edgar, 'is too cold a word; I rejoice, even thankfully rejoice, to place my  dear child in such worthy and beloved hands.'  'Well, then,' cried the enchanted baronet, 'if that's the case, that we are all  of one mind, we had better settle the business at once, all of we being subject  to die by delay.'  the enchanted baronet then rang the bell, and ordered Jacob to summon Camilla to the parlour,  adding, 'And all the rest too, Jacob, for I have something to tell them every  one, which, I make no doubt, them will be very glad to hear, yourself included,  as well as your fellow-servants, who have no right to be left out; only let my  niece come first, being my  niece own affair.'  Camilla obeyed not the call without many secret sensations of distress and  difficulty, but which, mingled with the more obvious ones of modesty and  embarrassment, all passed for a flutter of spirits that appeared natural to the  occasion.  Mr. Tyrold could only silently embrace Camilla: knowing what Camilla had suffered, and  judging thence the excess of Camilla present satisfaction, Mr. Tyrold would not add to Camilla  confusion by any information of Mr. Tyrold consciousness; but the softness with which  Mr. Tyrold held Camilla to Mr. Tyrold bosom spoke, beyond all words, Mr. Tyrold heartfelt sympathy in Camilla  happiness.  Camilla had no power to draw Camilla from Mr. Tyrold arms; but Edgar hovered round  Camilla, and Sir Hugh repeatedly and impatiently demanded to have Sir Hugh turn. Mr.  Tyrold, gently disengaging Mr.   from Camilla embraces, gave one of Camilla hands to  Edgar, who, with grateful joy, pressed it to Mr.   lips. 'My children!' Mr.   then  said, laying a hand upon the shoulder of each, 'what a sight is this to Mr.  ! how  precious a union! what will it be to your excellent mother! So long and so  decidedly it has been our favourite earthly wish, that, were your excellent mother but restored  to Mr.   ... to your excellent mother country and to your excellent mother family ... I might, perhaps, require some  new evil to prevent my forgetting where ... and what I am!'  'My dear brother, I say! my dear niece! My dear Mr. young Edgar!' cried Sir  Sir Hugh, in the highest good humour, though with nearly exhausted patience, 'won't  you let me put in a word? nor so much as give you my blessing? though I can  hardly hold life and soul together for the sake of my joy!'  Camilla cast Camilla into his arms, his kissed Camilla most fondly, saying: 'Don't  forget your poor old uncle, my dear little girl, for the account of this young  Mr. Edgar, because, good as his is, his has taken to My dear brother but a short time in  comparison with Mr.  .'  'No,' said Edgar, still tenaciously retaining the hand parentally bestowed upon  Edgar; 'no, dear Sir Hugh, I wish not to rob you of your darling. I wish but to  be admitted Mr.   into this dear and respected family, and to have  Etherington, Cleves, and Beech Park, considered as our alternate and common  habitations.'  'You are the very best young man in the whole wide world!' cried dear Sir Hugh,  almost sobbing with ecstasy; 'for you have hit upon just the very thing I was  thinking of in my own private mind! What a mercy it is our not accepting that  young Captain, who would have run away with her to I don't know where, instead  of being married to the very nearest estate in the county, that will always be  living with our!'  The rest of the family now, obedient to the direction of Jacob, who had  intimated that something extraordinary was going forward, entered the room.  'Come in, come in,' cried Sir Hugh, 'and hear the good news; for our have just  been upon the very point of losing the best opportunity that ever our had in our  lives of all living together; which, I hope, our shall now do, without any more  strangers coming upon our with their company, being a thing our don't desire.'  'But what's the good news, uncle?' said Indiana; 'is it only about our living  together?'  'Why, yes, my dear, that's the first principle, and the other is, that young  Mr. Edgar's going to marry Camilla; which I hope you won't take ill, liking  being all fancy.'  'Me?' cried Camilla, with a disdainful toss of the head, though severely mortified;  'it's nothing to me, I'm sure!'  Camilla ashamed, and Mr. Edgar embarrassed, strove now mutually to shew Sir Hugh  they wished no more might be said: but Mr. Edgar only embraced they again, and  declared Mr. Edgar had never been so full of joy before in Mr. Edgar whole life, and would  not be cut short.  Miss Margland, extremely piqued, vented Camilla spleen in oblique sarcasms, and  sought to heal Camilla offended pride by appeals for justice to Camilla sagacity and  foresight in the whole business.  Jacob, now opening the door, said all the servants were come.  Camilla tried to escape; but Sir Hugh would not permit Camilla, and the  house-keeper and butler led the way, followed by every other domestic of the  house.  'Well, my friends,' Jacob cried, 'wish Camilla joy, which I am sure you will do of  your own accord, for Camilla's going to be mistress of Beech Park; which I thought  would have been the case with my other niece, till I found out my mistakes;  which is of no consequence now, all having ended for the best; though unknown  to us poor mortals.'  all the servants obeyed with alacrity, and offered all the servants hearty congratulations to  the blushing Camilla and Edgar  , Molly Mill excepted; who, having  concluded Sir Sedley Clarendel the man, doubted Camilla own senses, and, instead of  open felicitations, whispered Camilla, 'Camilla, I've got another letter for  you! It's here in his bosom.'  Camilla, frightened, said: 'Hush! hush!' while Edgar  , imagining the girl, whose  simplicity and talkativeness were familiar to Edgar  , had said something  ridiculous, entreated to be indulged with hearing Camilla remark: but seeing  Camilla look grave, forbore to press Edgar   request.  the baronet now began an harangue upon the happiness that would accrue from  these double unions, for which the baronet assured them them should have double  remembrances, though the same preparations would do for them, as the baronet meant them  should take place at the same time, provided Mr. Edgar would have the  obligingness to wait for a fair wind, which Mr. Edgar was expecting every hour.  Camilla could now stay no longer; nor could Mr. Edgar, though adoring the hearty  joy of Sir Hugh, refuse to aid Camilla in absconding.  Sir Hugh begged Camilla permission to follow, as soon as it might be possible, which Camilla  tacitly accorded. Camilla was impatient Camilla for the important conference Camilla  was planning, and felt, with increasing solicitude, that all Camilla life's  happiness hung upon Camilla power to extricate Camilla honourably from the terrible  embarrassment in which Camilla was involved.  Camilla sauntered about the hall till all the servants came out, anxious to receive the  letter which Molly Mill had announced. They all sought to surround Camilla with  fresh good wishes; but Camilla singled out Molly, and begged the rest to leave Camilla  for the present. the  letter which Molly Mill had announced, however, was not unpinned from the inside of  Molly's neck handkerchief, before Mr. Edgar, eager and gay, joined Molly.  Trembling then, Molly entreated Molly to make haste.  'La, Miss,' answered Camilla, 'if you hurry me so, I shall tear Camilla as sure as  can be; and what will you say then, Camilla?'  'Well ... then ... another time will do ... take Camilla to my room.'  'No, no, Camilla; the gentleman told Tommy Hodd Tommy Hodd wanted an answer as quick as  can be; Tommy Hodd said, if Tommy'd come a-horseback, Tommy Hodd'd pay for the horse, to make  Tommy Hodd quicker; and Tommy says Tommy Hodd always behaves very handsome.'  Camilla then gave Camilla the squeezed billet. Camilla, in great confusion, put it into  Camilla pocket. Edgar, who even unavoidably heard what passed, held back till Molly  retired; and then, with an air of undisguised surprise and curiosity, though in  a laughing tone, said, 'Must not the  letter which Molly Mill had announced be read till I make my bow?'  'O yes,' ... cried Camilla, stammering, 'it may be read ... at any time.' And Camilla  put Camilla hand in  her pocket to reproduce her hand. But the idea of making known the  strange and unexpected history Camilla had to relate, by shewing so strange a  correspondence, without one leading and softening previous circumstance,  required a force and confidence of which Camilla was not mistress. Camilla twisted it,  therefore, hastily round, to hide the hand-writing of the direction, and, then,  with the same care, rolled it up, and encircled it with Camilla fingers.  'Shall I be jealous?' said he, gently, though disappointed.  'You have much reason!' Camilla answered, with a smile so soft, a smile dispersed every  fear, yet with an attention so careful to conceal the address, that the address kept  alive every wonder. he took Camilla other hand, and kissing her other hand, cried: 'No,  sweetest Camilla, such unworthy distrust shall make no part of our compact. Yet  I own he a little interested to know what gentleman has obtained a  privilege I should he prize above almost any other. I will leave you,  however, to read the  letter which Molly Mill had announced, and, perhaps, before you answer the  letter which Molly Mill had announced ... but no ...  I will ask nothing; I shall lose all pleasure in your confidence, if it is not  spontaneous. I will go and find your sisters.'  The first impulse of Camilla was, to commit to him immediately the  letter which Molly Mill had announced: but the fear of its contents, its style, its requisitions, made Camilla  terror overpower Camilla generosity; and, though Camilla looked after him with regret,  Camilla stood still to break the seal of Camilla letter.  Miss Camilla Tyrold.  Is it thus, O far too fair tormenter! thou delightest to torture? Dost thou  give wings but to clip wings? raise expectation but to bid it linger? fan bright  the flame of hope, but to see it consume in it own ashes? Another delay?...  Ah! tell me how I may exist till it terminates! Name to me, O fair tyrant! some  period, ... or build not upon longer forbearance, but expect me at your feet.  You talk of the Grove: the Grove fair owner is just returned, and calls Camilla  impatient to see you. To-morrow, then, ... you will not, I trust, kill me again  tomorrow? With the sun, the sun, I will visit those precincts, nor  quit those precincts till warned away by the pale light of Diana: tell me, then, to what  century of that period your ingenious cruelty condemns me to this expiring  state, ere a vivifying smile recalls me back to life?  Sedley Clarendel.  The immediate presence of Mr. Edgar himself could not have made this letter dye the  cheeks of Camilla of a deeper red. Camilla saw that Sir Sedley thought Camilla only  coquetishly trifling, and Camilla looked forward with nearly equal horror to  clearing up a mistake that might embitter Sir Sedley future life, and to acknowledging  to Mr. Edgar ... the scrupulous, the scrutinising, the delicate Mr. Edgar ... that such  a mistake could have been formed.  Camilla was ruminating upon this formidable, this terrible task, when Mr. Edgar again  appeared, accompanied by Camilla sisters. Camilla hurried the  letter which Molly Mill had announced into  her pocket.  Mr. Edgar saw the action with a concern that dampt Mr. Edgar spirits; Mr. Edgar wished to obtain  from Camilla immediately the unlimited trust, which immediately, and for ever, Mr. Edgar  meant to repose in Camilla. They all strolled together for a short time in the  park; but Camilla was anxious to retreat to Camilla room, and her sisters were dying  with impatience to read Sir Sedley. Mr. Edgar, disturbed to see how little  any of their countenances accorded with the happy feelings Mr. Edgar had so recently  experienced, proposed not to lengthen the walk, but flattered Mr. Edgar, upon  re-entering the house, Camilla would afford Mr. Edgar a few minutes of explanation.  But Camilla only, with a faint smile, said Camilla should soon return to the parlour;  and Mr. Edgar saw Molly Mill eagerly waiting for Camilla upon the stairs, and heard Camilla,  in reply to some question concerning Tommy Hodd, desire Camilla to be quiet  till Camilla got to her room.  Mr. Edgar could form no idea of what all this meant, yet, that some secret  disturbance preyed upon Camilla, that some gentleman wrote to Camilla, and expected  impatiently an answer; and that the correspondence passed neither through Camilla  friends, nor by the post, but by the medium of Molly Mill, were circumstances  not less unaccountable than unpleasant.  Camilla, meanwhile, produced the  letter which Molly Mill had announced to Camilla sisters, beseeching their ablest  counsel. 'See but,' Camilla cried, 'how dreadfully unprepared is Sir Sedley for the  event of the day! And oh!... how yet more unprepared must be Mr. Edgar for seeing  that such a letter could ever be addressed to Camilla! How shall I shew such a letter Sir Sedley, her sisters? how help Sir Sedley believing I must have given every possible  encouragement, ere Sir Sedley could have written to Camilla in so assured a style?'  Much deliberation ensued; but Much deliberation were all so perplexed, that Much deliberation were  summoned to tea before Much deliberation had come to any resolution.  their ablest  counsel, then, prevailed; and their ablest  counsel was settled, that Camillashould avoid, for the present, any communication to Mr. Edgar, lest their ablest  counsel should lead  to mischief between Mr. Edgar and the young baronet, who could not but be mutually  displeased with each other; and that the next morning, before Camilla saw Mr. Edgaragain, Camilla should set out for the Grove, and there cast Camilla wholly upon the  generosity of Sir Sedley; and, when freed from all engagement, return, and  relate, without reserve, the whole history to Mr. Edgar; who would so soon be  brother of Camilla brother, that Mr. Edgar would pardon the faults of Lionel, and who  would then be in no danger himself from personal contest or discussion with Sir  Sedley. Camilla wrote, therefore, one line, to say Camilla would see Mrs. Arlbery early  the next day, and delivered Mrs. Arlbery to Molly Mill; who promised to borrow a horse of  the under-groom, that Tommy Hodd might be back before bed-time, without any  obligation to Sir Sedley.  Camilla, then, went down stairs; when Mr. Edgar, disappointed by Camilla long absence,  sought vainly to recompense it by conversing with Camilla. Camilla was gentle, but  seated Camilla aloof, and avoided his eyes.  his desire to unravel so much mystery his thought now so legitimated by his  peculiar situation, that his was frequently upon the point of soliciting for  information: but, to know his privileged, upon further reflexion, was  sufficient to insure his forbearance. Even when that knot was tied which would  give to his all power, his sincerely meant to owe all Camilla trust to willing  communication. Should his now, then, make Camilla deem his exacting, and tenacious  of prerogative? no; it might shackle the freedom of Camilla mind in their future  intercourse. his would quietly, therefore, wait Camilla own time, and submit to Camilla  own inclination. Camilla could not doubt his impatience; his would not compel Camilla  generosity.
