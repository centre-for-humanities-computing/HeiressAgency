 A Bride's Resolves  With every allowance for a grief in which so deeply he shared, Mr. Tyrold felt  nearly bowed down with sorrow, when he observed his own tenderness abate of its  power to console, and his exhortations of their influence with his miserable  daughter, whose complicated afflictions seemed desperate to herself, and to him  nearly hopeless.  He now began to fear the rigid œconomy and retirement of their present lives  might add secret disgust or fatigue to the disappointment of her heart. He  sighed at an idea so little in unison with all that had hitherto appeared of  her disposition; yet remembered she was very young and very lively, and thought  that, if caught by a love of gayer scenes than Etherington afforded, she was at  a season of life which brings its own excuse for such venial ambition.  He mentioned, therefore, with great kindness, their exclusion from all society,  and proposed making an application to Mrs. Needham, a lady high in the esteem  of Mrs. Tyrold, to have the goodness to take the charge of carrying them a  little into the world, during the absence of their mother. 'I can neither exact  nor desire,' he said, 'to sequester you from all amusement for a term so  utterly indefinite as that of her restoration; since it is now more than ever  desirable to regain the favour of your uncle Relvil for Lionel, who has  resisted every profession for which I have sought to prepare him; though his  idle and licentious courses so little fit him for contentment with the small  patrimony he will one day inherit.'  The sisters mutually and sincerely declined this proposition; Lavinia had too  much employment to find time ever slow of passage; and Camilla, joined to the  want of all spirit for recreation, had a dread of appearing in the county, lest  she should meet with Sir Sedley Clarendel, whose two hundred pounds were  amongst the evils ever present to her. The money which Eugenia meant to save  for this account had all been given to Lionel; and now her marriage was at an  end, and no particular sum expected, she must be very long in replacing it;  especially as Jacob was first to be considered; though he had kindly protested  he was in no haste to be paid.  Mr. Tyrold was not sorry to have his proposition declined; yet saw the sadness  of Camilla unabated, and suggested, for a transient diversity, a visit to the  Grove; enquiring why an acquaintance begun with so much warmth and pleasure,  seemed thus utterly relinquished. Camilla had herself thought with shame of her  apparently ungrateful neglect of Mrs. Arlbery; but the five guineas she had  borrowed, and forgotten to pay, while she might yet have asked them of Sir  Hugh, and which now she had no ability any where to raise, made the idea of  meeting with her painful. And thus, overwhelmed with regret and repentance for  all around, her spirits gone, and her heart sunk, she desired never more,  except for Cleves, to stir from Etherington.  Had he seen the least symptom of her revival, Mr. Tyrold would have been  gratified by her strengthened love of home; but this was far from being the  case; and, upon the marriage of Miss Dennel, which was now celebrated, he was  glad of an opportunity to force her abroad, from the necessity of making a  congratulatory visit to the bride's aunt, Mrs. Arlbery.  The chariot, therefore, of Sir Hugh being borrowed, she was compelled into this  exertion; which was ill repaid by her reception from Mrs. Arlbery, who, hurt as  well as offended by her long absence and total silence, wore an air of the most  chilling coldness. Camilla felt sorry and ashamed; but too much disturbed to  attempt any palliation for her non-appearance, and remissness of even a note or  message.  The room was full of morning visitors, all collected for the same complimentary  purpose; but she was relieved with respect to her fears of Sir Sedley  Clarendel, in hearing of his tour to the Hebrides.  Her mournful countenance soon, however, dispersed the anger of Mrs. Arlbery.  'What,' cried she, 'has befallen you, my fair friend? if you are not  immeasurably unhappy, you are very seriously ill.'  'Yes,—no,—my spirits—have not been good—' answered she,  stammering;—'but yours may, perhaps, assist to restore them.'  The composition of Mrs. Arlbery had no particle of either malice or vengeance;  she now threw off, therefore, all reserve, and taking her by the hand, said:  'shall I keep you to spend the day with me? Yes, or no? Peace or war?'  And without waiting for an answer, she sent back the chariot, and a message to  Mr. Tyrold, that she would carry home his daughter in the evening.  'And now, my faithless Fair,' cried she, as soon as they were alone, 'tell me  what has led you to this abominable fickleness? with me, I mean! If you had  grown tired of any body else, I should have thought nothing so natural. But you  know, I suppose, that the same thing we philosophise into an admirable good  joke for our neighbours, we moralise into a crime against ourselves.'  'I thought,' said Camilla, attempting to smile, 'none but country cousins ever  made apologies?'  'Nay, now, I must forgive you without one word more!' answered Mrs. Arlbery,  laughing, and shaking hands with her; 'a happy citation of one bon mot, is  worth any ten offences. So, you see, you have nine to commit, in store, clear  of all damages. But the pleasure of finding one has not said a good thing only  for once, thence to be forgotten and die away in the winds, is far greater than  you can yet awhile conceive. In the first pride of youth and beauty, our  attention is all upon how we are looked at. But when those begin to be somewhat  on the wane—when that barbarous time comes into play, which revenges upon  poor miserable woman all the airs she has been playing upon silly man—our  ambition, then, is how we are listened to. So now, cutting short reproach and  excuse, and all the wearying round of explanation, tell me a little of your  history since we last met.'  This was the last thing Camilla meant to undertake: but she began, in a  hesitating manner, to speak of her little debt. Mrs. Arlbery, eagerly  interrupting her, insisted it should not be mentioned; adding: 'I go on vastly  well again; I am breaking in two ponies, and building a new phaeton; and I  shall soon pay for both, without the smallest inconvenience,—except just  pinching my servants, and starving my visitors. But tell me something of your  adventures. You are not half so communicative as Rumour, which has given me a  thousand details of you, and married you and your whole set to at least half a  dozen men a piece, since you were last at the Grove. Amongst others, it  asserts, that my old Lord Valhurst was seriously at your feet? That prating  Mrs. Mittin, who fastened upon my poor little niece at Tunbridge, and who is  now her factotum, pretends that my lord's own servants spoke of it publicly at  Mrs. Berlinton's.'  This was a fact that, being thus divulged, a very few questions made impossible  to deny; though Camilla was highly superior to the indelicacy and ingratitude  of repaying the preference of any gentleman by publishing his rejection.  'And what in the world, my dear child,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'could provoke you  to so wild an action as refusing him?'  'Good Heaven, Mrs. Arlbery!'  'O, what—you were not in love with him? I believe not!—but if he was in  love with you, take my word for it, that would have done quite as well. 'Tis  such a little while that same love lasts, even when it is begun with, that you  have but a few months to lose, to be exactly upon a par with those who set out  with all the quivers of Cupid, darting from heart to heart. He has still  fortune enough left for a handsome settlement; you can't help outliving him,  and then, think but how delectable would be your situation! Freedom, money at  will, the choice of your own friends, and the enjoyment of your own humour!'  'You would but try me, my dear Mrs. Arlbery; for you cannot, I'm sure, believe  me capable of making so solemn an engagement for such mercenary hopes, and  selfish purposes.'  'This is all the romance of false reasoning. You have not sought the man, but  the man you. You would not have solicited his acceptance, but yielded to his  solicitation of yours. The balance is always just, where force is not used. The  man has his reasons for chusing you; you have your reasons for suffering  yourself to be chosen. What his are, you have no business to enquire; nor has  he the smallest right to investigate yours.'  This was by no means the style in which Camilla had been brought up to think of  marriage; and Mrs. Arlbery presently added: 'You are grave? yet I speak but as  a being of the world I live in: though I address one that knows nothing about  it. Tell me, however, a little more of your affairs. What are all these  marriages and no marriages, our neighbourhood is so busy in making and  unmaking?'  Camilla returned the most brief and quiet answers in her power; but was too  late to save the delicacy of Eugenia in concealing her late double  disappointments, the abortive preparations of Sir Hugh having travelled through  all the adjoining country. 'Poor little dear ugly thing!' cried Mrs. Arlbery,  'she must certainly go off with her footman;—unless, indeed, that good old  pedant, who teaches her that vast quantity of stuff she will have to unlearn,  when once she goes a little about, will take compassion upon her and her  thousands, and put them both into his own pockets.'  This raillery was painful nearly to disgust to Camilla; who frankly declared  she saw her sister with no eyes but those of respect and affection, and could  not endure to hear her mentioned in so ridiculous a manner.  'Never judge the heart of a wit,' answered she, laughing, 'by the tongue! We  have often as good hearts, ay, and as much good nature, too, as the careful  prosers who utter nothing but what is right, or the heavy thinkers who have too  little fancy to say anything that is wrong. But we have a pleasure in our own  rattle that cruelly runs away with our discretion.'  She then more seriously apologized for what she had said, and declared herself  an unaffected admirer of all she had heard of the good qualities of Eugenia.  Other subjects were then taken up, till they were interrupted by a visit from  the young bride, Mrs. Lissin.  Jumping into the room, 'I'm just run away,' she cried, 'without saying a word  to any body! I ordered my coach myself, and told my own footman to whisper me  when it came, that I might get off, without saying a word of the matter. Dear!  how they'll all stare when they miss me! I hope they'll be frightened!'  'And why so, you little chit? why do you want to make them uneasy?'  'O! I don't mind! I'm so glad to have my own way, I don't care for anything  else. Dear, how do you do, Miss Camilla Tyrold? I wonder you have not been to  see me! I had a great mind to have invited you to have been one of my bride's  maids. But papa was so monstrous cross, he would not let me do hardly any thing  I liked. I was never so glad in my life as when I went out of the house to be  married! I'll never ask him about any one thing as long as I live again. I'll  always do just what I chuse.'  'And you are quite sure Mr. Lissin will never interfere with that resolution?'  'O, I sha'n't let him! I dare say he would else. That's one reason I came out  so, just now, on purpose to let him see I was my own mistress. And I told my  coachman, and my own footman, and my maid, all three, that if they said one  word, I'd turn 'em all away. For I intend always to turn 'em away when I don't  like 'em. I shall never say anything to Mr. Lissin first, for fear of his  meddling. I'm quite determined I won't be crossed any more, now I've servants  of my own. I'm sure I've been crossed long enough.'  Then, turning to Camilla, 'Dear,' she cried, 'how grave you look! Dear, I  wonder you don't marry too! When I ordered my coach, just now, I was ready to  cry for joy, to think of not having to ask papa about it. And to-day, at  breakfast, I dare say I rung twenty times, for one thing or another. As fast as  ever I could think of any thing, I went to ringing again. For when I was at  papa's, every time I rang the bell, he always asked me what I wanted. Only  think of keeping one under so!'  'And what in the world said Mr. Lissin to so prodigious an uproar?'  'O, he stared like any thing. But he could not say much: I intend to use him to  it from the first, that he may never plague me, like papa, with asking me  what's the reason for every thing. If I don't like the dinner to-day, I'll  order a new one, to be dressed for me on purpose. And Mr. Lissin, and papa, and  Mrs. Mittin, and the rest of 'em, may eat the old one. Papa never let me order  the dinner at home; he always would know what there was himself, and have what  he chose. I'm resolved I'll have every thing I like best, now, every day. I  could not get at the cook alone this morning, because so many of 'em were in  the way; though I rung for her a dozen times. But to-morrow, I'll tell her of  some things I intend to have the whole year through; in particular, currant  tarts, and minced veal, and mashed potatoes. I've been determined upon that  these three years, for against I was married.'  Then, taking Camilla by the hand, she begged she would accompany her to next  room, saying, 'Pray excuse me, Aunt Arlbery, because I want to talk to Miss  Tyrold about a secret.'  When they came to another apartment, after carefully shutting the door, 'Only  think,' she cried, 'Miss Camilla Tyrold, of my marrying Mr. Lissin at last!  Pray did you ever suspect it? I'm sure I did not. When papa told me of it, you  can't think how I was surprised. I always thought it would have been Colonel  Andover, or Mr. Macdersey, or else Mr. Summers; unless it had been Mr. Wiggan;  or else your brother; but Mr. Lissin never once came into my head, because of  his being so old. I dare say he's seven and twenty! only think!—But I believe  he and papa had settled it all along, only papa never told it me, till just  before hand. I don't like him much; do you?'  'I have not the pleasure to know him: but I hope you will endeavour to like him  better, now.'  'I don't much care whether I do or not, for I shall never mind him. I always  determined never to mind a husband. One minds one's papa because one can't help  it: But only think of my being married before you! though you're seventeen  years old—almost eighteen, I dare say—and I'm only just fifteen. I could  not help thinking of it all the time I was dressing for a bride. You can't  think how pretty my dress was. Papa made Mrs. Mittin buy it, because, he said,  she could get every thing so cheap: but I made her get it the dearest she  could, for all that. Papa's monstrous stingy.'  This secret conference was broken up by a violent ringing at the gate,  succeeded by the appearance of Mr. Lissin, who, without any ceremony, opened  the door of the chamber into which the ladies had retired.  'So, ma'am!' said he, visibly very angry, 'I have the pleasure at last to find  you! dinner has waited till it is spoilt, and I hope, therefore, now, you will  do us the favour to come and sit at the head of your table.'  She looked frightened, and he took her hand, which she had not courage to draw  back, though in a voice that spoke a sob near at hand, 'I'm sure,' she cried,  'this is not being treated like a married woman! and I'm sure if I'd known I  might not do as I like, and come out when I'd a mind, I would not have married  at all!'  Mr. Lissin, with little or no apology to Mrs. Arlbery, then conveyed his fair  bride to her coach.  'Poor simple girl!' exclaimed Mrs. Arlbery. 'Mr. Lissin, who is a country  squire of Northwick, will soon teach her another lesson, than that of ordering  her carriage just at dinner time! The poor child took it into her head that,  because, upon marrying, she might say, "my house," "my coach," and "my  servants," instead of "my papa's;" and ring her bell for [whom] she pleased,  and give her own orders, that she was to arrive at complete liberty and  independence, and that her husband had merely to give her his name, and lodge  in the same dwelling: and she will regard him soon, as a tyrant and a brute,  for not letting her play all day long the part of a wild school girl, just come  home for the holidays.'  The rest of the visit passed without further investigation on the part of Mrs.  Arlbery, or embarrassment on that of Camilla; who found again some little  pleasure in the conversation which, at first, had so much charmed, and the  kindness which even her apparent neglect had not extinguished.  Mrs. Arlbery, in two days, claimed her again. Mr. Tyrold would not permit her  to send an excuse, and she found that lady more kindly disposed to her than  ever; but with an undisguised compassion and concern in her countenance and  manner. She had now learnt that Edgar was gone abroad; and she had learnt that  Camilla had private debts, to the amount of one hundred and eighteen pounds.  The shock of Camilla, when spoken to upon this subject, was terrible. She soon  gathered, she had been betrayed by Mrs. Mittin, who, though she had made the  communication as a profound secret to Mrs. Arlbery, with whom she had met at  Mrs. Lissin's, there was every reason to suppose would whisper it, in the same  manner, to an hundred persons besides.  Mrs. Arlbery, seeing her just uneasiness, promised, in this particular, to  obviate it herself, by a conference with Mrs. Mittin, in which she would  represent, that her own ruin would be the consequence of divulging this affair,  from the general opinion which would prevail, that she had seduced a young lady  under age, to having dealings with a usurer.  Camilla, deeply colouring, accepted her kind offer; but was forced upon a  confession of the transaction; though with a shame for her trust in such a  character as Mrs. Mittin, that made her deem the relation a penance almost  adequate to its wrong.
