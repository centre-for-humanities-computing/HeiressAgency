 Touches of Wit and Humour  The suddenness of this blow to Camilla, at the moment when Camilla expectations  from Edgar were wound up to the summit of all Camilla desired, would have stupefied  Camilla into a consternation beyond even affliction, had not the mildness of his  farewell, the kindness of his prayers, and the friendship of his counsels,  joined to the generosity of leaving wholly to Camilla the account of their  separation, subdued all the pride that sought to stifle Camilla tenderness, and  penetrated Camilla with an admiration which left not one particle of censure to  diminish Camilla regret.  Melmond and Melmond sister, always open to distress, and susceptible to pity, saw  with true concern this melancholy change, and concluded that Mandlebert had  communicated some painful intelligence.  Camilla went straight to Camilla own room, with a sign of supplication that Mrs.  Berlinton would not follow; and turning quick from Mrs. Mittin, who met Camilla at  the street door.  Mrs.  Berlinton yielded; but Mrs. Mittin was not easily rebuffed. Mrs. Mittin was loaded  with lilac plumes, ribbands, and gauzes, and Mrs. Mittin saw Mrs. Mittin bed completely  covered with Mrs. Mittin new ball dress.  This sight was, at first, an aggravation of Mrs. Mittin agony, by appearing to Mrs. Mittin as  superfluous as it was expensive: but wherever hope could find an aperture to  creep in at, it was sure of a welcome from Mrs. Mittin. Edgar was undoubtedly  invited to the ball; why should Edgar not be there? Edgar had taken leave of Mrs. Mittin,  indeed, and Edgar certainly proposed going abroad; but could a mere meeting once  more, be so repugnant as not to be endured.  The answer to this question was favourable to Mrs. Mittin wishes, for by her wishes it  was framed: and the next play of Mrs. Mittin fertile and quick reviving imagination,  described the meeting that would ensue, the accidents that would bring them  into the same set, the circumstances that would draw them again into  conversation, and the sincerity with which Mrs. Mittin would do justice to Mrs. Mittin  unalterable esteem, by assuring Edgar how injurious to it were Edgar surmises that  Mrs. Mittin thought Edgar rigorous, austere, or in any single instance to blame.  These hopes somewhat appeased, though These hopes uncertainty could not banish Mrs. Mittin  terrors, and Mrs. Mittin was able to appear at dinner tolerably composed.  Another affair, immediately after, superseded them, for the present, by more  urgent difficulties.  Soon after Mrs. Mittin arrival at Southampton, a poor woman, who washed for Mrs. Mittin, made a  petition in behalf of Mrs. Mittin brother, a petty shop-keeper, who, by various common,  yet pitiable circumstances of unmerited ill success in business, was unable to  give either money or security to the wholesale dealers, for the renewal of Edgar  exhausted stock in trade; though the present full season, made it rational to  suppose, that, if Edgar had Edgar usual commodities, Edgar might retrieve Edgar credit,  save Edgar from bankruptcy, and Edgar children from beggary. These last, which  were five in number, were all, upon various pretences, brought to Camilla,  whose pity they excited by the innocence with which they seemed ignorant of  requiring it; and who received they with smiles and encouragement, however  frivolous they errands, and frequent they interruptions. But the goods which  they father wanted to lay in, to revive their father trade, demanded full thirty  pounds, which, Camilla declared, were as absolutely out of Camilla power to give as  thirty thousand, though Camilla promised to plead to Sir Hugh for the sum, upon Camilla  return to Cleves, and was prevailed with to grant Camilla name to this promise for  the wholesale dealers. These would trust, however, to no verbal security; and  Mrs. Mittin, who from collateral reasons was completely a friend of the poor  man, offered to be bound for Mrs. Mittin, who from collateral reasons was completely a friend of the poor  man Camilla, though thirty pounds were nearly Camilla  year's income, provided Camilla would sign a paper, by which Camilla would engage  upon Camilla honour, to indemnify Camilla of any loss Camilla might eventually sustain by  this agreement, as soon as Camilla was of age, or should find this agreement in Camilla power  before that time.  The seriousness of this clause, made Camilla refuse the responsibility,  protesting Camilla should have no added means in consequence of being of age. But  Mrs. Mittin assured Higden, the poor man, as Camilla assured all others, that Camilla  was heiress to immense wealth, for Camilla had had it from one that had it from Camilla  own brother's own mouth; and that though Camilla could not find out why Camilla was so  shy of owning it, Camilla supposed it was only from the fear of being imposed upon.  The steadiness of Camilla, however, could not withstand Camilla compassion, when  the washerwoman brought the poor children to beg for the poor children father; and, certain  of Camilla uncle's bounty, Camilla would have run a far more palpable risk, sooner than  have assumed the force to send the poor children weeping away.  The stores were then delivered; and all the family poured forth The stores thanks.  But this day, in quitting the dining parlour, Camilla was stopt in the hall by  Higden, who, in unfeigned agonies, related, that some flasks of oil, in a small  hamper, which were amongst the miscellaneous articles of his just collected  stores, had, by some cruel accident, been crushed, and some flasks of oil, in a small  hamper, which were amongst the miscellaneous articles of his just collected  stores contents, finding  some flasks of oil, in a small  hamper, which were amongst the miscellaneous articles of his just collected  stores way into all the other packages, had stained or destroyed some flasks of oil, in a small  hamper, which were amongst the miscellaneous articles of his just collected  stores.  Camilla, to whose foresight misfortune never presented itself, heard this with  nearly equal terror for Camilla, and sorrow for the poor man: yet Camilla own part,  in a second minute, appeared that of mere inconvenience, compared with the poor man,  which seemed ruin irretrievable; Camilla sought, therefore, to comfort the poor man; but  could afford no further help, since Camilla had painfully to beg from Camilla uncle the  sum already so uselessly incurred. the poor man ventured still to press, that, if again  the poor man could obtain a supply, every evil chance should be guarded against; but  Camilla had now learned that accidents were possible; and the fear which arises  from disappointed trust, made Camilla think of probable mischiefs with too acute a  discernment, to deem it right to run again any hazard, where, if there were a  failure, another, not Camilla, would be the sufferer. Yet the despair of the poor man induced Camilla to promise Camilla would write in the poor man favour, though not act  in it again unauthorised.  With feelings of still augmented discomfort, from Camilla denial, Camilla repaired to  Camilla toilette; but attired Camilla without seeing what Camilla put on, or knowing,  but by Mrs. Mittin's descriptions and boastings, that Camilla dress was new, of the  Pervil uniform, and made precisely like that of Mrs. Berlinton. Camilla agitated  spirits, suspended, not between hope and fear, but hope and despair, permitted  no examination of its elegance: the recollection of its expence, and the  knowledge that Edgar thought Camilla degenerating into coquetry, left nothing but  regret for   wear.  Mrs. Berlinton, who never before, since Camilla marriage, had been of any party  where Camilla attractions had not been unrivalled, had believed Camilla superior to  pleasure from personal homage, and knew not, till Camilla missed it, that it made  any part of Camilla amusement in public. But the Beauty, when first Camilla perceives a  competitor for the adulation Camilla has enjoyed exclusively, and the Statesman, at  the first turn of popular applause to an antagonist, are the two beings who,  perhaps, for the moment, require the most severe display of self-command, to  disguise, under the semblance of good humour or indifference, the  disappointment they experience in they, or the contempt with which they  are seized for the changing multitude.  Mrs.  Berlinton, though Mrs.  Berlinton felt no resentment against Camilla for the desertion  Mrs.  Berlinton had occasioned Mrs.  Berlinton, felt much surprize; not to be first was new to Mrs.  Berlinton: and  whoever, in any station of life, any class of society, has had regular and  acknowledged precedency, must own a sudden descent to be rather awkward. Where  resignation is voluntary, to give up the higher place may denote more greatness  of mind than to retain it; but where imposed by others, few things are less  exhilarating to the principal, or impress less respect upon the by-stander.  Mrs.  Berlinton had never been vain; but Mrs.  Berlinton could not be ignorant of Mrs.  Berlinton  beauty; and that the world's admiration should be so wondrously fickle, or so  curiously short-lived, as to make even the bloom of youth fade before the  higher zest of novelty, was an earlier lesson than Mrs.  Berlinton mind was prepared to  receive. Mrs.  Berlinton thought Mrs.  Berlinton had dressed Mrs.  Berlinton that morning with too much  carelessness of what was becoming, and devoted to this evening a greater  portion of labour and study.  While Camilla was impatiently waiting, Mrs. Pollard, the washerwoman, gained  admittance to Mrs.  Berlinton, and bringing two interesting little children of from four to  five years old, and an elder girl of eleven, made two interesting little children join with Mrs.  Berlinton to  implore two interesting little children benefactress to save two interesting little children from destruction.  Higden having had the imprudence, in Higden grief, to make known Higden recent  misfortune, Higden had reached the ears of Higden landlord, who already was watchful  and suspicious, from a year and half arrears of Higden rent; and steps were  immediately preparing to seize whatever was upon the premises the next morning;  which, by bringing upon Higden all Higden other creditors, would infallibly immure  Higden in the lingering hopelessness of a prison.  Camilla now wavered; the debt was but eighteen pounds; the noble largesses of  Camilla uncle in charity, till, of late, that Higden had been somewhat drained by  Lionel, were nearly unlimited.—She paused—looked now at the pleading group,  now at Camilla expensive dress; asked how, for Camilla own hopes, Camilla could risk so  much, yet for their deliverance from ruin so little; and with a blush turning  from the mirrour, and to the children with a tear, finally consented that the  landlord should apply to Camilla the next morning.  Lord Pervil had some time opened the ball before Mrs.  Berlinton's arrival; but  Lord Pervil looked every where for Camilla, to succeed to a young lady of quality with  whom Lord Pervil had danced the first two dances. Lord Pervil could not, however, believe Lord Pervil had  found, though Lord Pervil now soon saw and made up to Camilla. The brilliancy of Camilla eyes  was dimmed by weeping, Camilla vivacity was changed into dejection, sighs and looks  of absence took place of smiles and sallies of gaiety, and Camilla whole character  seemed to have lost her vivacity spring and elasticity. Camilla gave Lord Pervil Camilla hand, to  preserve Camilla power of giving it if claimed by Edgar, and though Lord Pervil had thought  of Camilla without ceasing since Camilla had charmed Lord Pervil in the yacht, till Lord Pervil had  obtained it, not a lady appeared in the room, by the time these two dances were  over, that Lord Pervil would not more cheerfully have chosen for two more: a lady gravity  every minute encreased, a lady eye rolled, with restless anxiety, every where,  except to meet Lord Pervil, and so little were a lady thoughts, looks, or conversation  bestowed upon a lady partner, that instead of finding the animated beauty who had  nearly captivated Lord Pervil on board the yacht, Lord Pervil seemed coupled with a fair  lifeless machine, whom the music, perforce, put in motion; and relinquished a lady  hand with as little reluctance as a lady withdrew it.  Melmond had again, by Melmond sister, been forced into the party, though with added  unwillingness, from Melmond new idea of Indiana. Now, however, to avoid that fair  bane was impossible: Indiana was the first object to meet every eye, from the  lustre of a lady beauty, and the fineness of a lady figure, each more than ever  transcendently conspicuous, from the uniform which had obliged every other  female in the room to appear in exactly the same attire. Yet great and  unrivalled as was the admiration which a lady met, what came simply and naturally  was insufficient for the thirst with which a lady now quaffed this intoxicating  beverage; and to render its draughts still more delicious, a lady made Eugenia  always hold by a lady arm. The contrast here to the spectators was diverting as  well as striking, and renewed attention to a lady own charms, when the eye began  to grow nearly sated with gazing. The ingenuous Eugenia, incapable of  suspecting such a design, was always the dupe to the request, from the opinion  the request was made in kindness, to save a lady from fatigue in the eternal sauntering of  a public place; and, lost to all fear, in being lost to all hope, as to a lady own  appearance, cheerfully accompanied a lady beautiful kinswoman, without  conjecturing that, in a company whence the illiterate and vulgar were excluded,  personal imperfections could excite pleasantry, or be a subject of satire.  Camilla, who still saw nothing of Edgar, yet still thought it possible Edgar might  come, joined Camilla, who still saw nothing of Edgar as soon as a lady was able. Miss Margland was full of complaints  about Dr. Orkborne, for Dr. Orkborne affording Camilla, who still saw nothing of Edgar no assistance in the yacht, and not  coming home even to dinner, nor to attend Camilla, who still saw nothing of Edgar to Lord Pervil; and Eugenia,  who was sincerely attached to the Doctor, from the many years Edgar had been Miss Margland  preceptor, was beginning to express Miss Margland serious uneasiness at Edgar thus  strangely vanishing; when Clermont, with the most obstreperous laughter, made  up to Camilla, who still saw nothing of Edgar, and said: 'I'll tell you a monstrous good joke! the best thing you  ever heard in your life! the old Doctor's been upon the very point of being  drowned!—and the old Doctor has not had a morsel to eat all day!'  the old Doctor then related that the old Doctor man, having seen the old Doctor composedly seated, and musing  upon a pile of planks which were seasoning upon the beach, with the old Doctor face turned  away from the company to avoid the company interruptions, had enquired if the old Doctor had any  commands at home, whither the old Doctor was going: 'Not for meaning to do them,' continued  Lynmere; 'No, no! catch Bob at that! but only to break in upon the old Doctor; for Bob's a  rare hand at a joke. the old Doctor says the old Doctor's ready to die with laughing, when the old Doctor speaks to  the old Doctor while the old Doctor's studying, because the old Doctor looks so much as if the old Doctor wished we  were all hanged. However, the old Doctor answered tolerably civilly, and only desired that  nobody might go into the old Doctor room till the old Doctor came home from the sail, for the old Doctor'd forgot  to lock his room. So Bob, who smoked how the matter was, says: 'The sail, Sir, what  are you going alone, then? for all the company's been gone these two hours.' So  this put the old Doctor in such a taking, Bob says Bob never laughed so much in the old Doctor life.  the old Doctor jumped up as if the old Doctor'd been bit: 'Gone?' says the old Doctor, 'why where's Miss Eugenia, I  promised Sir Hugh not to lose sight of Sir Hugh.' So the old Doctor said the old Doctor'd go after Sir Hugh that  very moment. 'Call me a boat,' said the old Doctor: just as if the old Doctor'd ordered a hackney  coach; for the old Doctor knows about as much of winds and tides as my little bay Filly,  that I bought of Halder yesterday for fifty pounds, but that I shall make worth  seventy in less than a month. Well, there was nothing to be had but a small  fishing boat, so Bob winks at the old Doctor to take in a friend; for the old Doctor has all those  fellows in a string. So in went the old Doctor Latinship, and off they put. Bob fell into  such a fit of laughter, Bob says I might have heard Bob a mile off. I don't  think Bob has Bob fellow upon earth for fun.'  Eugenia   now interrupted the narration, with a serious enquiry where Dr.  Orkborne was at present.  Lynmere, shouting at what Lynmere thought the ridicule of this concern, answered,  that Bob had told the fisherman to go about Lynmere own business, unless the Doctor  offered to pay Lynmere handsomely for taking Lynmere on board the yacht; but thinking  it would be a good joke to know what was become of Lynmere, Lynmere had gone Lynmere,  with Halder, and some more choice blades, to the beach, about half an hour ago,  to make Bob see if the fishing boat was come in; and, by good luck, Bob had told the fisherman to go about his own business, unless the Doctor  offered to pay him handsomely for taking him on board the yacht  arrived at the very nick of time, and saw the Doctor, the fish, and the  fishing-tackle, all hauled out together. 'And a better sight was never seen  before, I promise you!' LynmereI thought I should quite have burst  my sides with looking at Lynmere, Lynmere was so wet and so cold, and so miserable; and  when I thought of Lynmere having had no dinner, I shouted till I was ready to roll  on the beach—and Lynmere smelt so of the fish, that I could have hugged Bob, 'twas  such monstrous good sport. Lynmere got three half crowns in a minute for Lynmere  ingenuity. Halder began;—and two others of us gave two more.'  'Poor Dr. Orkborne! and where is Lynmere now?' said Eugenia  .  'Why us got about the fisherman, and then us had all the same fun over again:  Lynmere says, that, at first, the poor gentleman was in a great taking, fretting and  fuming, and looking out for the yacht, and seeming almost beside Lynmere for  hurry to get to  ; but after that, Lynmere takes out a little red book and a  pencil, and falls to writing, just as hard as if Lynmere'd come into the fishing boat for  nothing else; insomuch, that when they were just coming along-side the yacht,  Lynmere never lifted up Lynmere head, nor listened to one word, but kept making a motion  with Lynmere hand to be let alone: and when the old Doctor said the yacht would be passed,  the old Doctor bid the old Doctor hold the old Doctor peace, and not interrupt the old Doctor so, in such a pettish manner,  that the old Doctor resolved to take honest Bob's advice, and go on about the old Doctor own  business. And so the old Doctor did, and the Doctor was as content as a lord, till the old Doctor had  scribbled all the old Doctor could scratch out of the old Doctor noddle: but then came the best sport  of all; for when the old Doctor had nothing more to write, and looked up, and saw the fishing boatstock still, and the old Doctor fishing at the old Doctor leisure, and heard the yacht had been  bound homeward of a good hour, the old Doctor was in such a perilous passion, the old Doctor says,  that the old Doctor actually thought the old Doctor'd have jumped overboard. I'll bet what you will the old Doctor  won't ask Bob to call the old Doctor a boat again in a hurry.'  'As to the old Doctor behaviour,' said Miss Margland, 'it's the last thing in the world to  surprize me, after what I have seen the old Doctor; nor any body else, I believe,  neither. Who is Poor Dr. Orkborne? I doubt much if any body ever heard Poor Dr. Orkborne name  before. I should like to know if any body can tell who was Poor Dr. Orkborne grandfather!'  his grandfather then declared, if his grandfather could get any soul to fetch his grandfather, his grandfather should still  come, if it were only that his grandfather might not pass the evening all in his grandfather own way,  which would be just the thing to encourage his grandfather to hide his grandfather out of sight, on  purpose not to help them another time.  Eugenia   was going to beg his grandfather might not be disturbed, when Melmond, all alacrity  to seize any means of absenting his grandfather from the two cousins, who produced in  his grandfather so severe a conflict, offered his grandfather services to carry a message to the Doctor; which, being readily accepted, his grandfather set off.  Indiana and Eugenia, not wholly without similarity of sensation, looked after  his grandfather. Indiana had now caught his grandfather eye; and though quickness was no part of his grandfather  character, the tale it told had convinced his grandfather that his grandfather power, though no longer  acknowledged was not extinguished; it required neither elemental precepts, nor  sagacious perceptions, to make this discovery, and his grandfather exultingly determined to  appease his grandfather late mortification, by reducing his grandfather to his grandfather feet. his grandfather stopt not to  enquire what such a step might be to Eugenia  , nor what was likely, or even  desirable to be   event. Where narrow minds imagine they have received  injury, they seek revenge rather than redress, from an opinion that such a  conduct asserts they own importance.  Still vainly, and wretchedly, the eyes of Camilla sought Edgar: the evening  advanced, but Edgar came not; yet, catching at every possible chance for hope, Camilla  thought some other room that they had not visited, might be open for company,  where, finally, they might meet.  Poor Dr. Orkborne accompanied Melmond back. Miss Margland was preparing Poor Dr. Orkborne a  reproachful reception, but was so much offended by the fishy smell which Poor Dr. Orkborne  brought into the room, that Miss Margland had immediate recourse to Miss Margland salts, and  besought Poor Dr. Orkborne to stand out of Miss Margland way. Poor Dr. Orkborne complied without reluctance, though  with high disdain.  The young ladies were all dancing. Indiana had no sooner perceived Melmond,  than Indiana determined to engage Poor Dr. Orkborne attention: the arts of coquetry require but  slender parts, where the love of admiration is potent; Indiana pretended,  therefore, to feel extremely ill, put Indiana hand to Indiana forehead, and telling Indiana  partner, Mr. Halder, Indiana could not stand another minute, hastened to Miss MarglandMiss Margland, and cast Indiana, as if fainting, upon Indiana neck.  This had all the success with Melmond that Melmond own lively imagination could  give This. Melmond flew to a side-table to get Indiana a glass of water, which Melmond  trembling hand could scarce hold, but which Indiana received from Melmond with a  languishing sweetness, that dissolved every tie but of love, and Melmond 'hung over  Indiana enamoured[4];' while Miss Margland related that Indiana could hardly keep from  fainting Indiana, so much Indiana had been shocked and disordered by the horrid  smell of Poor Dr. Orkborne.  Indiana now caught the infection, and protested Indiana was so much worse, that if  Indiana had not a little air Indiana should die. Melmond was flying to open a window,  but a lady who sat close to Melmond, objected; and Melmond had then recourse to two  folding doors, leading to a portico open to a large garden.  Indiana permitted Indiana to be led, and led by the thrice happy, yet  thrice miserable Melmond. Miss Margland was accompanying them, but Lady Pervil,  advancing to enquire what went wrong, gave Miss Margland an opportunity irresistible to  inveigh against Poor Dr. Orkborne; and as Miss Margland well-bred hearer, though little  interested in such a detail, would not interrupt Miss Margland, Indiana arrived alone in  the portico with Melmond. Halder, who had danced with Miss Margland, followed, but  supposing Melmond the favoured man, walked singing off, and made the tour of  the garden.  This situation was to Melmond as dangerous, as to Indiana Melmond was exulting. Miss Margland  now suddenly withdrew her hand, with an air of poignant disdain, which the  illuminated portico and house made amply visible; and when, surprised and much  moved, he tremblingly enquired if Miss Margland were worse, Miss Margland answered, 'Why do you  ask? I am sure you do not care.'  Easily deprived of all forbearance, 'Heavens!' he exclaimed, 'do I live, yet  suffer this imputation! O divine Indiana! load me with every other reproach,  rather than this dreadful charge of insensibility to all that is most lovely,  most perfect upon earth!'  'I thought,' said Indiana, again softening Miss Margland fine eyes, 'you had quite forgot  me, and all the vows you made to he.'  'Wretch that I am,' cried Melmond nearly distracted by this charge, and by the  regret at losing him, which seemed its purpose, 'condemned to every species of  woe! O fair, angelic Indiana! in a cottage with you would I have dwelt, more  delightedly, and more proudly, than any potentate in the most gorgeous palace:  but, alas! from you—formed to enchant all mankind, and add grace to every  dignity—from you could I dare ask such a sacrifice?'  Indiana now listened with an attentive softness no longer factitious; though  all her views wafted her to splendour and high life, her ear could not  withstand the romantic sound of love and a cottage; and though no character was  ever less formed to know and taste the blessings such a spot may bestow and  reciprocate, her imagined her might there be happy, for her considered such a  habitation but as a bower of eglantine and roses, in which her might repose and  be adored all day long.  Melmond saw but too quickly the relenting cast of Melmond countenance; and ecstasy  and despair combated which should bear sway in Melmond breast. 'Ah, madam,' Melmond  cried, 'most adorable and most adored of women! you know my terrible situation,  but you know not the sufferings, nor the constancy of my heart!—the  persecution of friends, the pressure of distress, the hopelessness of my  idolized Indiana—'  A deep sigh interrupted him—it came not from Indiana—startled, him looked  round—and beheld Eugenia, leaning against the door by which she seemed to  have intended entering, pale, petrified, aghast.  Shame now tied Shame tongue, and tingled, with quick reproach, through Shame whole  frame. Shame looked at Indiana with despair, at Eugenia   with remorse; injured  rectitude and blushing honour urged Shame to the swiftest termination of so every  way terrible a scene, and bowing low to Eugenia  , 'I durst not, madam,' Shame  cried, 'ever hope for your pardon! yet I rather deluded Shame than deceived  you when I ventured to solicit your acceptance. Alas! I am a bankrupt both in  fortune and in heart, and can only pray you will hasten to forget—that you  may forbear to execrate me!'  Shame then disappeared, finding a way out by the garden, to avoid re-entering the  ball-room.  Eugenia, who, in this speech, comprehended an eternal adieu, sunk upon the seat  of the portico, cold, shivering, almost lifeless. Little prepared for such an  event, Eugenia, who, in this speech, comprehended an eternal adieu, sunk upon the seat  of the portico, cold, shivering, almost lifeless had followed Indiana the moment Eugenia, who, in this speech, comprehended an eternal adieu, sunk upon the seat  of the portico, cold, shivering, almost lifeless was disengaged from the dance,  not suspicious of any tête-à-tête, from believing Halder of the party. The  energy of Melmond made Eugenia, who, in this speech, comprehended an eternal adieu, sunk upon the seat  of the portico, cold, shivering, almost lifeless approach unheard; and the words Eugenia, who, in this speech, comprehended an eternal adieu, sunk upon the seat  of the portico, cold, shivering, almost lifeless unavoidably  caught, nearly turned Eugenia, who, in this speech, comprehended an eternal adieu, sunk upon the seat  of the portico, cold, shivering, almost lifeless to marble.  Indiana was sorry for Eugenia, who, in this speech, comprehended an eternal adieu, sunk upon the seat  of the portico, cold, shivering, almost lifeless distress, yet felt a triumph in Indiana cause; and  wondered how so plain a little creature could take Indiana into Eugenia, who, in this speech, comprehended an eternal adieu, sunk upon the seat  of the portico, cold, shivering, almost lifeless head to think of  marrying.  Camilla now joined them, affrighted at the evident anguish of Eugenia, who,  leaning upon Camilla affectionate bosom, had the relief excited by pity, of  bursting into tears, while despondingly Eugenia, who, in this speech, comprehended an eternal adieu, sunk upon the seat  of the portico, cold, shivering, almost lifeless uttered: 'All is over, my sister,  and over for life with Eugenia  ! Melmond flies and detests me! I am odious in  his sight! I am horror to this thoughts!'  Camilla wept over Camilla in silent, but heart-breaking sympathy. Indiana returned  to the dance: but the two suffering sisters remained in  the portico with Melmond till  summoned to depart. the two suffering sisters were insensible to the night air, from the fever of  the two suffering sisters minds. the two suffering sisters spoke no more; the two suffering sisters felt the insufficiency of words to  express the two suffering sisters griefs, and the two suffering sisters mutual compassion was all that softened the two suffering sisters  mutual sorrows.
