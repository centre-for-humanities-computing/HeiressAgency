 Strictures on Deformity  Camilla went on to Etherington in deep distress; every ray of hope was chaced  from her prospects, with a certainty more cruel, though less offensive, to her  feelings, than the crush given them by Miss Margland. He cares not for me! she  cried; he even destines me for another! He is the willing agent of the Major;  he would portion me, I suppose, for him, to accelerate the impossibility of  ever thinking of me! And I imagined he loved me!—what a dream!—what a  dream!—how has he deceived me!—or, alas! how have I deceived myself!  She rejoiced, however, that she had made so decided an answer with regard to  Major Cerwood, whom she could not doubt to be the person meant, and who,  presented in such a point of view, grew utterly odious to her.  The tale she had to relate to Mr. Tyrold, of the sufferings and sad resolution  of Eugenia, obviated all comment upon her own disturbance. He was wounded to  the heart by the recital. 'Alas!' he cried, 'your wise and excellent mother  always foresaw some mischief would ensue, from the extreme caution used to keep  this dear unfortunate child ignorant of her peculiar situation. This dreadful  shake might have been palliated, at least, if not spared, by the lessons of  fortitude that noble woman would have inculcated in her young and ductile mind.  But I could not resist the painful entreaties of my poor brother, who, thinking  himself the author of her calamities, believed he was responsible for saving  her from feeling them; and, imagining all the world as soft-hearted as himself,  concluded, that what her own family would not tell her, she could never hear  elsewhere. But who should leave any events to the caprices of chance, which the  precautions of foresight can determine?'  These reflections, and the thoughts of her sister, led at once and aided  Camilla to stifle her own unhappiness; and for three days following, she  devoted herself wholly to Eugenia.  On the morning of the fourth, instead of sending the carriage, Sir Hugh arrived  himself to fetch Camilla, and to tell his brother, he must come also, to give  comfort to Eugenia; for, though he had thought the worst was over, because she  appeared quiet in his presence, he had just surprised her in tears, by coming  upon her unawares. He had done all he could, he said, in vain; and nothing  remained but for Mr. Tyrold to try his hand himself: 'For it is but justice,'  he added, 'to Dr. Orkborne, to say she is wiser than all our poor heads put  together; so that there is no answering her for want of sense.' He then told  him to be sure to put one of his best sermons in his pocket to read to her.  Mr. Tyrold was extremely touched for his poor Eugenia, yet said he had half an  hour's business to transact in the neighbourhood, before he could go to Cleves.  Sir Hugh waited his time, and all three then proceeded together.  Eugenia received her Father with a deliberate coldness that shocked him. He saw  how profound was the impression made upon her mind, not merely of her personal  evils, but of what she conceived to be the misconduct of her friends.  After a little general discourse, in which she bore no share, he proposed  walking in the park; meaning there to take her aside, with less formality than  he could otherwise desire to speak with her alone.  The ladies and Sir Hugh immediately looked for their hats or gloves: but  Eugenia, saying she had a slight head-ache, walked away to her room.  'This, my dear brother,' cried Sir Hugh, sorrowfully following her with his  eyes, 'is the very thing I wanted you for; she says she'll never more stir out  of these doors as long as she's alive; which is a sad thing to say, considering  her young years; and nobody knowing how Clermont may approve it. However, it's  well I've had him brought up from the beginning to the classics, which I  rejoice at every day more and more, it being the only wise thing I ever did of  my own head; for as to talking Latin and Greek, which I suppose is what they  will chiefly be doing, there's no doubt but they may do it just as well in a  room as in the fields, or the streets.'  Mr. Tyrold, after a little consideration, followed her. He tapped at her door;  she asked, in a tone of displeasure, who was there?—'Your Father, my dear,'  he answered; and then, hastily opening it, she proposed returning with him down  stairs.  'No,' he said; 'I wish to converse with you alone. The opinion I have long  cherished of your heart and your understanding, I come now to put to the proof.'  Eugenia, certain of the subject to which he would lead, and feeling she could  not have more to hear than to say, gave him a chair, and composedly seated  herself next to him.  'My dear Eugenia,' said he, taking her passive hand, 'this is the moment that  more grievously than ever I lament the absence of your invaluable Mother. All I  have to offer to your consideration she could much better have laid before you;  and her dictates would have met with the attention they so completely deserve.'  'Was my Mother, then, Sir,' said she, reproachfully, 'unapprized of the worldly  darkness in which I have been brought up? Is she unacquainted that a little  knowledge of books and languages is what alone I have been taught?'  'We are all but too apt,' answered Mr. Tyrold, mildly, though surprised, 'to  deem nothing worth attaining but what we have missed, nothing worth possessing  but what we are denied. How many are there, amongst the untaught and  unaccomplished, who would think an escape such as yours, of all intellectual  darkness, a compensation for every other evil!'  'They could think so only, Sir, while, like me, they lived immured always in  the same house, were seen always by the same people, and were total strangers  to the sensations they might excite in any others.'  'My dear Eugenia, grieved as I am at the present subject of your ruminations, I  rejoice to see in you a power of reflection, and of combination, so far above  your years. And it is a soothing idea to me to dwell upon the ultimate  benevolence of Providence, even in circumstances the most afflicting: for if  chance has been unkind to you, Nature seems, with fostering foresight, to have  endowed you with precisely those powers that may best set aside her malignity.'  'I see, Sir,' cried she, a little moved, 'the kindness of your intention; but  pardon me if I anticipate to you its ill success. I have thought too much upon  my situation and my destiny to admit any fallacious comfort. Can you, indeed,  when once her eyes are opened, can you expect to reconcile to existence a poor  young creature who sees herself an object of derision and disgust? Who, without  committing any crime, without offending any human being, finds she cannot  appear but to be pointed at, scoffed and insulted!'  'O my child! with what a picture do you wound my heart, and tear your own peace  and happiness! Wretches who in such a light can view outward deficiencies  cannot merit a thought, are below even contempt, and ought not to be disdained,  but forgotten. Make a conquest, then, my Eugenia, of yourself; be as superior  in your feelings as in your understanding, and remember what Addison admirably  says in one of the Spectators: 'A too acute sensibility of personal defects, is  one of the greatest weaknesses of self-love.'  'I should be sorry, Sir, you should attribute to vanity what I now suffer. No!  it is simply the effect of never hearing, never knowing, that so severe a call  was to be made upon my fortitude, and therefore never arming myself to sustain  it.'  Then, suddenly, and with great emotion clasping her hands: 'O if ever I have a  family of my own,' she cried, 'my first care shall be to tell my daughters of  all their infirmities! They shall be familiar, from their childhood, to their  every defect—Ah! they must be odious indeed if they resemble their poor  mother!'  'My dearest Eugenia! let them but resemble you mentally, and there is no  person, whose approbation is worth deserving, that will not love and respect  them. Good and evil are much more equally divided in this world than you are  yet aware: none possess the first without alloy, nor the second without  palliation. Indiana, for example, now in the full bloom of all that beauty can  bestow, tell me, and ask yourself strictly, would you change with Indiana?'  'With Indiana?' she exclaimed; 'O! I would forfeit every other good to change  with Indiana! Indiana, who never appears but to be admired, who never speaks  but to be applauded.'  'Yet a little, yet a moment, question, and understand yourself before you  settle you would change with her. Look forward, and look inward. Look forward,  that you may view the short life of admiration and applause for such  attractions from others, and their inutility to their possessor in every moment  of solitude or repose; and look inward, that you may learn to value your own  peculiar riches, for times of retirement, and for days of infirmity and age!'  'Indeed, Sir,—and pray believe me, I do not mean to repine I have not the  beauty of Indiana; I know and have always heard her loveliness is beyond all  comparison. I have no more, therefore, thought of envying it, than of envying  the brightness of the sun. I knew, too, I bore no competition with my sisters;  but I never dreamt of competition. I knew I was not handsome, but I supposed  many people besides not handsome, and that I should pass with the rest; and I  concluded the world to be full of people who had been sufferers as well as  myself, by disease or accident. These have been occasionally my passing  thoughts; but the subject never seized my mind; I never reflected upon it at  all, till abuse, without provocation, all at once opened my eyes, and shewed me  to myself! Bear with me, then, my father, in this first dawn of terrible  conviction! Many have been unfortunate,—but none unfortunate like me! Many  have met with evils—but who with an accumulation like mine!'  Mr. Tyrold, extremely affected, embraced her with the utmost tenderness: 'My  dear, deserving, excellent child,' he cried, 'what would I not endure, what  sacrifice not make, to soothe this cruel disturbance, till time and your own  understanding can exert their powers?' Then, while straining her to his breast  with the fondest parental commiseration, the tears, with which his eyes were  overflowing, bedewed her cheeks.  Eugenia felt them, and, sinking to the ground, pressed his knees. 'O my  father,' she cried, 'a tear from your revered eyes afflicts me more than all  else! Let me not draw forth another, lest I should become not only unhappy, but  guilty. Dry them up, my dearest father—let me kiss them away.'  'Tell me, then, my poor girl, you will struggle against this ineffectual  sorrow! Tell me you will assert that fortitude which only waits for your  exertion; and tell me you will forgive the misjudging compassion which feared  to impress you earlier with pain!'  'I will do all, every thing you desire! my injustice is subdued! my complaints  shall be hushed! you have conquered me, my beloved father! Your indulgence,  your lenity shall take place of every hardship, and leave me nothing but filial  affection!'  Seizing this grateful moment, he then required of her to relinquish her  melancholy scheme of seclusion from the world: 'The shyness and the fears which  gave birth to it,' said he, 'will but grow upon you if listened to; and they  are not worthy the courage I would instil into your bosom—the courage, my  Eugenia, of virtue—the courage to pass by, as if unheard, the insolence of  the hard-hearted, and ignorance of the vulgar. Happiness is in your power,  though beauty is not; and on that to set too high a value would be pardonable  only in a weak and frivolous mind; since, whatever is the involuntary  admiration with which it meets, every estimable quality and accomplishment is  attainable without it: and though, which I cannot deny, its immediate influence  is universal, yet in every competition and in every decision of esteem, the  superior, the elegant, the better part of mankind give their suffrages to merit  alone. And you, in particular, will find yourself, through life, rather the  more than the less valued, by every mind capable of justice and compassion, for  misfortunes which no guilt has incurred.'  Observing her now to be softened, though not absolutely consoled, he rang the  bell, and begged the servant, who answered it, to request his brother would  order the coach immediately, as he was obliged to return home; 'And you, my  love,' said he, 'shall accompany me; it will be the least exertion you can make  in first breaking through your averseness to quit the house.'  Eugenia would not resist; but her compliance was evidently repugnant to her  inclination; and in going to the glass to put on her hat, she turned aside from  it in shuddering, and hid her face with both her hands.  'My dearest child,' cried Mr. Tyrold, wrapping her again in his arms, 'this  strong susceptibility will soon wear away; but you cannot be too speedy nor too  firm in resisting it. The omission of what never was in our power cannot cause  remorse, and the bewailing what never can become in our power cannot afford  comfort. Imagine but what would have been the fate of Indiana, had your  situations been reversed, and had she, who can never acquire your capacity, and  therefore never attain your knowledge, lost that beauty which is her all; but  which to you, even if retained, could have been but a secondary gift. How short  will be the reign of that all! how useless in sickness! how unavailing in  solitude! how inadequate to long life! how forgotten, or repiningly remembered  in old age! You will live to feel pity for all you now covet and admire; to  grow sensible to a lot more lastingly happy in your own acquirements and  powers; and to exclaim, with contrition and wonder, Time was when I would have  changed with the poor mind-dependent Indiana!'  The carriage was now announced; Eugenia, with reluctant steps, descended;  Camilla was called to join them, and Sir Hugh saw them set off with the utmost  delight.
