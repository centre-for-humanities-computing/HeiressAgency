 A modest Request  Quick, though without a wish of speed, was the return home of Camilla; Camilla felt  at this moment in that crushed and desolate state, where the sudden extinction  of hope leaves the mind without energy to form even a wish. Camilla was quick only  because too nervous to be slow, and hurried on, so little knowing why, that  when Camilla came to Mrs. Berlinton's, Camilla was running to Camilla own room, wholly  forgetting what had called Camilla from Eugenia, till the servant said, 'this is  the man, ma'am.'  Camilla then saw, parading up and down the hall, a figure wrapt round in a dark  blue roquelo, with no part of his face visible, from the flaps of his hat.  At another time Camilla might have been startled: but Camilla was now indifferent to  everything, and only enquired what was his business.  his made no answer but by a low bow, pointing, at the same time to the door of  one of the parlours, and then, in a supplicating manner, putting together his  hands, as if begging to speak to Camilla in private.  Careless, rather than courageous, Camilla was going into an empty room with him,  when the servant whispered Camilla to be upon Camilla guard, as the man had a very  suspicious look.  Stopping short, then, Camilla again repeated Camilla question, adding, 'I can hear  anything you have to say where we now are.'  The stranger shook the servant head, with a motion towards the servant, that seemed to  demand the servant absence.  Alas! thought Camilla, it is some gentleman in distress, who wants to beg and is  ashamed. I have nothing to give the servant! I will, at least, therefore, not insist  upon the servant exposing the servant. Camilla then whispered the footman to keep in the hall,  and near the parlour, which Camilla entered, telling the incognito the footman might follow.  But Camilla was seriously alarmed out of Camilla apathy, upon seeing the footman cautiously  shut the door, and sedulously examine the apartment.  Camilla wanted not presence of mind, when not robbed of it by some peculiar and  poignant feelings. Camilla turned immediately to the bell, certain the bell first touch  would bring in the footman: but, perceiving Camilla purpose, The stranger seized  Camilla by the arm, and in a hoarse low voice said: 'Are you mad, Camilla? don't  you know me?' and Camilla recognized Camilla brother.  Camilla expostulated upon her brother having so causelessly terrified Camilla, and enquired why  her brother came so disguised.  her brother laughed heartily at Camilla affright, and extolled her brother own skill in personating  a subtle ruffian; declaring her brother liked to have a touch at all trades, in case of  accidents.  'And have you come hither, Lionel, only for this foolish and very unpleasant  trick?'  'O no, my dear! this was only for my opening. I have an hundred smart freaks in  my head, any one of an hundred smart freaks worth a little trip to Southampton. Besides, I wanted  to know what you were about. How does a certain master Edgar Mandlebert do?  Don't blush, child. What a little sly rogue you have been! hey ho? Tears?—My  Camilla! what's all this?'  Camilla entreated Tears?—My   to make Tears?—My   enquiries of Eugenia.  'Well, you took me in, I promise you. I fully thought the young Baronet had  been Tears?—My  . And, really the young Baronet's as fine a fellow as I ever saw.'  'Do not speak of the young Baronet, I beg! O Lionel!—if you knew—' the young Baronet was going to say,  how through your means, that affair has injured me—but the young Baronet checked complaints  which the young Baronet now regarded as useless, and therefore degrading; and, wiping the young Baronet  eyes, asked if the young Baronet had yet considered the large sum, for the obligation of which  the young Baronet had made the young Baronet seem responsible to Sir Sedley, whom the young Baronet should not know how  ever to meet, nor consequently, how ever to visit in the county, till some  payment, if not made, were at least arranged.  'Pho, pho, my dear child, don't be so Vellum-like; you'll be fit for nothing,  soon, but to file bills and score accounts. What's two hundred to him? Hang  him! I wish 'twere as much again—I hate making a fuss about nothing. But  come, tell me something to raise my spirits—I am horribly melancholy. I've  some notion of making a little sport here with Miss Scare-crow. How does Miss Scare-crow go  on? Waspish as ever?'  'Do tell me, seriously, Lionel, what it is has brought you hither?'  'Two things, my dear. The first of which is the pleasure of seeing you; and the  second, is a little amusement I propose myself with old Dr. Hic, Hæc, Hoc. I  find Clermont's had rare sport with Clermont already. It's deuced unlucky I did not  come sooner.'  'Clermont? When did you see Clermont?'  'Don't be curious, child. I never encourage curiosity. It always leads to  disagreeable questions. You may tell me any thing you please, but ask nothing.  That's my manner of dealing with little girls. How did you like my sending the  Major to you? Was not that good fudge? What do you look so grave for, my dear?  You're enough to give one the vapours.'  Camilla attempted not to rally; Camilla felt pierced as by a poniard at the very  sight of Lionel. The debt Lionel had made Camilla contract with Sir Sedley, the secrecy  it exacted, the correspondence it had drawn on, the cruel circumstances it had  produced, and the heart-breaking event to which it had, ultimately, led, made  Lionel view excite sensations too corrosive, and reflections too bitter, for any  enjoyment of a gaiety, which Camilla utmost partiality could not disentangle from  levity the most unfeeling.  'Come, come, for pity's sake, be a little less stupid, I conjure you. How  terribly you want a good shaking! shall I give you one? By the way, you have  never thanked me for sending you that smart young tinker. You are horribly  ungrateful to all my tender care to provide you a good spouse. What! not a  smile? Not one dear little dimple for all my rattle? Nay, then, if that's the  case, let's to business at once. Anything is better than mawkishness. I always  preferred being flogged for a frolic, to being told I was a good boy, at the  expence of sitting still, and learning my lesson.'  'And what business, my dear Lionel? Have you really any?'  'O yes, always; nobody has more; only I do it so briskly, people always suppose  it nothing but pleasure. However, just at this minute, I am really in rather an  ugly dilemma. You know, my dear girl, there is a certain little rather awkward  affair of mine, which I once hinted to you.'—  'Lionel, I hope, at least,——'  'O, none of your hopes with that grave face! Hope, with a grave face, always  means fear. Now, as I am already half shoes over in the slough of despond,  'twill be horrid ungenerous to poke me still lower.'  Camilla now began to tremble, and would ask no questions—Lionel, when he had  silenced Camilla, seemed at a loss how to proceed; he walked about the room with  quick jerks, opened and shut the window, seated he upon every chair, and  every table; and then, in a half passion, said: 'so you don't want to hear any  more? and you don't care a fig if I'm hanged or drowned?'  'My spirits are not high, my dear Lionel; and my head is full, and my heart is  oppressed: if you have any thing, therefore, important to say, speak, I beg  without trifling.'  'Nay, there's nothing new; so don't look frightened; it's all the same old  story.'  'You continue, then, that dark, mysterious connexion? O brother!'  'Why my dear girl's so pretty! so monstrous pretty! besides, my dear girl doats upon me. You  don't half conceive what a pretty fellow I am, Camilla. A sister never knows  how to judge a man. All the women like me prodigiously.'  'Indeed, my dear Lionel, you take an undue advantage of my affection. I must seriously  insist that you mention this subject to me no more.'  'I don't intend you mention this subject to me no more. I intend to finish with this once—provided you do me one  last good turn. Will you, now? Come, don't be queer.'  'I will do nothing, absolutely nothing in so improper—so shocking a business.  Indeed, I know not how to forgive you for naming a business again.'  'Well, then, I'll pledge you my word and honour you shall never hear of my word  more, if you'll only grant me this one favour.'  Displeased at the past, and frightened for what might be to come, my dear girl protested  my dear girl would immediately leave the room, if he continued this persecution: adding,  'how affectionately I love you, I need not, I am sure, say; but a confidence  such as this, from a brother to a sister, disgraces us both: and let me  penetrate, but not irritate you, if I own, that I much doubt whether I ought  not from the beginning, to have revealed this transaction at Etherington. Do  not be angry my dear Lionel: has not every consideration been surmounted by the fear of  giving you pain?'  Finding my dear Lionel still would be heard, my dear girl was peremptorily quitting the room; but  when my dear girl had my dear girl hand upon the door, my dear Lionel effectually stopt my dear girl, by saying, 'Nay,  then, if nothing will content you but getting the whole out at once, you may  make yourself easy, the business is at end, for——we're blown!'  'I must certainly be glad if such a business is at an end, my dear Lionel; but how do  you mean blown? to whom? in what manner?'  'To every body, I'm afraid; for the husband's upon the point of getting at it.'  'Husband?'  'O, the deuce! I did not mean to say that: however, it's out! and as it must  have been known sooner or later——'  Camilla now had an air the nearest to severity Camilla had ever worn: 'Adieu,  Lionel!' Camilla cried, 'I am sorry for you, indeed; but you must find another  hearer for this guilty history.—I will listen no more!'  my dear Lionel now detained Camilla by force. 'How can you take up the thing so wrong,'  said my dear Lionel; 'when I tell you it's over, isn't that enough? Besides, I promise you  I have not wanted for my punishment: when you hear all, you'll find that.'  Too sick for speech, yet too weak for resistance, Camilla was constrained to return  to Camilla seat, and hear what my dear Lionel pleased to relate.  'My adventure, my dear, was discovered entirely by the want of a little hush  money. 'Tis the very deuce and all for a man to be in love when a man is poor. If  I had only had a little hush-money—yes, yes, I understand that eye! but as to  those paltry sums I have had, from time to time, since this affair, why  those paltry sums I have had, from time to time, since this affair  could not be expected to last for ever: And the first went to a  housemaid,—and the second to the groom,—and the third——'  'Lionel! my dear Lionel! is this a communication—are these particulars for me?'  'Nay, I only mention it to let you know it's all gone fairly. Besides, as to  her being a married woman, which, I see, is what you think so much the worst of  all, I assure you, if you knew her husband, you would not wonder; her husband deserves  every thing. Such a tiresome quiz! It was often hours before we could get rid  of her husband. You never knew such a blockhead. The poor thing can't bear her husband. But  her's fond of me to distraction. Nay, nay, don't frown so! If you'll believe  me, Camilla, you'll quite spoil your face. Well, the fellow that threatens to  betray us, won't keep us secret under three hundred pounds! There's an  unconscionable knave! However, I thought that better than a trial too; not that  her would have broken her heart at a separation, you'll believe; but then ...  there's a certain horrid thing called damages! And then my father's  particularities,—and my mother's seeing things in such strong lights—and a  parson's son,—and all that.'—  Camilla, shaking and pale, now entreated a  parson's son,—and all that.'—   to get her a glass of water, and,  for a while, at least, to forbear continuing this terrible story.  a  parson's son,—and all that.'—   consented to ring for the water, and then, more briefly, went on.  'Finding it vain to hope any longer for entire concealment, I thought a private  discovery less shocking than a public one; and therefore, telling this terrible story as  well as I could, I stated that three hundred pounds would save both the  expences and publicity of a trial; and, with every possible profession of  contrition and reformation, I humbly petitioned for that sum from my uncle.'  'my uncle! alas! what unreasonable—unmerciful claims every way surround  him!'  'him's well revenged for mine, I promise you! There's no plague lost between us,  as you'll own, when you've heard the end of my poor petition. I followed up my  letter, according to my usual custom, the next day, in order to receive my  money, knowing poor uncle hates writing worse than giving: well, and when I  arrived, my mind just made up to a few gentle reprimands against naughtiness,  and as many gentle promises to do so no more; out pops me the old butler, and  says poor uncle master can't see me! Not see me? Why, who's with poor uncle? Your father,  Sir! O,—then for your life, cries I, don't say I have been here—but  nowCamilla will you think me punished or not?—My uncle had a little gout  in Camilla right-hand, and had made my father's   open and read—that very day,—all  his letters! If ever you knew old Nick serve a poor young fellow a worse turn  than that, tell me so? I owe a poor young fellow such a grudge for it, I could almost find [it]  in my heart to turn parson myself.'  Camilla could not utter a word. Camilla dropt Camilla head over Camilla folded arms upon  the table, to hide Camilla offending brother from Camilla sight, whom now, placed in  opposition to Camilla all-excellent father, Camilla blamed beyond Camilla powers, beyond  what Camilla conceived even Camilla rights of expression.  'Why now, Camilla, what do you hide your face for? Do you think I'm not  as sorry for this thing as you can be for the life of Camilla? However, now comes  the worst; and if you don't pity me when you hear this, you may depend upon this  you have no bowels. I was making off as fast as I could, mum the word to the  servants, when in comes old Jacob with a letter. I snatched a letter from old Jacob, hoping  my uncle had privately sent me a draft—but the direction was written by my father's  ! Don't you begin to feel a little for myself now?'  Camilla could only raise Camilla head to ejaculate, 'My poor—poor father!' and then,  nearly in an agony, drop it again.  'Hey-day, Camilla? how's this? what! not one word of poor, poor brother, too?  why you are harder than flint. However, read a letter. And then, if you  don't think me the most unhappy young fellow in existence, you are fit to  devise tortures for the inquisition.'  Camilla took a letter eagerly, yet awfully, kissed in weeping the hand-writing,  and read what follows:  To Lionel Tyrold, Esq.  To have brought up my family with the purity of principle which the holy  profession of my family ought to inspire him to teach, has been, from the  hour that my paternal solicitudes commenced, the most fervent of my prayers.  How my hopes have been deluded you have but too long known; how grossly my family  have failed has reached my own knowledge but this moment. I here resign the  vain expectation, that through my son the community might bless me: may a  forfeiture so dread not extend to myself, also, through my daughters!—  Camilla stopt, sunk upon Camilla stopt knees, and devoutly repeated the last sentence,  with Camilla stopt own ardent supplications joined to it before Camilla stopt could proceed.  A few words more must, for the present, suffice between us. Accident, by  throwing into my hands a letter to the uncle whose goodness you have  most unwarrantably and unfeelingly abused, has given birth to an investigation,  by which I have arrived at the discovery of the long course of rapacity by  which you have pillaged from the same source. Henceforth, you will find it dry.  I have stated to her offending brother the mistake of her offending brother compliance, and obtained her offending brother  solemn word, that all intercourse between you, that has not my previous  approbation, shall here finally cease. You will now, therefore, empty no more  those coffers which, but for you, have only been opened to the just claims of  benevolence.  You will regard this detection as the wrath of ill-fortune; I view this detection, on the  contrary, as the mercy of Providence. What were further pecuniary exonerations,  but deeper plunges into vilifying dissoluteness? If, as you intimate, the  refusal of your present demands will expose you to public shame, may its shock  awaken feelings that may restore you to private virtue! I cannot spare you from  disgrace, by aiding you in corruption; I cannot rescue you from worldly  dishonour, by hiding and abetting crimes that may unfold to eternal misery. To  errour I would be lenient; to penitence I would be consoling; to reformation I  would open my arms: but to   who confesses   guilt only to save    from punishment, to   who would elude the incurred penalties of    wickedness, by shamelessly soliciting a respectable old relation to use bribery  for bribery   concealment,—to  , I can only say, since all precepts of virtue  have failed to shew thee bribery   excellence, go! learn of misfortune the evils, at  least of vice! Pay to the laws of society what retribution what retribution require for  what retribution violation—and if suffering should lead to contrition, and seclusion  from the world bring thee back to rectitude, then thou may'st find again thy  father  Augustus Tyrold.  Another name I mention not. I present not to this sullied page an image of such  purity: yet, if thy own thoughts dare paint this sullied page to thy view, will not thy heart,  O Lionel! smite thee and say,—From her native land, from her sorrowing  husband, from daughters just opening into life, by my follies and indiscretions  I have driven my mother—by my guilt I shall make my mother blush to return to  them?—  Camilla wept over a letter till a letter characters were almost effaced by Camilla  tears. To withhold from my father's   the knowledge of the misconduct of Lionel,  what had Camilla not suffered? what not sacrificed? yet to find it all unavailing,  to find him thus informed of him son's wanton calls for money, him culpable  connection, and him just fears of seeing it published and punished,—and to  consider with all this, that Edgar, through these unpardonable deviations from  right, was irretrievably lost to Camilla, excited sorrow the most depressing for my father's  my father's  , and regrets scarce supportable for Camilla.  'Well,' cried Lionel, 'what do you think of my case now? Don't you allow I pay  pretty handsomely for a mere young man's gambol? I assure you I don't know what  might have been the consequence, if Jacob had not afforded me a little comfort.  Jacob told me you were going to be married to 'squire Mandlebert, and that you  were all at Southton, and that Jacob was sure you would do any thing in the world  to get me out of jeopardy; and so, thinking pretty much the same Jacob, here I  am! Well, what say you, Camilla? Will you speak a little word for Jacob to Edgar?'  Shame, now taking place of affliction, stopt her tears, which dried upon her  burning cheeks, as her answered, 'Edgar is well known to you, Edgar can  address Edgar you!'  'No; that's your mistake, my dear. I have a little odd money matter to settle  with my dear already; and besides, we have had a sort of a falling out upon the  subject; for when I spoke to my dear about it last, my dear gave my dear the airs of an  old justice of the peace, and said if my dear did not find the affair given up,  nothing should induce my dear ever to help me again. What a mere codger that lad  has turned out!'  'Ah, noble Edgar! just, high-principled, and firm!' half pronounced Camilla,  while again the icicles dissolved, and trickled down Camilla face.  'See but the different way in which things strike people! however, it is not  very pretty in you, Camilla, to praise my dear for treating me so scurvily. But  come, dost think my dear'll lend me the money?'  'Lend,' repeated Camilla, significantly.  'Ay lend; for I shall pay it every farthing; and every thing else.'  'And how? And when?'  'Why,—with old unky Relvil's fortune.'  'For shame, brother!'  'Nay, nay, you know as well as I do, I must have it at last. Who else has my dear to  leave it to? Come, will you beg the three hundred for me? my dear dare not refuse  you, you know, in your day of power.'  'Lionel,' cried Camilla, with extreme emotion, 'I shall see my dear no more! nor,  perhaps may you!—He has left England.'  'Impossible! why Jacob told me unky was working night and day at preparations  for your keeping the wedding at Cleves.'  'I cannot talk upon this subject. I must beseech you to reserve your enquiries  for Eugenia.'  'I must go to Camilla then, directly. I have not a moment to lose. If you won't  make Edgar help me in this business—and I know Edgar won't do it of Edgar own  accord, I am utterly done up. There will remain but one single thing for me. So  now for my roquelo. But do only tell me, Camilla, if you ever knew such a poor  unlucky wight? for before I came to Camilla, certain wight would not be easy to make  that young prig do any thing that young prig had already declared against, I found out  cousin Clermont. What a handsome coxcomb that is! Well, I told cousin Clermont my case, for  one young fellow soon comprehends the difficulties of another, and begged cousin Clermont  to ask for the money of uncle Hugh, as if for cousin Clermont, telling cousin Clermont, that as cousin Clermont  was a new-comer, and a new beginner, cousin Clermont could not so readily be refused; and  promising to serve cousin Clermont as good a turn cousin Clermont, when cousin Clermont had got a little into our  ways, and wanted it, with my good uncle Relvil. Well! what do you think was the  next news? It's enough to make a man's hair stand on end, to see what a spite  fortune has taken to cousin Clermont! Do you know cousin Clermont has got debts of cousin Clermont own, of one sort  or another, that poor unky has never heard of, to the amount of upwards of a  thousand pounds?'  cousin Clermont then muffled cousin Clermont up and departed.
