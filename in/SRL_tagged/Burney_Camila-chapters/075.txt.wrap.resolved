 The Triumph of Pride  The three sisters were retired, at night, to another council in the room of  Camilla, when Molly Mill, with a look of dismay, burst in upon The three sisters, bringing,  with the answer of Sir Sedley, news that Tommy Hodd, by an accident Sir Sedley could  not help, had rode the horse she had borrowed for Sir Sedley of the under-groom to  death.  dismay, now, spread equally to them all. What a tale would this misfortune  unfold to Sir Hugh, to Edgar, to the whole house! The debt of Lionel, the  correspondence with Sir Sedley, the expectations of the young baronet....  Camilla could not support The debt of Lionel, the  correspondence with Sir Sedley, the expectations of the young baronet....  ; Camilla sent for Jacob to own to Jacob the affair, and  beg Jacob assistance.  Jacob, though getting into bed, obeyed the call. Jacob was, however, so much  irritated at the loss of the horse, and the boldness of the under-groom, in  lending Jacob without leave, that, at first, Jacob would listen to no entreaties,  and protested that both the boy and Molly Mill should be complained of to Jacob  master. The eloquence, however, of Jacob three young mistresses, for so all the  nieces of Sir Hugh were called by the servants at Cleves, soon softened Jacob  ire; Jacob almost adored his  master, and was affectionately attached to the young  family. the young  family begged Jacob, therefore, to buy another horse, as like another horse as  possible, and to contrive not to employ another horse when Sir Hugh was in sight, till  the young  family were able to clear up the history to the young  family uncle themselves: this would  not be difficult, as the baronet rarely visited the baronet stables since the baronet fall,  from the melancholy with which the baronet was filled by the sight of the baronet horses.  There was to be a fair for cattle in the neighbourhood the next day, and Jacob  promised to ride over to see what bargain Jacob   could make for what bargain.  what bargain then inquired about what money would be necessary for the purchase.  The cost, Jacob   said, of poor Tom Jones was 40Â£.  Camilla held up Camilla hands, almost screaming. Eugenia, with more presence of  mind, said Eugenia, with more presence of  mind would see Jacob   again in the morning before Jacob   went, and then  told Molly Mill to wait for Molly Mill in Molly Mill own room.  'What can I now do?' cried Camilla; 'I would not add the history of this  dreadful expence to the sad tale I have already to relate to Edgar for the  universe! To begin my career by such a string of humiliations would be  insupportable. Already I owe five guineas to Mrs. Arlbery, which the tumult of  my mind since my return has prevented me from naming to my uncle; and I have  left debts at Tunbridge that will probably take up all my next quarter's  allowance!'  'As far as these three guineas will go,' said Lavinia, taking out Lavinia purse,  'here, Camilla, these three guineas are; ... but how little that is! I never before  thought my pittance too small! yet how well we all know my dear father cannot  augment it.'  Eugenia, who, in haste, had stept to Lavinia , now came back, and putting  twenty guineas into the hand of Camilla, said: 'This, my beloved sister, is all  I now have by Camilla; but Jacob is rich and good, and will rejoice to pay the rest  for us at present; and I shall very soon reimburse Jacob, for my uncle has  insisted upon making me a very considerable present, which I shall, now, no  longer refuse.'  Camilla burst into tears, and, hanging about their necks: 'O my sisters,' Camilla  cried, 'what goodness is she  ! but how can I avail Camilla of it with any  justice? Your three guineas, my Lavinia, your little all ... how can I bear to  take?'  'Do not teach me to repine, Camilla, that I have no more! I am sure of  being remembered by my uncle on the approaching occasions, and I can never,  therefore, better spare my little store.'  'You are all kindness! and you my dear Eugenia, though you have more, have  claims upon that more, and are both expected and used to answer both....'  'Yes, I have indeed more!' interrupted Eugenia, 'which only sisters good as  mine could pardon; but because my uncle has made me my uncle heiress, has my uncle made me  a brute? No! whatever I have, must be amongst us all in common, not only now,  but ...' She stopt, affrighted at the idea she was presenting to she, and  fervently clasping she hands, exclaimed: 'O long ... long may it be ere I can  shew my sisters all I feel for them! them will believe it, I am sure ... and  that is far happier!'  The idea this raised struck them all, at the same moment, to the heart. Not one  of them had dry eyes, and with a sadness over-powering every other  consideration, them sighed as heavily, and with looks as disconsolate, as if  the uncle so dear to them were already no more.  The influence of parts, the predominance of knowledge, the honour of learning,  the captivation of talents, and even the charm of fame itself, all shrink in  The influence of parts, the predominance of knowledge, the honour of learning,  the captivation of talents, and even the charm of fame itself effects before the superior force of goodness, even where most simple and  uncultivated, for power over the social affections.  At an early hour, the next morning the commission, with the twenty guineas in  hand, and the promise of the rest in a short time, were given to Jacob; and  Camilla, then, begged permission of Camilla father, and the carriage of Camilla uncle,  to visit Mrs. Arlbery, who, Camilla had heard, was just returned to the Grove.  Concluding Camilla wished to be the messenger of Camilla own affairs to that lady, they  made no opposition, and that lady set off before eight o'clock, without entering the  parlour, where Edgar, Camilla was informed, was already arrived for breakfast.  The little journey was terrible to Camilla; scenes of disappointment and despair on  the part of Sir Sedley, were anticipated by Camilla alarmed imagination, and Camilla  reproached Camilla for every word Camilla had ever spoken, every look Camilla had ever  given, that could have raised any presumption of Camilla regard.  The last note was written in the style of all the others, and not one ever  expressed the smallest doubt of success; how dreadful then to break to him such  news, at the very moment him might imagine Camilla came to meet him with partial  pleasure!  Mrs. Arlbery was not yet risen. Camilla inquired, stammering, if any company  were at the house. None, was the answer. Camilla then begged leave to walk in the  garden till Mrs. Arlbery came down stairs.  Camilla was not sorry to miss Camilla; Camilla dreaded Camilla yet more than Sir SedleySir Sedley, and hoped to see Sir Sedley alone.  Nevertheless, Camilla remained a full hour in waiting, ruminating upon the wonder  Camilla disappearance would give to Edgar, and nearly persuaded some chance had  anticipated Camilla account to Sir Sedley, whose rage and grief were too violent to  suffer Edgar to keep Edgar appointment.  This idea served but to add to her perturbation, when, at last, her saw Edgar  enter the  garden.  All presence of mind then forsook her; her looked around to see if her could  escape, but Edgar approach was too quick for avoidance. her eyes, unable to  encounter Edgar, were bent upon the ground, and her stood still, and even  trembling, till Edgar reached her.  To the prepossessed notions and vain character of Sir Sedley, these were  symptoms by no means discouraging; with a confidence almost amounting to  arrogance Edgar advanced, pitying her distress, yet pitying Edgar still more for  the snare in which it was involving Edgar. Edgar permitted Edgar eyes for a moment to  fasten upon her, to admire her, and to enjoy triumphantly her confusion in  silence: 'Ah, beauteous tyrant!' Edgar then cried; 'if this instant were less  inappreciable, in what language could I upbraid thy unexampled abuse of power?  thy lacerating barbarity?'  Edgar then, almost by force, took her hand; her struggled eagerly to recover her hand,  but 'No,' Edgar cried, 'fair torturer! it is now my prisoner, and must be punished  for it inhuman sins, in the congealing and unmerciful lines it has portrayed  for Edgar.'  And then, regardless of her resistance, which he attributed to mere  bashfulness, he obstinately and incessantly devoured it with kisses, in  defiance of opposition, supplication, or anger, till, suddenly and piercingly,  her startled he with a scream, and snatched it away with a force irresistible.  Amazed, he stared at her. her face was almost convulsed with emotion; but Her faceeyes, which appeared to be fixed, directed he to the cause. At the bottom of  the walk, which was only a few yards distant, stood Mandlebert.  Pale and motionless, he looked as if bereft of strength and faculties. Camillahad seen he the moment Camilla raised Camilla eyes, and Camilla horror was uncontrollable.  Sir Sedley, astonished at what he beheld, astonished what to think, drew back,  with a supercilious kind of bow. Edgar, recalled by what Edgar thought insolence  to Edgar recollection, advanced a few steps, and addressing Edgar to Camilla,  said: 'I had the commands of Sir Hugh to pursue you, Miss Tyrold, to give you  immediate notice that Mr. Lynmere is arrived.' Mr. Lynmere added no more, deigned not a  look at Sir Sedley, but rapidly retreated, remounted Mr. Lynmere horse, and galloped  off.  Camilla looked after Sir Sedley till Mr. Lynmere was out of sight, with uplifted hands and  eyes, deploring Sir Sedley departure, Sir Sedley mistake, and Sir Sedley resentment, without courage  to attempt stopping Sir Sedley.  Sir Sedley stood suspended, how to act, what to judge. If Edgar's was the  displeasure of a discarded lover, why should Edgar's was the  displeasure of a discarded lover so affect Camilla? if of a  successful one, why came Camilla to meet Sir Sedley? why had Camilla received and answered Sir Sedley  notes?  Finding Camilla attempted neither to speak nor move, Sir Sedley again approached Camilla, and  saying, 'Fair Incomprehensible!...' would again have taken Camilla hand; but  rousing to a sense of Camilla situation, Camilla drew back, and with some dignity, but  more agitation, cried: 'Sir Sedley, I blush if I am culpable of any part of  your mistake; but suffer me now to be explicit, and let me be fully, finally,  and not too late understood. You must write to Sir Sedley no more; I cannot answer nor  read your letters. You must speak to Sir Sedley no more, except in public society; you  must go further, Sir Sedley ... you must think of Sir Sedley no more.'  'Horrible!' cried Sir Sedley, starting back; 'you distress me past measure!'  'No, no, you will soon ... easily ... readily forget me.'  'Inhuman! you make me unhappy past thought!'  'Indeed I am inexpressibly concerned; but the whole affair....'  'You shock, you annihilate me, you injure me in the tenderest point!'  Camilla now, amazed, cried 'what is it you mean, Sir Sedley?'  'By investing me, fair barbarian, with the temerity of forming any claim that  can call for repulse!'  Utterly confounded by so unexpected a disclaiming of all design, Camilla again,  though from far different sensations, cast up Camilla eyes and hands. And is it,  Camilla thought, for a trifler such as this, so unmeaning, so unfeeling, I have  risked my whole of hope and happiness?  Camilla said, however, no more; for what more could be said? Camilla coloured, past  him, and hastily quitting the  garden, told the footman to apologise to Mrs. Arlbery for Camilla sudden departure, by informing Camilla that a near relation was  just arrived from abroad; and then got into the carriage and drove back to  Cleves. Sir Sedley followed carelessly, yet without aiming at overtaking Sir Sedley,  and intreated, negligently, to be heard, yet said nothing which required the  smallest answer.  Piqued completely, and mortified to the quick, by the conviction which now  broke in upon Sir Sedley of the superior ascendance of Mandlebert, Sir Sedley could not brook  to have been thought in earnest when Sir Sedley saw Sir Sedley should not have been accepted,  nor pardon Sir Sedley own vanity the affront his own vanity had brought upon Sir Sedley pride. Sir Sedley sung  aloud an opera air till the carriage of Sir Hugh was out of sight, and then  drove Sir Sedley phaeton to Clarendel-Place, where Sir Sedley instantly ordered Sir Sedley  post-chaise, and in less than an hour, set off on a tour to the Hebrides.
