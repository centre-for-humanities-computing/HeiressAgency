 Offs and Ons  Mr. Tyrold left Eugenia to her sisters, unwilling to speak of Lynmere till he  had seen something more of him. Sir Hugh, also, was going, for he had no time,  he said, to lose in his preparations: but Eugenia, taking his arm, besought  that nothing of that kind might, at present, be mentioned.  'Don't trouble yourself about that, my dear,' he answered; 'for it's what I  take all into my own hands; your cousin being a person that don't talk much; by  which, how can any thing be brought forward, if nobody interferes? A girl, you  know, my dear, can't speak for herself, let her wish it never so much.'  'Alas!' said Eugenia, when he was gone, 'how painfully am I situated! Clermont  will surely suppose this precipitance all mine; and already, possibly,  concludes it is upon my suggestion he has thus prematurely been called from his  travels, and impeded in his praise-worthy ambition of studying the laws,  manners, and customs of the different nations of Europe!'  The wan countenance of Camilla soon, however, drew all observation upon  herself, and obliged her to narrate the cruel adventure of the morning.  The sisters were both petrified by the account of Sir Sedley; and their  compassion for his expected despair was changed into disgust at his insulting  impertinence. They were of opinion that his bird and his letters should  immediately be returned; and their horror of any debt with a character mingling  such presumption with such levity, made Eugenia promise that, as soon as she  was mistress of so much money, she would send him, in the name of Lionel, his  two hundred pounds.  The bird, therefore, by Tom Hodd, was instantly conveyed to Clarendel-Place;  but the letters Camilla retained, till she could first shew them to Edgar, ...  if this event had not lost him to her for ever, and if he manifested any desire  of an explanation.  Edgar himself, meanwhile, in a paroxysm of sudden misery, and torturing  jealousy, had galloped furiously to the rector of Cleves.  'O, Doctor Marchmont!' he cried, 'what a tale have I now to unfold! Within  these last twenty-four hours I have been the most wretched ... the happiest ...  and again the most agonized of human beings! I have thought Camilla bestowed  upon another, ... I have believed her, ... oh, Doctor!... my own!... I have  conceived myself at the summit of all earthly felicity!... I find myself, at  this moment deluded and undone!'  He then detailed the account, calling upon the Doctor to unravel to him the  insupportable ænigma of his destiny; to tell him for what purpose Camilla had  shewn him a tenderness so bewitching, at the very time she was carrying on a  clandestine intercourse with another? with a man, who, though destitute neither  of wit nor good qualities, it was impossible she should love, since she was as  incapable of admiring as of participating in his defects? To what  incomprehensible motives attribute such incongruities? Why accept and suffer  her friends to accept him, if engaged to Sir Sedley? why, if seriously meaning  to be his, this secret correspondence? Why so early, so private, so strange a  meeting? 'Whence, Doctor Marchmont, the daring boldness of his seizing her  hand? whence the never-to-be-forgotten licence with which he presumed to lift  it to his lips, ... and there hardily to detain it, so as never man durst do,  whose hopes were not all alive, from his own belief in their encouragement!  explain, expound to me this work of darkness and amazement; tell me why, with  every appearance of the most artless openness, I find her thus eternally  disingenuous and unintelligible? why, though I have cast myself wholly into her  power, she retains all her mystery ... she heightens it into deceit next  perjury?'  'Ask me, my dear young friend, why the sun does not give night, and the moon  day; then why women practise coquetry. Alas! my season for surprise has long  been passed! They will rather trifle, even with those they despise, than be  candid even with those they respect. The young baronet, probably, has been  making his court to her, or she has believed such was his design; but as you  first came to the point, she would not hazard rejecting you, while uncertain if  he were serious. She was, possibly, putting him to the test, by the account of  your declaration, at the moment of your unseasonable intrusion.'  'If this, Doctor, is your statement, and if your statement is just, in how  despicable a lottery have I risked the peace of my life! You suppose then ...  that, if sure of Sir Sedley ... I am discarded?'  'You know what I think of your situation: can I, when to yet more riches I add  a title, suppose that of Sir Sedley less secure?'  The shuddering start, the distracted look of Edgar, with his hand clapped to  his burning forehead, now alarmed the Doctor; who endeavoured to somewhat  soften his sentence, dissuading him against any immediate measures, and  advising him to pass over these first moments of emotion, and then coolly to  suffer inquiry to take place of decision. But Edgar could not hear him; he  shook hands with him, faintly smiled, as an apology for not speaking; and,  hurrying off, without waiting for his servant, galloped towards the New Forest:  leaving his absence from Cleves to declare his defection, and bent only to fly  from Camilla, and all that belonged to her.  All, however, that belonged to Camilla was precisely what followed him; pursued  him in every possible form, clung to his heart-strings, almost maddened his  senses. He could not bear to reflect; retrospection was torture, anticipation  was horror. To lose thus, without necessity, without calamity, the object of  his dearest wishes, ... to lose her from mere declension of esteem....  'Any inevitable evil,' he cried, 'I could have sustained; any blow of fortune,  however severe; any stroke of adversity, however terrible; ... but this ...  this error of all my senses ... this deception of all my hopes ... this  extinction of every feeling I have cherished'—  He rode on yet harder, leaping over every thing, thoughtless rather than  fearless of every danger he could encounter, and galloping with the speed and  violence of some pursuit, though wholly without view, and almost without  consciousness; as if, hoping by flight, to escape from the degenerate portrait  of Camilla: but its painter was his own imagination, and mocked the attempt.  From the other side of a five-barred gate, which, with almost frantic speed, he  was approaching with a view to clear, a voice halloo'd to stop him; and, at the  same time, a man who was leading one horse, and riding another, dismounted, and  called out, 'Why, as sure as I'm alive, it's 'Squire Mandlebert!'  Edgar now, perceiving Jacob, was going to turn back to avoid him; but,  restraining this first movement, faintly desired him to stand by, as he had not  a moment to lose.  'Good lack!' cried Jacob, with the freedom of an old servant, who had known him  from a boy; 'why, I would not but have happened to come this way for never so  much! why you might have broke your neck, else! Leap such a gate as this here?  why, I can't let you do no such a thing! Miss Camilla's like a child of my own,  as one may say; and she'll never hold up her head again, I'll be bound for it,  if you should come to any harm; and, as to poor old master! 'twould go nigh to  break his heart.'  Struck with words which, from so faithful an old servant, could not but be  touching, Edgar was brought suddenly to himself, and felt the claim of the  Tyrold family for a conduct more guarded. He endeavoured to put his own  feelings apart, and consider how best he might spare those of the friends of  Camilla; those of Camilla herself he concluded to be out of his reach, except  as they might simply relate to the female pride and vanity of refusing rather  than being given up.  He paused, now, to weigh how he might obviate any offence; and, after first  resolving to write a sort of general leave-taking, and, next, seeing the almost  insuperable objections to whatever he could state, determined upon gaining time  for deliberation, by merely commissioning Jacob to carry a message to Cleves,  that some sudden affairs called him, for the present, to a distant part of the  country. This, at such a period, would create a surprise that might lead the  way to what would follow: and Camilla, who could not, he thought, be much  astonished, might then take her own measures for the defection she would see  reason to expect.  But Jacob resisted bearing the intelligence: 'Good lack, sir,' he cried, 'what  have you got in your head? something that will do you no good, I'll be bound,  by the look of your eyes, which look as big as if they was both going to drop  out; you'd better come yourself and tell 'em what's the matter, and speak a  word to poor Miss Camilla, or she'll never believe but what some ill has  betided you. Why we all knew about it, fast enough, before our master told us;  servants have eyes as well as their masters; only Mary will have it she found  it out at the first, which an't true, for I saw it by the time you'd been a  week in the house; and if you'll take my word, squire, I don't think there's  such another heart in the world as Miss Camilla's, except just my own old  master's.'  Edgar leant against his horse, neither speaking nor moving, yet involuntarily  listening, while deeply sighing.  'What a power of good she'll do,' continued Jacob, 'when she's mistress of  Beech Park! I warrant she'll go about, visiting the poor, and making them  clothes, and broths, and wine possets, and baby-linen, all day long. She has  done it at Etherington quite from a child; and when she had nothing to give  'em, she used to take her thread papers and needle books, and sit down and work  for them, and carry them bits and scraps of things to help 'em to patch their  gowns. Why when she's got your fine fortunes, she'll bring a blessing upon the  whole county.'  Edgar felt touched; his wrath was softened into tenderness, and he ejaculated  to himself: 'Such, indeed, I thought Camilla! active in charity, gentle in good  works!... I thought that in putting my fortune into her hands, I was serving  the unhappy, ... feeding the indigent, ... reviving the sick!'  'Master,' continued Jacob, 'took a fancy to her from the very first, as well as  I; and when master said she was coming to live with us, I asked to make it a  holiday for all our folks, and master was as pleased as I. But nobody'd think  what a tender heart she's got of her own, without knowing her, because of her  singing, and laughing, and dancing so, except when old Miss Margland's in the  way, who's what Mr. Lionel calls a kill-joy at any time. Howbeit, I'll take  special care she shan't be by when I tell her of my stopping you from breaking  your neck here; but I wish you could be in a corner yourself, to peep at her,  without her knowing it; I'll warrant you she'll give me such a smile, you'd be  fit to eat her!'  Shaken once more in every resolution, because uncertain in every opinion, Edgar  found the indignant desperation which had seized him begin to subside, and his  mind again become assailable by something resembling hope. Almost instinctively  he remounted his horse, and almost involuntarily ... drawn on by hearkening to  the praise of Camilla, and fascinated by the details made by Jacob of her  regard, accompanied him back to Cleves.  As they rode into the park, and while he was earnestly endeavouring to form  some palliation, by which he might exculpate what seemed to him so guilty in  the strange meeting and its strange circumstances, he perceived Camilla  herself, walking upon the lawn. He saw she had observed him, and saw, from her  air, she seemed irresolute if to re-enter the house, or await him.  Jacob, significantly pointing her out, offered to shew the effect he could  produce by what he could relate; but Edgar, giving him the charge of his horse,  earnestly besought him to retire in quiet, and to keep his opinions and  experiments to himself.  Each now, separately, and with nearly equal difficulty, strove to attain  fortitude to seek an explanation. They approached each other; Camilla with her  eyes fixed upon the ground, her air embarrassed, and her cheeks covered with  blushes; Edgar with quick, but almost tottering steps, his eyes wildly avoiding  hers, and his complexion pale even to indisposition.  When they were met within a few yards, they stopt; Camilla still without  courage to look up, and Edgar striving to speak, but finding no passage for his  voice. Camilla, then, ashamed of her situation, raised her eyes, and forced  herself to say, 'Have you been into the house? Have you seen my cousin Lynmere?'  'No ... madam.'  Struck with a cold formality that never before, from Edgar, had reached her  ears, and shocked by the sight of his estranged and altered countenance, with  the cruel consciousness that appearances authorised the most depreciating  suspicions, she advanced, and holding out her hand, 'Edgar,' she gently cried,  'are you ill? or only angry?'  'O Camilla!' he answered, 'can you deign to use to me such a word? can you  distort my dearest affections, convulse my fairest hopes, eradicate every power  of happiness ... yet speak with so much sweetness ... yet look at me with such  mildness? such softness ... I had almost said ... such kindness?'  Deeply affected, she could hardly stand. He had taken her offered hand, but in  a manner so changed from the same action the preceding day, that she scarce  knew if he touched while he held it, scarce felt that he relinquished, as  almost immediately she withdrew it.  But her condescension at this moment was rather a new torment than any solace  to him. The hand which she proferred, and which the day before he had received  as the token of permanent felicity, he had now seen in the possession of  another, with every licence, every apparent mark of permitted rapture in which  he had been indulged himself. He knew not to whom it of right belonged; and the  doubt not merely banished happiness, but mingled resentment with misery.  'I see,' cried she, after a mortified pause; 'you have lost your good opinion  of me ... I can only, therefore....' She stopt, but his melancholy silence was  a confirmation of her suggestion that offended her into more exertion, and,  with sensibility raised into dignity, she added, 'only hope your intended tour  to the Continent may take place without delay!'  She would then have walked on to the house; but following her, 'Is all over?'  he cried, 'and is it thus, Camilla, we part?'  'Why not?' said she, suppressing a sigh, yet turning back.  'What a question! cruel Camilla! Is this all the explanation you allow me?'  'What other do you wish?'  'All!... every other!... that meeting ... those letters....'  'If you have any curiosity yet remaining ... only name what you desire.'  'Are you indeed so good?' cried he, in a voice that shewed his soul again  melting; 'those letters, then....'  'You shall have them ... every one!' she cried, with alacrity; and instantly  taking out her pocket-book, presented him with the prepared packet.  Penetrated by this unexpected openness and compliance, he snatched her hand,  with intent to press it to his lips; but again the recollection he had seen  that liberty accorded to Sir Sedley, joined to the sight of his writing,  checked him; he let it go; bowed his thanks with a look of grateful respect,  and attempting no more to stop her, walked towards the summer-house, to peruse  the letters.
