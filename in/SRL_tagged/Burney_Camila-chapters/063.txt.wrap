 Traits of Character  The following morning, Mrs. Mittin came with eager intelligence, that the  raffle was fixed for one o'clock; and, without any scruple, accompanied the  party to the shop, addressing herself to every one of the set as to a confirmed  and intimate friend. But her chief supporter was Mr. Dennel, whose praise of  her was the vehicle to his censure of his sister-in-law. That lady was the  person in the world whom he most feared and disliked. He had neither spirit for  the splendid manner in which she lived, nor parts for the vivacity of her  conversation. The first, his love of money made him condemn as extravagant, and  the latter his self-love made him hate, because he could not understand. He  persuaded himself, therefore, that she had more words than meaning; and  extolled all the obvious truths uttered by Mrs. Mittin, to shew his superior  admiration of what, being plain and incontrovertible, he dignified with the  panegyric of being sensible.  When they came upon the Pantiles, they were accosted by Mr. Dubster; who having  solemnly asked them, one by one, how they all did, joined Mrs. Mittin, saying:  'Well, I can't pretend as I'm over sorry you've got neither of those two  comical gentlemen with you, that behaved so free to me for nothing. I don't  think it's particular agreeable being treated so; though it's a thing I don't  much mind. It's not worth fretting about.'  'Well, don't say any more about it,' cried Mrs. Mittin, endeavouring to shake  him off; 'I dare say you did something to provoke 'em, or they're too genteel  to have taken notice of you.'  'Me provoke them! why what did I do? I was just like a mere lamb, as one may  say, at the very time that young Captain fell abusing me so, calling of me a  little dirty fellow, without no provocation. If I'm little, or big, I don't see  that it's any business of his. And as to dirty, I'd put on all clean linen but  the very day before, as the people can tell you at the inn; so the whole was a  mere piece of falsehood from one end to t'other.'  'Well, well, what do you talk about it for any more? You should never take  anything ill of a young gentleman. It's only aggravating him so much the worse.'  'Aggravating him, Mrs. Mittin! why what need I mind that? Do you think I'm to  put up with his talking of caning me, and such like, because of his being a  young gentleman? Not I, I assure you! I'm no such person. And if once I feel  his switch across these here shoulders, it won't be so well for him!'  The party now entered the shop where the raffle was to be held.  Edgar was already there; he had no power to keep away from any place where he  was sure to behold Camilla; and a raffle brought to his mind the most tender  recollections. He was now with Lord O'Lerney, in whose candour and benevolence  of character he took great delight, and with whom he had joined Lady Isabella  Irby, who had been drawn, as a quiet spectatress, to the sight, by a friend,  who, having never seen the humours of a raffle, had entreated, through her  means, to look on. He languished to see Camilla presented to this lady, in  whose manners and conversation, dignity and simplicity were equally blended.  While he was yet, though absently, conversing with them, Lord O'Lerney pointed  out Camilla to Lady Isabella.  'I have taken notice of her already at the Rooms;' answered her Ladyship; 'and  I have seldom, I think, seen a more interesting young creature.'  'The character of her countenance,' said Lord O'Lerney, 'strikes me very  peculiarly. 'Tis so intelligent, yet so unhackneyed, so full of meaning, yet so  artless, that, while I look at her, I feel myself involuntarily anxious for her  welfare.'  'I don't think she seems happy,' said Lady Isabella; 'Do you know who she is,  my Lord?'  Edgar, here, with difficulty suppressed a sigh. Not happy! thought he; ah!  wherefore? what can make Camilla unhappy?  'I understand she is a niece of Sir Hugh Tyrold,' answered his Lordship; 'a  Yorkshire Baronet. She is here with an acquaintance of mine, Mrs. Arlbery, who  is one of the first women I have ever known, for wit and capacity. She has an  excellent heart, too; though her extraordinary talents, and her carelessness of  opinion make it sometimes, but very unjustly, doubted.'  Edgar heard this with much pleasure. A good word from Lord O'Lerney quieted  many fears; he hoped he had been unnecessarily alarmed; he determined, in  future, to judge her more favourably.  'I should be glad,' continued his Lordship, 'to hear this young lady were  either well established, or returned to her friends without becoming an object  of public notice. A young woman is no where so rarely respectable, or  respected, as at these water-drinking places, if seen at them either long or  often. The search of pleasure and dissipation, at a spot consecrated for  restoring health to the sick, the infirm, and the suffering, carries with it an  air of egotism, that does not give the most pleasant idea of the feeling and  disposition.'  'Yet, may not the sick, my Lord, be rather amended than hurt by the sight of  gaiety around them?'  'Yes, my dear Lady Isabella; and the effect, therefore, I believe to be  beneficial. But as this is not the motive why the young and the gay seek these  spots, it is not here they will find themselves most honoured. And the mixture  of pain and illness with splendor and festivity, is so unnatural, that probably  it is to that we must attribute that a young woman is no where so hardly  judged. If she is without fortune, she is thought a female adventurer, seeking  to sell herself for its attainment; if she is rich, she is supposed a willing  dupe, ready for a snare, and only looking about for an ensnarer.'  'And yet, young women seldom, I believe, my Lord, merit this severity of  judgment. They come but hither in the summer, as they go to London in the  winter, simply in search of amusement, without any particular purpose.'  'True; but they do not weigh what their observers weigh for them, that the  search of public recreation in the winter is, from long habit, permitted  without censure; but that the summer has not, as yet, prescription so  positively in its favour; and those who, after meeting them all the winter at  the opera, and all the spring at Ranelagh, hear of them all the summer at  Cheltenham, Tunbridge, &c. and all the autumn at Bath, are apt to inquire, when  is the season for home.'  'Ah, my Lord! how wide are the poor inconsiderate little flutterers from being  aware of such a question! How necessary to youth and thoughtlessness is the  wisdom of experience!'  Why does she not come this way? thought Edgar; why does she not gather from  these mild, yet understanding moralists, instruction that might benefit all her  future life?  'There is nothing,' said Lord O'Lerney, 'I more sincerely pity than the  delusions surrounding young females. The strongest admirers of their eyes are  frequently the most austere satirists of their conduct.'  The entrance of Lord Newford, Sir Theophilus Jarard, and Sir Sedley Clarendel,  all noisily talking and laughing together, interrupted any further  conversation. The two former no sooner saw Camilla, and perceived neither Lady  Alithea Selmore, nor Mrs. Berlinton, than they made up to her; and Sir Sedley,  who now found she was completely established in the bon ton, felt something of  pride mix with pleasure in publicly availing himself of his intimacy with her;  and something like interest mix with curiosity, in examining if Edgar were  struck with her ready attention to him.  Upon Edgar, however, it made not the slightest impression. While Sir Sedley had  appeared to him a mere fop, he had thought it degraded her; but how he regarded  him as her preserver, it seemed both natural and merited.  Sir Sedley, not aware of this reasoning, was somewhat piqued; and taking him to  another part of the shop, whispered: 'I am horribly vapoured! Do you know I  have some thoughts of trying that little girl? Do you think one could make  anything of her?'  'How? what do you mean?' cried Edgar, with sudden alarm.  Sir Sedley, a little flattered, affectedly answered: 'O, if you have any  serious designs that way, incontestably I won't interfere.'  'Me!' cried Edgar, surprised and offended; 'believe me, no! I have all my life  considered her—as my sister.'  Sir Sedley saw this was spoken with effort; and negligently replied: 'Nay you  are just at the first epocha for marrying from inclination; but you are in the  right not to perform so soon the funeral honours of liberty. 'Tis what you may  do at any time. So many girls want establishments, that a man of sixty can just  as easily get a wife of eighteen, as a man of one-and-twenty. The only  inconvenience in that sort of alliance is, that though she begins with  submitting to her venerated husband as prettily as to her papa, she is terribly  apt to have a knack of running away from him, afterwards, with equal facility.'  'That is rather a discouraging article, I confess,' cried Edgar, 'for the tardy  votaries of Hymen!'  'O, no! 'tis no great matter!' answered he, patting his snuffbox; 'we are  impenetrable in the extreme to those sort of grievances now-a-days. We are at  such prodigious expence of sensibility in public, for tales of sorrow told  about pathetically, at a full board, that if we suffered much for our private  concerns to boot, we must always meet one another with tears in our eyes. We  never weep now, but at dinner, or at some diversion.'  Lord Newford, pulling him by the arm, called out: 'Come, Clary, what art about,  man? we want thee.'  'Come, Clary! don't shirk, Clary,' cried Sir Theophilus; 'I can't possibly  patronise this shirking.' And they hauled him to a corner of the shop, where  all three resumed their customary laughing whispers.  'You will not, perhaps, suspect, Lady Isabella,' said Lord O'Lerney, smiling,  'that one of that triumvirate is by no means deficient in parts, and can even,  when he desires it, be extremely pleasing?'  'Your Lordship judges right, I confess! I had not, indeed, done him such  justice!'  'See then,' said his Lordship, 'how futile an animal is man, without some  decided character and principle!  He's every thing by turns, and nothing long[3]. Wise, foolish; virtuous, vicious; active, indolent; prodigal and avaricious! No  contrast is too strong for him while guided but by accident or impulse. This  gentleman also, in common with the rest of his tonnish brethren, is now daily,  though unconsciously, hoarding up a world of unprepared-for mortification, by  not foreseeing that the more he is celebrated in his youth, for being the  leader of the ton, and the man of the day, the earlier he will be regarded as a  creature out of date, an old beau, and a fine gentleman of former times. But  'tis by reverses, such as these, that folly and impropriety pay their  penalties. We might spare all our anger against the vanity of the beauty, or  the conceit of the coxcomb. Are not wrinkles always in waiting to punish the  one, and age, without honour, to chastise and degrade the other?'  All the rafflers were now arrived, except Mrs. Berlinton, who was impatiently  expected. Lady Alithea Selmore had already sent a proxy to throw for her in her  own woman; much to the dissatisfaction of most part of the company. A general  rising and inquietude to look out for Mrs. Berlinton, gave Edgar, at length, an  opportunity to stand next to Camilla. 'How I grieve,' he cried 'you should not  know Lady Isabella Irby! she seems to me a model for a woman of rank in her  manners, and a model for a woman of every station in her mind. The world, I  believe, could scarce have tempted her to so offensive a mark of superiority as  has just been exhibited by Lady Alithea Selmore, who has ingeniously discovered  a method of being signalised as the most important person out of twenty, by  making herself nineteen enemies.'  'I wonder,' said Camilla, 'she can think the chance of the ear-rings worth so  high a price!'  A footman, in a splendid livery, now entering, inquired for Miss Tyrold. She  was pointed out to him by Major Cerwood, and he delivered her a letter from  Mrs. Berlinton.  The contents were to entreat she would throw for that lady, who was in the  midst of Akenside's Pleasures of the Imagination, and could not tear herself  away from them.  Camilla blushed excessively in proclaiming she was chosen Mrs. Berlinton's  proxy. Edgar saw with tenderness her modest confusion, and, with a pleasure the  most touching, read the favourable impression it made upon Lord O'Lerney and  Lady Isabella.  This seemed an opportunity irresistible for venting his fears and cautions  about Mrs. Berlinton; and, taking the bustling period in which the rafflers  were arranging the order and manner of throwing, he said, in a low, and  diffident tone of voice, 'You have committed to me an important and, I fear, an  importunate office; yet, while I hold, I cannot persuade myself not to fulfil  it; though I know that to give advice which opposes sentiment and feeling, is  repugnant to independence and to delicacy. Such, therefore, I do not mean to  enforce; but merely to offer hints—intimations—and observations—that  without controlling, may put you upon your guard.'  Camilla, affected by this unexpected address, could only look her desire for an  explanation.  'The lady,' he continued, 'whom you are presently to represent, appears to be  uncommonly engaging?—'  'Indeed she is! She is attractive, gentle, amiable.'  'She seems, also, already to have caught your affection?'  'Who could have withheld it, that had seen her as I have seen her? She is as  unhappy as she is lovely....'  'I have heard of your first meeting, with as much pleasure in the presence of  mind it called forth on one side, as with doubt and perplexity, upon every  circumstance I can gather, of the other.—'  'If you knew her, you would find it impossible to hold any doubts; impossible  to resist admiring, compassionating, and loving her!'  'If my knowledge of her bribed an interest in her favour, without convincing me  she deserved it, I ought, rather, to regret that you have not escaped falling  into such a snare, than that I could have escaped it myself.'  'I believe her free, nay incapable of all ill!' cried Camilla warmly; 'though I  dare not assert she is always coolly upon her guard.'  'Do not let me hurt you,' said Edgar, gently; 'I have seen how lovely she is in  person, and how pleasing in manners. And she is so young that, were she in a  situation less exposed, want of steadiness or judgment might, by a little time,  be set right. But here, there is surely much to fear from her early possession  of power.... O, that some happier chance had brought about such a peculiar  intercourse for you with Lady Isabella Irby! There, to the pleasure of  friendship, might be added the modesty of retired elegance, and the security of  established respectability.'  'And may not this yet happen, with Mrs. Berlinton? Lady Isabella, though still  young, is not in the extreme youth of Mrs. Berlinton: a few more years,  therefore, may bring equal discretion; and as she has already every other good  quality, you may hereafter equally approve her.'  'Do you think, then,' said Edgar, half smiling, 'that the few years of  difference in their age were spent by Lady Isabella in the manner they are now  spent by Mrs. Berlinton? do you think she paved the way for her present  dignified, though unassuming character, by permitting herself to be surrounded  by professed admirers? by letting their sighs reach her ears? by suffering  their eyes to fasten with open rapture on her face? and by holding it  sufficient not to suppress such liberties, so long as she does not avowedly  encourage them?'  Camilla was startled. She had not seen her conduct in this light: yet her  understanding refused to deny it might bear this interpretation.  Charmed with the candour of her silence, Edgar continued, 'How wide from all  that is open to similar comment, is the carriage and behaviour of Lady  Isabella! how clear! how transparent, how free from all conjecture of blemish!  They may each, indeed, essentially be equally innocent; and your opinion of  Mrs. Berlinton corroborates the impression made by her beautiful countenance:  yet how far more highly is the true feminine character preserved, where surmise  is not raised, than where it can be parried! Think but of those two ladies, and  mark the difference. Lady Isabella, addressed only where known, followed only  because loved, sees no adulators encircling her, for adulation would alarm her;  no admirers paying her homage, for such homage would offend her. She knows she  has not only her own innocence to guard, but the honour of her husband. Whether  she is happy with him or not, this deposit is equally sacred.—'  He stopt; for Camilla again started. The irrepressible frankness of her nature  revolted against denying how much this last sentence struck her, and she  ingenuously exclaimed: 'O that this most amiable young creature were but more  aware of this duty!'  'Ah, my dear Miss Camilla,' cried Edgar, with energy, 'since you feel and own  ... and with you, that is always one ... this baneful deficiency, drop, or at  least suspend an intercourse too hazardous to be indulged with propriety! See  what she may be sometime hence, ere you contract further intimacy. At present,  unexperienced and unsuspicious, her dangers may be yours. You are too young for  such a risk. Fly, fly from it, my dear Miss Camilla!... as if the voice of your  mother were calling out to caution you!'  Camilla was deeply touched. An interest so warm in her welfare was soothing,  and the name of her mother rendered it awful; yet, thus united, it appeared to  her more strongly than ever to announce itself as merely fraternal. She could  not suppress a sigh; but he attributed it to the request he had urged, and,  with much concern, added: 'What I have asked of you, then, is too severe?'  Again irresistibly sighing, yet collecting all her force to conceal the secret  cause, she answered, 'If she is thus exposed to danger ... if her situation is  so perilous, ought I not rather to stay by, and help to support her, than by  abandoning, perhaps contribute to the evil you think awaiting her?'  'Generous Camilla!' cried he, melted into tender admiration, 'who can oppose so  kind a design? So noble a nature!...'  No more could be said, for all preliminaries had been settled, and the throwing  being arranged to take place alphabetically, she was soon summoned to represent  Mrs. Berlinton.  From this time, Edgar could speak to her no more: even the Major could scarcely  make way to her: the two men of the ton would not quit her, and Sir Sedley  Clarendel appeared openly devoted to her.  Edgar looked on with the keenest emotion. The proof he had just received that  her intrinsic worth was in its first state of excellence, had come home to his  heart, and the fear of seeing her altered and spoilt, by the flatteries and  dangers which environed her, with his wavering belief in her engagement with  Major Cerwood, made him more wretched than ever. But when, some time after, she  was called upon to throw for herself, the recollection that, from the former  raffle, her half-guinea, even when the prize was in her hand, had been  voluntarily withdrawn to be bestowed upon a poor family, so powerfully affected  him, that he could not rest in the shop; he was obliged to breathe a freer air,  and to hide his disturbance by a retreat.  Her throw was the highest the dice had yet afforded. A Miss Williams alone came  after her, whose throw was the lowest; Miss Camilla Tyrold, therefore, was  proclaimed to be the winner.  This second testimony of the favour of fortune was a most pleasant surprise to  Camilla, and made the room resound with felicitations, till they were  interrupted by a violent quarrel upon the Pantiles, whence the voice of  Macdersey was heard, hollooing out: 'Don't talk, I say sir! don't presume to  say a word!' and that of Mr. Dubster angrily answering, he would talk as long  as he thought proper, whether it was agreeable or not.  Sir Sedley advanced to the combatants, in order to help on the dispute; but  Edgar, returning at the sound of high words, took the Ensign by the arm, and  prevailed with him to accompany him up and down the Pantiles; while Mrs. Mittin  ran to Mr. Dubster, and pulling him into the shop, said: 'Mr. Dubster, if I'm  not ashamed of you! how can you forget yourself so? talking to gentlemen at  such a rate!'  'Why what should hinder me?' cried he; 'do you think I shall put up with every  thing as I used to do when you first knew me, and we used to meet at Mr.  Typton's, the tallow chandler's, in Shug-lane? no, Mrs. Mittin, nor no such a  thing; I'm turned gentleman myself, now, as much as the best of 'em; for I've  nothing to do, but just what I choose.'  'I protest, Mr. Dubster,' cried Mrs. Mittin, taking him into a corner 'you're  enough to put a saint into a pet! how come you to think of talking of Mr.  Typton here? before such gentlefolks? and where's the use of telling every body  he's a tallow chandler? and as to my meeting with you there once or so, in a  way, I desire you'll mention it no more; for it's so long ago, I have no  recollection of it.'  'No! why don't you remember—'  'Fiddle, faddle, what's the good of ripping up old stories about nothing? when  you're with genteel people, you must do as I do; never talk about business at  all.'  Macdersey now entered the shop, appeased by Edgar from shewing any further  wrath, but wantonly inflamed by Sir Sedley, in a dispute upon the passion of  love.  'Do you always, my dear friend,' said the Baronet, 'fall in love at first  sight?'  'To be sure I do! If a man makes a scruple of that, it's ten to one but he's  disappointed of doing it at all; because, after two or three second sights, the  danger is you may spy out some little flaw in the dear angel, that takes off  the zest, and hinders you to the longest day you have to live.'  'Profoundly cogitated that! you think then, my vast dear sir, the passion had  more conveniently be kindled first, that the flaws may appear after, to cure  it?'  'No, sir! no! when a man's once in love, those flaws don't signify, because he  can't see them; or, if he could, at least he'd scorn to own them.'  'Live for ever brave Ireland!' exclaimed Mrs. Arlbery; 'what cold, phelgmatic  Englishman would have made a speech of so much gallantry?'  'As to an Englishman,' said Macdersey, 'you must never mind what he says about  the ladies, because he's too sheepish to speak out. He's just as often in love  as his neighbours, only he's so shy he won't own it, till he sees if the young  fair one is as much in love as himself; but a generous Irishman never scruples  to proclaim the girl of his heart, though he should have twenty in a year.'  'But is that perfectly delicate, my dearest sir, to the several Dulcineas?'  'Perfectly! your Irishman is the delicatest man upon earth to the fair sex; for  he always talks of their cruelty, if they are never so kind. He knows every  honest heart will pity him, if it's true; and if it i'n't, he is too much a man  of honour not to complain all one; he knows how agreeable it is to the dear  creatures; they always take it for a compliment.'  'Whether avowedly or clandestinely,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'still you are all in  our chains. Even where you play the tyrant with us, we occupy all your  thoughts; and if you have not the skill to make us happy, your next delight is  to make us miserable; for though, now and then, you can contrive to hate, you  can never arrive at forgetting us.'  'Contrive to hate you!' repeated Macdersey; 'I could as soon contrive to turn  the world into a potato; there is nothing upon earth, nothing under the whole  firmament I value but beauty!'  'A cheerful glass, then,' said Sir Sedley, 'you think horridly intolerable?'  'A cheerful glass, sir! do you take me for a milk-sop? do you think I don't  know what it is to be a man? a cheerful glass, sir, is the first pleasure in  life; the most convivial, the most exhilarating, the most friendly joy of a  true honest soul! what were existence without it? I should choose to be off in  half an hour; which I should only make so long, not to shock my friends.'  'Well, the glass is not what I patronise,' said Sir Theophilus; 'it hips me so  consumedly the next day; no, I can't patronise the glass.'  'Not patronise wine?' cried Lord Newford; 'O hang it! O curse it! that's too  bad, Offy! but hunting! what dost think of that, little Offy?'  'Too obstreperous! It rouses one at such aukward hours; no, I can't patronise  hunting.'  'Hunting!' cried Macdersey; 'O, it leaves everything behind it; 'tis the thing  upon the earth for which I have the truest taste. I know nothing else that is  not a bauble to it. A man is no more, in my estimation, than a child, or a  woman, that don't enjoy it.'  'Cards, then,' said Sir Sedley, 'you reprobate?'  'And dice?'—cried Lord Newford—  'And betting?'—cried Sir Theophilus.  'Why what do you take me for, gentlemen?' replied Macdersey, hotly; 'Do you  think I have no soul? no fire? no feeling? Do you suppose me a stone? a block?  a lump of lead? I scorn such suspicions; I don't hold them worth answering. I  am none of that torpid, morbid, drowsy tribe. I hold nobody to have an idea of  life that has not rattled in his own hand the dear little box of promise. What  ecstasy not to know if, in two seconds, one mayn't be worth ten thousand  pounds! or else without a farthing! how it puts one on the rack! There's  nothing to compare with it. I would not give up that moment to be sovereign of  the East Indies! no, not if the West were to be put into the bargain.'  'All these things,' said Mr. Dennel, 'are fit for nothing but to bring a man to  ruin. The main chance is all that is worth thinking of. 'Tis money makes the  mare to go; and I don't know any thing that's to be done without it.'  'Money!' exclaimed Macdersey, 'tis the thing under heaven I hold in the most  disdain. It won't give me a moment's concern never to see its colour again. I  vow solemnly, if it were not just for the pleasures of the table, and a jolly  glass with a friend, and a few horses in one's stable, and a little ready cash  in one's purse, for odd uses, I should not care if the mint were sunk under  ground to-morrow; money is what I most despise of all.'  'That's talking out of reason,' said Mr. Dennel, walking out of the shop with  great disgust.  'Why, if I was to speak,' said Mr. Dubster, encouraged to come forward, by an  observation so much to his own comprehension and taste as the last; 'I can't  but say I think the same; for money—'  'Keep your distance, sir!' cried the fiery Ensign, 'keep your distance, I tell  you! if you don't wish I should say something to you pretty cutting.'  This broke up the party, which else the lounging spirit of the place, and the  general consent by which all descriptions of characters seem determined to  occupy any spot whatever, to avoid a moment's abode in their lodgings, would  still have detained till the dinner hour had forced to their respective homes.  To suppress all possibility of further dissention, Mrs. Arlbery put Miss Dennel  under the care of Macdersey, and bid him attend her towards Mount Pleasant.  Mr. Dubster, having stared after them some time in silence, called out: 'Keep  my distance! I can't but say but what I think that young Captain the rudest  young gentleman I ever happened to light upon! however, if he don't like me, I  shan't take it much to heart; I can't pretend to say I like him any better; so  he may choose; it's much the same to me; it breaks no squares.'  Edgar, almost without knowing it, followed Camilla, but he could displace  neither the Baronet nor the Major, who, one with a look of open exultation, and  the other with an air of determined perseverance, retained each his post at her  side.  He saw that all her voluntary attention was to Sir Sedley, and that the Major  had none but what was called for and inevitable. Was this indifference, or  security? was she seeking to obtain in the Baronet a new adorer, or to excite  jealousy, through his means, in an old one? Silent he walked on, perpetually  exclaiming to himself: 'Can it be Camilla, the ingenuous, the artless Camilla,  I find it so difficult to fathom, to comprehend, to trust?'  He had not spirits to join Mrs. Arlbery, though he lamented he had not, at  once, visited her; since it was now awkward to take such a step without an  invitation, which she seemed by no means disposed to offer him. She internally  resented the little desire he had ever manifested for her acquaintance; and  they had both too much penetration not to perceive how wide either was from  being the favourite of the other.
