 A Pleasant Adventure  Camilla was again called upon for her note, before she had read the letter it  was to answer; but relieved now from the pressure of her own terrifying  apprehensions, she gave it complete and willing attention.  It contained four sides of paper, closely yet elegantly written in the language  of romantic sentiment. Mrs. Berlinton said she had spent, as yet, only a few  minutes with her aunt; but they had been awfully important; and since she had  exacted from her a promise to stay the whole day, she could not deny her  disappointed friendship the transient solace of a paper conversation, to sooth  the lingering interval of this unexpected absence. 'My soul pines to unburden  the weight of its sorrows into thy sympathising bosom, my gentlest friend; but  oh! there let them not sojourn! receive but to lighten, listen but to  commiserate, and then, far, far thence dismiss them, retaining but the  remembrance thou hast dismissed them with consolation.' She then bewailed the  time lost to soft communication and confidence, in their journey, from the  presence of others; for though one was a brother she so truly loved, she found,  notwithstanding the tenderness of his nature, he had the prejudices of a man  upon man's prerogatives, and her woes called for soothing not arguments; and  the other, she briefly added, was but an accidental passenger. ''Tis in thee  only, O my beauteous friend! I would trust the sad murmurs of my irreversible  and miserable destiny, of which I have learnt but this moment the cruel and  desperate secret cause.' She reserved, however, the discovery for their  meeting, and called upon her pity for her unfortunate brother, as deeply  involved in his future views, as she in her past, by this mystery: 'And have I  written this much,' she burst forth, 'without speaking of the cherished  correspondent whom so often I have described to thee? Ah! believe me not  faithless to that partner of my chosen esteem, that noble, that resistless  possessor of my purest friendship! No, charming Camilla, think not so  degradingly of her whom fate, in its sole pitying interval, has cast into thy  arms.' Two pages then ensued with this exclusive encomium, painting him chief  in every virtue, and master of every grace. She next expressed her earnestness  to see Indiana, [who] Camilla had told her would be at Southampton. 'Present  me, I conjure thee, to the fair and amiable enslaver of my unhappy brother! I  die to see, to converse with her, to catch from her lovely lips the modest  wisdom with which he tells me they teem; to read in her speaking eyes the  intelligence which he assures me illumines them.' She concluded with desiring  her to give what orders she pleased for the coach, and the servants, and to  pass the day with her friends.  Camilla, whose own sensations were now revived to happiness, read the letter  with all the sympathy it claimed, and felt her eyes fill with generous tears at  the contrast of their situations; yet she highly blamed the tenderness  expressed for the unknown correspondent, though its innocence she was sure must  vanquish even Edgar, since its so constant avowal proved it might be published  to all mankind. She answered her in language nearly as affectionate, though  less inflated than her own, and resolved to support her with Edgar, till her  sweetness and purity should need no champions but themselves. She was ashamed  of the species of expectation raised for Indiana, yet knew not how to interfere  in Melmond's idea of her capacity, lest it might seem unkind to represent its  fallaciousness; but she was glad to find her soft friend seemed to have a  strict guardian in her brother; and wished eagerly to communicate to Edgar a  circumstance which she was sure would be so welcome to him.  Impatient to see Eugenia, she accepted the offer of the carriage, and desirous  to escape Mrs. Mittin, begged to have it immediately; but that notable person  came to the door at the same time as the coach, and, without the smallest  ceremony, said she would accompany her to the hotel, in order to take the  opportunity of making acquaintance with her friends.  Courage frequently, at least in females, becomes potent as an agent, where it  has been feeble as a principal. Camilla, though she had wished, upon her own  account, to repress Mrs. Mittin in the morning, had been too timid for such an  undertaking; but now, in her anxiety to oblige Edgar, she gathered resolution  for declining her company. She then found, as is generally the case with the  fearful, the task less difficult than she had expected; for Mrs. Mittin,  content with a promise self-made, that the introduction should take place the  next day, said she would go and help Mrs. Berlinton's woman to unpack her  lady's things, which would make a useful friend for her in the house, for a  thousand odd matters.  The carriage of Sir Hugh was just driving off as Camilla arrived at the hotel.  She hurried from Mrs. Berlinton's coach, demanding which way the company was  gone; and being answered, by a passing waiter, up stairs, ran on at once,  without patience or thought for asking if she should turn to the right or left;  till seeing a gentleman standing still upon the landing place, and leaning upon  the bannisters, she was retreating, to desire a conductor, when she perceived  it was Dr. Orkborne; who, while the ladies were looking at accommodations, and  inquiring about lodgings, in profound cogitation, and with his tablets in his  hands, undisturbed by the various noises around him, and unmoved by the various  spectators continually passing and repassing, was finishing a period which he  had begun in the coach for his great work.  Camilla, cheerfully greeting him, begged to know which way she should find  Eugenia; but, making her a sign not to speak to him, he wrote on. Accustomed to  his manner, and brought up to respect whatever belonged to study, from the  studious life and turn of her father, she obeyed the mute injunction, and  waited quietly by his side; till, tired of the delay, though unwilling to  interrupt him, she glided softly about the passage, watching and examining if  she could see any of the party, yet fearing to offend or mortify him if she  called for a waiter.  While straying about thus, as far off as she could go without losing sight of  Dr. Orkborne, a door she had just passed was flung open, and she saw young  Halder, whose licentious insolence had so much alarmed her in the  bathing-house, stroam out, yawning, stretching, and swearing unmeaningly, but  most disgustingly, at every step.  Terrified at his sight, she went on, as she could not get to the Doctor without  passing him; but the youth, recollecting her immediately, called out: 'Ah, ha!  are you there again, you little vixen?' and pursued her.  'Dr. Orkborne! Dr. Orkborne!' she rather screamed than said, 'pray come this  way! I conjure—I beseech—I entreat—Dr. Orkborne!—'  The Doctor, catching nothing of this but his name, querulously exclaimed: 'You  molest me much!' but without raising his eyes from his tablets; while Halder,  at the appeal, cried: 'Ay, ay, Doctor! keep your distance, Doctor! you are best  where you are, Doctor, I can tell you, Doctor!'  Camilla, then, too much scared to be aware she ran a far greater risk than she  escaped, desperately sought refuge by opening the nearest door; though by the  sudden noises upon the stairs, and in all the adjoining passages, it seemed as  if Dr. Orkborne were the only one not alarmed by her cries.  No one, however, could approach so soon as the person of whose chamber she had  burst the door; who was an old gentleman, of a good and lively countenance, who  promptly presenting himself, looked at her with some surprise, but good  humouredly asked her what she was pleased to want in his room.  'That gentleman,' she cried, panting and meaning to point to Dr. Orkborne;  'that gentleman I want, sir!' but such a medley of waiters, company, and  servants, had in a moment assembled in the space between them, that the Doctor  was no longer to be discerned.  'Do you only open my door, then,' said he, drily, 'to tell me you want somebody  else?'  Yet when Halder, vowing he owed her an ill turn for which she should pay, would  have seized her by the hand, he protected with his own arm, saying: 'Fie, boy,  fie! let the girl alone! I don't like violence.'  A gentleman now, forcing himself through the crowd, exclaimed: 'Miss Camilla  Tyrold! Is it possible! what can you do here, madam?'  It was Dr. Marchmont, whom the affrighted Camilla, springing forward, could  only answer in catching by the arm.  'Tyrold!' repeated the old gentleman; 'Is her name Tyrold?'  Sorry now to have pronounced it in this mixt company, Dr. Marchmont evaded any  answer; and, begging her to be composed, asked whither, or to whom, he might  have the honour of conducting her.  'Almost all my family are here,' cried she, 'but I could not make Dr. Orkborne  shew me the way to them.'  The old gentleman then, repeating 'Tyrold! why if her name is Tyrold, I'll take  care of her myself;' invited her into his apartment.  Dr. Marchmont, thanking him, said: 'This young lady has friends, who in all  probability are now uneasily seeking her; we must lose no time in joining them.'  'Well, but, well,' cried the old stranger, 'let her come into my room till the  coast is clear, and then take her away in peace. Come, there's a good girl,  come in, do! you're heartily welcome; for there's a person of your name that's  the best friend I ever had in the world. He's gone from our parts, now; but  he's left nothing so good behind. Pray, my dear, did you ever hear of a  gentleman, an old Yorkshire Baronet, of your name?'  'What! my uncle?'  'Your uncle! why are you niece to Sir Hugh Tyrold?'  Upon her answering yes, he clapped his hands with delight, and saying: 'Why  then I'll take care of you myself, if it's at the risk of my life!' carried,  rather than drew her into his room, the Doctor following. Then, loudly shutting  his door in the face of Halder, he called out: 'Enter my castle who dare! I  shall turn a young man myself, at the age of seventy, to drub the first varlet  that would attack the niece of my dear old friend!'  They soon heard the passage clear, and, without deigning to listen to the  petulant revilings with which young Halder solaced his foolish rage, 'Why, my  dear,' he continued, 'why did not you tell me your name was Tyrold at once? I  promise you, you need carry nothing else with you into our parts, to see all  the doors fly open to you. You make much of him, I hope, where he is? for he  left not a dry eye for twenty miles round when he quitted us. I don't know how  many such men you may have in Hampshire; but Yorkshire's a large county, yet  the best man in it would find it hard to get a seat in Parliament, where Sir  Hugh Tyrold would offer himself to be a candidate. We all say, in Yorkshire,  he's so stuffed full of goodness and kindness, that there's no room left in him  for anything else; that's our way of talking of him in Yorkshire; if you have a  better way in Hampshire, I shall be glad to learn it; never too late for that;  I hate pride.'  No possible disturbance could make Camilla insensible to pleasure in the praise  of her uncle, or depress her spirits from joining in his eulogy; and her  attention, and brightening looks, drew a narrative from the old gentleman of  the baronet's good actions and former kindnesses, so pleasant both to the  speaker and the hearer, that the one forgot he had never seen her before, and  the other, the frightful adventure which occasioned their meeting now.  Dr. Marchmont at length, looking at his watch, inquired what she meant to do;  to seek her sister and party, she answered; and, returning her host the warmest  acknowledgments for his assistance and goodness, she was going; but, stopping  her: 'How now?' he cried, 'don't you want to know who I am? Now I have told you  I am a friend of your uncle, don't you suppose he'll ask you my name?'  Camilla, smiling, assured him she wished much to be informed, but knew not how  to trouble him with the question.  'Why my name, my dear, is Westwyn, and when you say that to your uncle, he  won't give you a sour look for your pains; take my word for that beforehand. I  carried over his nephew and heir, a cousin, I suppose, of yours, to Leipsic  with me, about eight years ago, along with a boy of my own, Hal Westwyn; a very  good lad, I assure you, though I never tell him so to his face, for fear of  puffing him up; I hate a boy puffed up; he commonly comes to no good; that's  the only fault of my honoured friend; he spoils all young people—witness that  same cousin of yours, that I can't say I much like; no more does he me; but  tell your good uncle you have met me; and tell him I love and honour him as I  ought to do; I don't know how to do more, or else I would; tell him this, my  dear. And I have not forgot what he did for me once, when I was hard run; and I  don't intend it; I'm no friend to short memories.'  Camilla said, his name, and her uncle's regard for him, had long been familiar  to her; and told him Clermont Lynmere was of the party to Southampton, though  she knew not how to enter abruptly into an explanation of his mistake  concerning the inheritance. Mr. Westwyn answered he was in no hurry to see  Clermont, who was not at all to his taste; but would not quit Hampshire without  visiting Cleves: and when he gathered that two more nieces of Sir Hugh were in  the house, he desired to be presented to them.  Upon re-entering the passage, to the great amusement of Dr. Marchmont, and  serious provocation of Camilla, they perceived Dr. Orkborne, standing precisely  where he had first stationed himself; attending no more to the general hubbub  than to her particular entreaty, and as regardless of the various jolts he had  received during the tumult, as of the obstruction he caused, by his  inconvenient position, to the haste of the passers by. Still steadily reposing  against the bannisters, he worked hard at refining his paragraph, persuaded,  since not summoned by Miss Margland, he had bestowed upon it but a few minutes,  though he had been fixed to that spot near an hour.  Miss Margland received Camilla with a civility which, since her positive and  public affiance to Edgar, she thought necessary to the mistress of Beech Park;  but she looked upon Dr. Marchmont, whom she concluded to have been her  advocate, with a cold ill-will, which, for Mr. Westwyn, she seasoned still more  strongly by a portion of contemptuous haughtiness; from a ready disposition to  believe every stranger, not formally announced, beneath her notice.  The Doctor soon retired, and found Edgar in his apartment, just returned from a  long stroll. He recounted to him the late transaction, with reiterated  exhortations to circumspection, from added doubts of the solidity, though with  new praise of the attractions of Camilla. 'She seems a character,' he said,  'difficult to resist, and yet more difficult to attach. Nothing serious appears  to impress her for two minutes together. Let us see if the thoughtlessness and  inadvertence thus perpetually fertile of danger, result from youthful  inexperience, or have their source in innate levity. Time and reason will  rectify the first; but time, and even reason, will but harden and embolden the  latter. Prudence, therefore, must now interfere; or passion may fly, when the  union it has formed most requires its continuance.'
