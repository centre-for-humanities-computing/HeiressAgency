 The right Style of Arguing  Camilla was received with the most tender joy by all her family, again  re-assembled at Cleves to welcome the return of young Lynmere, who was expected  every hour. Sir Hugh, perfectly recovered from his late illness, and busy,  notwithstanding all remonstrance, in preparation for the approaching nuptials,  was in spirits that exhilarated whoever saw him. Eugenia awaited that event  with gentleness, though with varying sensations; from fears, lest her personal  misfortunes should prove repulsive to Clermont, and from wishes to find him  resembling Melmond in talents, and Bellamy in passion and constancy.  Dr. Orkborne gave now his lessons with redoubled assiduity, from an ambition to  produce to the scholastic traveller, a phenomenon of his own workmanship in a  learned young female: nor were his toils less ready, nor less pleasant, for a  secret surmise they would shortly end; though not till honour should be united  with independence, for his recompence. But Miss Margland fretted, that this  wedding would advance no London journey; and Indiana could not for a moment  recover from her indignation, that the deformed and ugly Eugenia, though two  years younger than herself, should be married before her. Lavinia had no  thought but for the happiness of her sister; and Mr. Tyrold lamented the  absence of his wife, who, alike from understanding and affection, was the only  person to properly superintend this affair, but from whom Dr. Marchmont, just  arrived, brought very faint hopes of a speedy return.  Eugenia, however, was not the sole care of her father, at this period. The  countenance of Camilla soon betrayed, to his inquiring eyes, the inefficacy of  the Tunbridge journey. But he forbore all question; and left to time or her  choice to unravel, if new incidents kept alive her inquietude, or, if no  incident at all had been equally prejudicial to her repose.  Two days after, while Camilla, still astonished by no news, nor sight of Edgar,  was sitting with her sisters, and recounting to them her late adventures, and  present difficulties, with Sir Sedley Clarendel, Jacob brought her, in its own  superb bird-cage, the learned little bullfinch; telling her, it had been  delivered to him without any message, by a man who said she had left it, by  mistake, at Tunbridge; whence he had had orders to follow her with it to Cleves  park.  She was much provoked thus to receive it. Mrs. Arlbery had pressed her to take  it in her uncle's chaise, which she had firmly refused; and she now concluded  this method was adopted, that Sir Sedley might imagine she detained it as his  gift.  In drawing out, soon after, the receptacle for the bird's nourishment, she  perceived, written with a pencil upon the wood, these words: 'Thou art gone  then, fair fugitive! Ah! at least, fly only where thou mayst be pursued!'  This writing had not been visible till the machine was taken out to be  replenished. She recollected the hand of Sir Sedley, and was now sure it was  sent by himself, and could no longer, therefore, doubt his intentions being  serious.  With infinite perplexity she consulted with her sisters; but, when candidly she  had related, that once, to her never-ending regret, she had apparently welcomed  his civilities, Eugenia pronounced her rectitude to be engaged by that error,  as strongly as her gratitude by the preservation of her life, and the  extraordinary service done to Lionel, not to reject the young baronet, should  he make his proposals.  She heard this opinion with horror. Timid shame, and the counsel of her father,  united to impede her naming the internal obstacle which she felt to be  insurmountable; and, while casting up, in silence, her appealing eyes to Heaven  for relief, from the intricacy in which she found herself involved, she saw  Lionel galloping into the park.  She flew to meet him, and he dismounted, and led his horse, to walk with her.  She flattered herself, she might now represent the mischief he was doing, and  obtain from him some redress. But he was more wild and impracticable than ever.  'Well, my dear girl,' he cried, 'when are all these betterings and worsings to  take place? Numps has sent for me to see poor little Greek and Latin hobble to  the altar; but, 'tis a million to one, if our noble baronet does not whisk you  there before her. He's a charming fellow, faith. I had a good long confab with  him this morning.'  'This morning? I hope, then, you were so good, so just, as to tell him when you  mean to pay the money you have borrowed?'  'My dear child, I often think you were born but yesterday, only, by some  accident, you came into the world, like Minerva, grown up and ready dressed.  What makes you think I mean to pay him? Have I given him any bond?'  'A bond? Is that necessary to justice and honour?'  'If I had asked the money, you are right, my dear; I ought, then, certainly, to  refund. But, as it now stands, 'tis his own affair. I have nothing to do with  it: except, indeed, receiving the dear little golden boys, and making merry  with them.'  'O fie, Lionel, fie!'  'Why, what had I to do with it? Do you think he would care one fig if he saw me  sunk to the bottom of the Red Sea? No, my dear, no; you are the little debtor;  so balance your accounts for yourself, and don't cast them upon your poor  neighbours, who have full enough to settle of their own.'  Camilla was thunderstruck; 'And have you been so cruel,' she cried, 'seeing the  matter in such a light, to place me in such a predicament?'  'Cruel, my dear girl? why, what will it cost you, except a dimple or two the  more? And don't you know you always look best when you smile? I assure you,  it's a mercy he don't see you when you are giving me one of my lectures. It  disfigures you so horribly, that he'd take fright and never speak to you again.'  'What can I ever say, to make you hear me, or feel for me? Tell me, at least,  what has passed this morning; and assure me that nothing new, nothing yet  worse, has occurred.'  'O no, nothing at all. All is in the fairest train possible. I dare say, he'll  come hither, upon the grand question, before sun-set.'  Camilla gasped for breath, and was some time before she could ask whence he  drew such a conclusion.  'O, because I see he's in for it. I have a pretty good eye, my dear! He said,  too, he had such a prodigious ... friendship, I think he called it, for you,  that he was immeasurably happy, and all that, to be of the least service to  your brother. A fine fellow, upon my word! a fine generous spark as ever I saw.  He charged me to call upon him freely when I had any little embarrassment, or  difficulty, or was hard run, or things of that sort. He's a fine buck, I tell  you, and knows the world perfectly, that I promise you. He's none of your  drivellers, none of your ignoramuses. He has the true notion of things. He's  just a right friend for me. You could not have made a better match.'  Camilla, in the most solemn manner, protested herself disengaged in thought,  word, and deed; and declared her fixed intention so to continue. But he only  laughed at her declarations, calling them maidenly fibs; and, assuring her, the  young baronet was so much in earnest, she might as well be sincere as not.  'Besides,' he added, ''tis not fair to trifle where a man behaves so handsomely  and honourably. Consider the £.200!'  'I shall quite lose my senses, Lionel!' cried she, in an agony; 'I shall quite  lose my senses if you speak in this manner!'  Lionel shouted aloud; 'Why, my dear girl, what is £.200 to Sir Sedley  Clarendel? You talk as if he had twenty pound a-year for pin-money, like you  and Lavinia, that might go with half a gown a-year, if good old Numps did not  help you. Why, he's as rich as Crœsus, child. Besides, he would have been  quite affronted if I had talked of paying him such a trifle, for he offered me  any thing I pleased. O, he knows the world, I promise you! He's none of your  starched prigs. He knows life, my dear! He said, he could perfectly conceive  how hard it must be to a lad of spirit, like me, to be always exact. I don't  know that I ever made a more agreeable acquaintance in my life.'  Camilla was in an agitation that made him regard her, for a moment, with a  serious surprise; but his natural levity soon resumed its post, and, laughing  at himself for being nearly, he said, taken in, by her childish freaks, he  protested he would bite no more: 'For, after all, you must not think to make a  fool of me, my dear. It won't do. I'm too knowing. Do you suppose, if he had  not already made up his mind to the noose, and was not sure you had made up  yours to letting it be tied, he would have cared for poor me, and my scrapes?  No, no; whatever he does for me, before you are married, you may set down in  your own memorandum book: whatever he may please to do afterwards, I am content  should be charged to poor Pillgarlick.'  He then bid her good-morrow, by the name of Lady Clarendel; and said, he would  go and see if little Greek and Latin were as preposterous a prude about young  Lynmere.  Camilla remained almost petrified with amazement at her own situation; and only  was deterred from immediately opening her whole heart and affairs to her  father, with the confidence to which his indulgence entitled him, by the  impossibility of explaining her full distress without betraying her brother.
