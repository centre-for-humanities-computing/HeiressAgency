 Live and Learn  Before the Cleves party assembled to breakfast, after the various arrangements  made for Southampton, Mr. Dubster arrived, and demanded an interview with Sir  Hugh, who, attending Mr. Dubster to the drawing-room, asked Mr. Dubster pleasure.  'Why, have not you read the young gentleman's letter, Sir  ?' cried Sir  ,  surprised, 'because, Sir   said, Sir  'd put it all down, clear as a pike staff, to  save time.'  Sir   had not heard of it.  'Why, then, if you please, Sir  , we'll go and ask that elderly gentlewoman, what  she's done with it. she might as well have shewed it, after the young  gentleman's taking the trouble to write it to she. But she is none of the good  naturedest, I take it.'  Repairing, then, to Miss Margland, after his usual bows to all the company, 'I  ask pardon, ma'am,' his cried; 'but pray, what's the reason of your keeping the  young gentleman's letter to yourself, which was writ o'purpose to let the old  gentleman know what I come for?'  'Because I never trouble his with any thing that's impertinent,' she  haughtily answered: though, in fact, when the family had retired, she had  stolen downstairs, and read the letter; which contained a warm recommendation  of Mr. Dubster to she favour, with abundant flippant offers to promote she own  interest for so desirable a match, should she prove blind to its  advantages. This she had then burnt, with a determination never to acknowledge  she condescension in opening it.  The repeated calls of Mr. Dubster procuring no further satisfaction; 'Why,  then, I don't see,' Mr. Dubster said, 'but what I'm as bad off, as if the young  gentleman had not writ the letter, for I've got to speak for Mr. Dubster at last.'  Taking Sir Hugh, then, by a button of Sir Hugh coat, Sir Hugh desired Sir Hugh would go back  with Sir Hugh to the other parlour: and there, with much circumlocution, and  unqualified declarations of Sir Hugh having given over all thoughts of further  marrying, till the young gentleman over persuaded Sir Hugh of Sir Hugh being particular  agreeable to the young lady, Sir Hugh solemnly proposed Sir Hugh for Miss Camilla  Tyrold.  Sir Hugh, who perceived in this address nothing that was ridiculous, was  somewhat drawn from reflecting on Sir Hugh own disappointment, by the pity Sir Hugh  conceived for this hopeless suitor, to whom, with equal circumlocution of  concern, Sir Hugh communicated, that Sir Hugh niece was on the point of marriage with a  neighbour.  'I know that,' replied Mr. Dubster, nodding sagaciously, 'the young gentleman  having told me of the young baronight; but Mr. Dubster said, it was all against his niece  will, being only your over teasing, and the like.'  'The Lord be good unto Mr. Dubster!' exclaimed the baronet, holding up The Lord hands; 'if I  don't think all the young boys have a mind to drive me out of my wits, one  after t'other!'  Hurrying, then, back to the breakfast parlour, and to Camilla, 'Come hither, my  dear,' the baronet cried, 'for here's a gentleman come to make the baronet addresses to you,  that won't take an answer.'  Every serious thought, and every melancholy apprehension in Camilla gave place,  at this speech, to the ludicrous image of such an admirer as Mr. Dubster,  foisted upon her by the ridiculous machinations of Lionel. her took Sir Hugh by  the hand, and, drawing Sir Hugh away to the most distant window, said, in a low  voice, 'My dear uncle, this is a mere trick of Lionel; the person you see here  is, I believe, a tinker.'  'A tinker!' repeated Sir Hugh, quite loud, in defiance of the signs and hists!  hists! of Camilla, 'good lack! that's a person I should never have thought of!'  Then, walking up to Mr. Dubster, who was taking into his hands all the  ornaments from the chimney-piece, one by one, to examine, 'Sir,' Sir said, 'you  may be a very good sort of man, and I don't doubt but you are, for I've a  proper respect for every trade in its way; but in point of marrying my niece,  it's a thing I must beg you to put out of your head; it not being a proper  subject to talk of to a young lady, from a person in that line.'  'Very well, Sir,' answered Mr. Dubster, stiffly, and pouting, 'it's not of much  consequence; don't make yourself uneasy. There's nothing in what I was going to  propose but what was quite genteel. I'd scorn to address a lady else. a lady else'd  have a good five hundred a-year, in case of outliving me.'  'Good lack! five hundred a-year! who'd have thought of such a thing by the  tinkering business?'  'the  tinkering business, did you say, Sir?' cried Mr. Dubster, strutting up to the  baronet, with a solemn frown.  'The tinkering business, my good friend. An't you a tinker?'  'Sir!' cried Mr. Dubster, swelling, 'I did not think, when I was coming to make  such a handsome offer, of being affronted at such a rate as this. Not that I  mind it. It's not worth fretting about. However, as to a tinker, I'm no more a  tinker than yourself, whatever put it in your head.'  'Good lack, my dear,' cried the  baronet, to Camilla, 'the gentleman quite  denies the  baronet.'  Camilla, though unable to refrain from laughing, confessed Camilla had received the  information from Mrs. Arlbery at the Northwick breakfast, who, Camilla now  supposed, had said it in random sport.  Sir cordially begged Sir pardon, and asked his pardon to take a seat at the  breakfast table, to soften the undesigned offence.  A note now arrived from Mr. Tyrold to the  baronet. the  baronet contained the  baronet consent to  return, with Lavinia, to Cleves, and the  baronet ready acquiescence in the little  excursion to Southampton, since Miss Margland would be superintendant of the  party; 'and since,' the  baronet added, 'the  party will have another guardian, to whom already  I consign my Camilla, and, upon my Camilla account, my dear Eugenia also, with the  same fearless confidence I should feel in seeing the  party again under the maternal  wing.'  Sir Hugh, who always read the  baronet letters aloud, said, when the  baronet had done: 'See what  it is to be a good boy! my brother looks upon young Mr. Edgar as these young  girls' husband already; that is, of one of these young  girls'; by which means the other  becomes my brother sister; which, I'm sure, is a trouble my brother won't mind, except as a  pleasure.'  my Camilla's distress at this speech past unnoticed, from the abrupt entrance of  Lynmere, giving orders aloud to his servant to get ready for Southampton.  Inflamed with triumph in his servant recent success in baffling his servant uncle, that youth  was in the most turbulent spirits, and fixed a resolution either to lord that youth    over the whole house, or regain at once his servant liberty for returning to the  Continent.  Forcing a chair between Sir Hugh and Camilla, his servant seized rapidly whatever looked  most inviting from every plate on the table, to place upon his servant own, murmuring  the whole time against the horses, declaring the stud the most wretched his servant had  ever seen, and protesting the old groom must be turned away without loss of  time.  'What, Jacob?' cried the baronet; 'why, nephew, Jacob has lived with me from a  boy; and now Jacob's grown old, I'd sooner rub down every horse with my own hand,  than part with Jacob.'  'Jacob must certainly go, Jacob. There's no keeping Jacob. I may be tempted else to  knock Jacob brains out some day. Besides, I have a very good fellow I can  recommend to you of my own.'  'Clermont, I've no doubt of Clermont being a good fellow, which I'm very glad of;  but as to your always knocking out the brains of my servants, it's a thing I  must beg you not to talk of any more, being against the law. Besides which, it  don't sound very kind of you, considering their having done you no harm; never  having seen your face, as one may say, except just to wait upon you; which can  hardly be reckoned a bad office; besides a servant's being a man, as well as  you; whether Homer and Horace tell you so or no.'  To see Jacob displeased, was a sight new to the whole house. Camilla and  Eugenia, mutually pained for Jacob, endeavoured, by various little kind offices,  to divert Jacob attention; but Indiana thought Jacob displeasure proved her brother  to be a wit; and Clermont rose in spirits and in insolence upon the same idea:  too shallow to know, that of all the qualities with which the perversity of  human nature is gifted, and power which is the most common to attain, and the  most easy to practise, is the art of provoking.  Jacob now appearing, Lynmere ordered some shrimps.  There were none.  'No shrimps? There's nothing to be had! 'Tis a wretched county this!'  'You'll get nice shrimps at Southampton, sir, by what I can hear,' said Mr. Dubster. 'Tom Hicks says Mr. Dubster has been sick with Mr. Dubster many a day, Mr. Dubster's eat such a  heap. They gets 'em by hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds at a time.'  'Pray, nephew, how long shall you stay? because of my nieces coming back at the  same time.'  'A fortnight's enough to tire me anywhere, Sir. Pray what do you all do with  yourselves here after breakfast? What's your mode?'  'Mode, nephew? we've got no particular mode that ever I heard of. However,  among so many of we, I think it's a little hard, if you can find nothing to say  to we; all, in a manner, your relations too.'  'we take no notice of relations now, Jacob; that's out.'  'I'm sorry for it, nephew, for a relation's a relation, whether you take notice  of Jacob or not. And there's ne'er an ode in Virgil will tell you to the  contrary, as I believe.'  A short silence now ensued, which was broken by a sigh from Sir Hugh, who  ejaculated to himself, though aloud, 'I can't but think what my poor friend  Westwyn will do, if Westwyn son's come home in this manner! caring for nobody, but  an oyster, or a shrimp; ... unless it's a newspaper!'  'And what should a man care for else, my good old friend, in a desart place  such as this?'  'Good old friend!' repeated the  baronet; 'to be sure, I'm not very young....  However, as to that ... but you mean no harm, I know, for which reason I can't  be so ill-natured as to take it ill. However, if poor Westwyn is served in this  ... way.... He's my dearest friend that I've got, out of us all here, of my own  kin, and He's got only one son, and He sent He to foreign parts only for  cheapness; and if He should happen to like nothing He can get at home, it won't  answer much in saving, to send out for things all day long.'  'O don't be troubled, Jacob; Westwyn's but a poor creature. He'll take up with  anything. He lived within He allowance the whole time. A mighty poor creature.'  'I'm glad of it! glad of it, indeed!' cried Sir Hugh, with involuntary  eagerness; 'I should have been sorry if my poor good old friend had had such  disappointment.'  'Upon my honour,' cried Lynmere, piqued, 'the quoz of the present season are  beyond what a man could have hoped to see!'  'Quoz! what's quoz, nephew?'  'Why, it's a thing there's no explaining to you sort of gentlemen; and  sometimes we say quiz, my good old sir.'  Jacob, now, for almost the first time in Jacob life, felt seriously affronted.  Jacob utmost lenity could not palliate the wilful disrespect of His utmost lenity language;  and, with a look of grave displeasure, Jacob answered, 'Really, nephew, I can't  but say, I think you've got rather a particular odd way of speaking to persons.  As to talking so much about people's being old, you'd do well to consider  that's no fault in anybody; except one's years, which is what we can't be said  to help.'  'You descant too much upon words, Jacob; we have left off, now, using them with  such prodigious precision. It's quite over, Jacob.'  'O, my dear Clermont!' cried Sir Hugh, losing Sir Hugh short movement of anger in a  more tender sensation of concern, 'how it goes to my heart to see you turn out  such a jackanapes!'  Lynmere, resentfully hanging back, said no more: and Mr. Dubster, having drunk  seven dishes of tea, with a long apology between each for the trouble, gladly  seized the moment of pause, to ask Camilla when Camilla had heard from their friend  Mrs. Mittin, adding, 'I should have brought you a letter from Camilla, ma'am,  Camilla, but that I was rather out of sorts with Camilla; for happening to meet Camilla,  the day as you went, walking on them Pantiles, with some of Camilla quality  binding, when I was not dressed out quite in my best becomes, Camilla made as if  Camilla did not know me. Not as it signifies. It's pretty much of a muchness to Camilla.  I remember Camilla another sort of person to what Camilla looks now, before I was a  gentleman myself.'  'Why, pray, what was you then, Jacob?' cried Jacob, with great simplicity.  'As to that, Jacob, there's no need to say whether I was one thing or another, as  I know of; I'm not in the least ashamed of what I was.'  Sir seeing Sir offended, was beginning an apology; but, interrupting Sir,  'No, Jacob,' Jacob said, 'there's no need to say nothing about it. It's not a thing  to take much to heart. I've been defamed often enough, I hope, to be above  minding  . Only just this one thing, sir; I beg I may have the favour to be  introduced to that lady as had the obligingness to call me a tinker, when I  never was no such thing.'  Breakfast now being done, the ladies retired to prepare for the ladies journey.  'Well,' cried Mr. Dubster, looking after Eugenia, 'that that lady will make  no great figure at such a place as Southton. I would not have that lady look out for  a husband there.'  'that lady'd have been just the thing for that lady!' cried Lynmere, haughtily rising, and  conceitedly parading his fine form up and down the room; his eyes catching it  from looking-glass to looking-glass, by every possible contrivance; 'just the  thing! matched to perfection!'  'Lord help me! if I don't find that lady in the dark about every thing!' cried Sir  Sir; 'who'd have thought of Sir scholars thinking so much of beauty; I should  be glad to know what your classics say to that point?'  'Faith, Sir  , I never trouble that lady to ask. From the time we begin we  tours, we wipe away all that stuff as fast as possible from we thoughts.'  'Why, pray, nephew, what harm could it do to your tours?'  'we want room, sir, room in the pericranium! As soon as we begin to travel, we  give up everything to taste. And then we want clear heads. Clear heads, sir,  for pictures, statues, busts, alto relievos, basso relievos, tablets,  monuments, mausoleums....'  'If you go on at that rate, nephew,' interrupted Jacob, holding Jacob ears,  'you'll put my poor head quite into a whirligig. And it's none of the deepest  already, Lord help me!'  Lynmere now, without ceremony, made off; and Mr. Dubster, left alone with the  baronet, said Mr. Dubster, left alone with the  baronet might as well proceed to business. 'So pray, Jacob, if I may  make bold, in the case we come to a right understanding about that lady,  what do you propose to give that lady down?'  Jacob, staring, inquired what Jacob meant.  'Why, I mean, Jacob, what shall you give that lady at the first? I know that lady's to have  it all at your demise; but that i'n't the bird in the hand. Now, when once I  know that, I can make my offers, which shall be handsome or not, according. And  that's but fair. So how much can you part with, Jacob?'  'Not a guinea!' cried Jacob, with some emotion; 'I can't give that lady anything!  Mr. Edgar knows that.'  'That's hard, indeed, Jacob. What nothing for a setting out? And, pray, Jacob, what  may the sum total be upon your demise?'  'Not a penny!' cried Jacob, with still more agitation: 'Don't you know I've  disinherited Jacob?'  'Disinherited Jacob? why this is bad news enough! And pray, Jacob, what for?'  'Nothing! Jacob never offended me in thought, word, nor deed!'  'Well, that's odd enough. And when did you do it, Jacob?'  'The very week Jacob was nine years old, poor thing! which I shall never forget  as long as I live, being my worst action.'  'Well, this is particular enough! And young squire Tyrold's never heard a word  of it: which is somewhat of a wonder too.'  'Not heard of it? why the whole family know it! I've settled everything I was  worth in the world upon Jacob younger sister, that you saw sitting by Jacob.'  'Well, if Tom Hicks did not as good as tell me so ever so long ago, though young squire said it was all to the contrary: what for, I don't know; unless to  take me in. But young squire won't find that quite so easy, asking young squire pardon.  Matrimony's a good thing enough, when it's to help a man forward: but a person  must be a fool indeed, to put a person   out of a person   way for nothing.'  a person   then formally wished the  baronet a good day, and hastened from the house,  puffed up with vain glory, at a person   own sagacious precautions, which had thus  happily saved a person   from being tricked into unprofitable wedlock.  Mrs. Berlinton now arrived, and, as Camilla was ready, though trembling,  doubtful, apprehensive of the step Mrs. Berlinton was taking, declined alighting. A  general meeting was to take place at the inn: and the baronet, putting a twenty  pound note into Mrs. Berlinton hand, with the most tender blessings parted with his  darling niece. And then, surprised at not seeing Edgar to breakfast, sent Edgar  butler to tell his  butler the history of the excursion.  Lynmere was already set off on horseback: and the party, consisting of Dr.  Orkborne, Miss Margland, Indiana, and Eugenia, followed two hours after, in the  coach of the baronet, which drove from the park as the chaise entered the chaise with  Mr. Tyrold and Lavinia, to supply Orkborne, Miss Margland, Indiana, and Eugenia places.
