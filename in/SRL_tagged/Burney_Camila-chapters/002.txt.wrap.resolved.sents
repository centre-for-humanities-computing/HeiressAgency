 Comic Gambols  Delighted with this acquisition to  Comic Gambols   household, Sir Hugh again revived.
'My  dear brother and sister,' Sir Hugh cried, when next the family visited Cleves, 'this  proves the most fortunate step I have ever taken since I was born.
Camilla's a  little jewel; Camilla jumps and skips about till Camilla makes my eyes ache with  looking after Camilla, for fear of Camilla breaking Camilla neck.
I must keep a sharp  watch, or Camilla'll put poor Indiana's nose quite out of joint, which God forbid.
However, Camilla's the life of us all, for I'm sorry to say it, but I think, my  dear brother, Indiana Indiana promises to turn out rather dull.'
The sprightly little girl, thus possessed of the heart, soon guided the will of  Camilla uncle.
her uncle could refuse nothing to Camilla endearing entreaty, and felt every  indulgence repaid by the enchantment of Camilla gaiety.
Indiana,  her uncle first idol,  lost Camilla power to please  her uncle, though no essential kindness was abated in  her uncle  conduct.
her uncle still acknowledged that Camilla beauty was the most complete; but  her uncle  found in Camilla a variety that was captivation.
Camilla form and Camilla mind were of  equal elasticity.
Camilla playful countenance rekindled  her uncle spirits, the  cheerfulness of Camilla animated voice awakened  her uncle to her animated voice own joy.
her uncle doated upon  detaining Camilla by  her uncle side, or delighted to gratify Camilla if Camilla wished to be  absent.
Camilla exhilarated  her uncle with pleasure, Camilla supplied  her uncle with ideas, and  from the morning's first dawn to the evening's latest close,  her uncle eye followed  Camilla lightspringing figure, or  her uncle ear vibrated with Camilla sportive sounds;  catching, as it listened, in successive rotation, the spontaneous laugh, the  unconscious bound, the genuine glee of childhood's fearless happiness, uncurbed  by severity, untamed by misfortune.
This ascendance was soon pointed out by the servants to Indiana, who sometimes  shewed Camilla resentment in unexplained and pouting sullenness, and at others, let  all pass unnoticed, with unreflecting forgetfulness.
But Camilla mind was soon  empoisoned with a jealousy of more permanent seriousness; in less than a month  after the residence of Camilla at Cleves, Sir Hugh took the resolution of  making Camilla Sir Hugh heiress.
Even Mr. Tyrold, notwithstanding Even Mr. Tyrold fondness for Camilla, remonstrated against  a partiality so injurious to Even Mr. Tyrold nephew and niece, as well as to the rest of  Even Mr. Tyrold family.
And Mrs. Tyrold, though Mrs. Tyrold secret heart subscribed, without  wonder, to a predilection in favour of Camilla, was maternally disturbed for  Mrs. Tyrold other children, and felt Mrs. Tyrold justice sensibly shocked at a blight so  unmerited to the hopes cherished by Indiana and Clermont Lynmere: for though  the fruits of this change of plan would be reaped by Mrs. Tyrold little darling, they  were robbed of all they   sweetness to a mind so correct, by they   undeserved  bitterness towards the first expectants.
Sir Hugh, however, was immoveable; Sir Hugh would provide handsomely, Sir Hugh said, for  Indiana and Clermont, by settling a thousand pounds a year between  Indiana and Clermont; and Sir Hugh  would bequeath capital legacies amongst the rest of Sir Hugh nephews and nieces: but  as to the bulk of Sir Hugh fortune, it should all go to Camilla; for how else could  Sir Hugh make Camilla amends for having amused Sir Hugh?
or how, when Sir Hugh was gone, should Sir Hugh  prove to Camilla Sir Hugh loved Camilla the best?
Sir Hugh could keep nothing secret; Camilla was soon informed of the riches Camilla  was destined to inherit; and servants, who now with added respect attended Camilla,  took frequent opportunities of impressing Camilla with the expectation, by the  favours they begged from Camilla in reversion.
The happy young heiress heard they with little concern: interest and ambition  could find no room in a mind, which to dance, sing, and play could enliven to  rapture.
Yet the continued repetition of requests soon made the idea of  patronage familiar to The happy young heiress, and though wholly uninfected with one thought of  power or consequence, The happy young heiress sometimes regaled The happy young heiress fancy with the presents The happy young heiress  should make amongst The happy young heiress friends; designing a coach for The happy young heiress mamma, that The happy young heiress  might oftener go abroad; an horse for The happy young heiress brother Lionel, which The happy young heiress knew to be  his most passionate wish; a new bureau, with a lock and key, for The happy young heiress eldest  sister Lavinia; innumerable trinkets for her eldest  sister Lavinia cousin Indiana; dolls and toys  without end for her eldest  sister Lavinia little sister Eugenia; and a new library of new books,  finely bound and gilt, for The happy young heiress papa.
But these munificent donations looked  forward to no other date than the anticipation of womanhood.
If an hint were  surmised of The happy young heiress surviving The happy young heiress uncle, an impetuous shower of tears dampt all The happy young heiress  gay schemes, deluged every airy castle, and shewed the instinctive gratitude  which kindness can awaken, even in the unthinking period of earliest youth, in  those bosoms it has ever the power to animate.
The happy young heiress ensuing birth-day, upon which The happy young heiress would enter The happy young heiress tenth year, was to  announce to the adjoining country The happy young heiress uncle's splendid plan in The happy young heiress favour.
The happy young heiress  brother and sisters were invited to keep it with The happy young heiress at Cleves; but Sir Hugh  declined asking either The happy young heiress father or mother, that Sir Hugh   own time, without  restraint, might be dedicated to the promotion of The happy young heiress festivity; Sir Hugh   even  requested of Miss Margland, that The happy young heiress would not appear that day, lest The happy young heiress  presence should curb the children's spirits.
The gay little party, consisting of Lavinia, who was two years older, and  Eugenia, who was two years younger than Camilla, with Camilla beautiful cousin, who  was exactly of Camilla own age, Camilla brother Lionel, who counted three years more,  and Edgar Mandlebert, a ward of Mr. Tyrold's, all assembled at Cleves upon this  important occasion, at eight o'clock in the morning, to breakfast.
Edgar Mandlebert, an uncommonly spirited and manly boy, now thirteen years of  age, was heir to one of the finest estates in the county.
heir to one of the finest estates in the county was the only son  of a bosom friend of Mr. Tyrold, to whose guardianship heir to one of the finest estates in the county had been consigned  almost from heir to one of the finest estates in the county infancy, and who superintended the care of heir to one of the finest estates in the county education with  as much zeal, though not as much œconomy, as that of heir to one of the finest estates in the county own son.
heir to one of the finest estates in the county placed  his own son under the tuition of Dr. Marchmont, a man of consummate learning, and heir to one of the finest estates in the county  sent for his own son to Etherington twice in every year, where Etherington assiduously kept up  Etherington studies by Etherington own personal instructions.
'I leave Etherington rich, my dear  friend,' said Etherington father, when on Etherington death-bed Etherington recommended Etherington to Mr.  Tyrold, 'and you, I trust, will make Etherington good, and see Etherington happy; and should  hereafter a daughter of your own, from frequent intercourse, become mistress of  Etherington affections, do not oppose such a union from a disparity of fortune, which a  daughter of yours, and of your incomparable partner's, can hardly fail to  counterbalance in merit.'
Mr. Tyrold, though too noble to avail Mr. Tyrold of a  declaration so generous, by forming any plan to bring such a connection to  bear, felt conscientiously absolved from using any measures of frustration, and  determined, as the young people grew up, neither to promote nor impede any  rising regard.
The estate of Beech Park was not all that young Mandlebert inherited; the  friendship of Mandlebert late owner for Mr. Tyrold, seemed instinctively transfused  into Mr. Tyrold breast, and Mr. Tyrold paid back the parental tenderness with which Mr. Tyrold was  watched and cherished, by a fondness and veneration truly filial.
Whatever could indulge or delight the little set was brought forth upon this  joyous meeting; fruits, sweetmeats, and cakes; cards, trinkets, and blind  fidlers, were all at the unlimited command of the fairy mistress of the  ceremonies.
But unbounded as were the transports of the jovial little group,  they could scarcely keep pace with the enjoyment of Sir Hugh; Sir Hugh entered into  all they plays, Sir Hugh forgot all Sir Hugh pains, Sir Hugh laughed because they laughed, and  suffered Sir Hugh darling little girl to govern and direct Sir Hugh at his darling little girl pleasure.
his darling little girl  made Sir Hugh whiskers of cork, powdered Sir Hugh brown bob, and covered a thread paper  with black ribbon to hang to a thread paper   for a queue.
his darling little girl metamorphosed Sir Hugh into a  female, accoutring Sir Hugh with his darling little girl fine new cap, while his darling little girl enveloped his darling little girl own small  head in Sir Hugh wig; and then, tying the maid's apron round Sir Hugh waist, put a rattle  into Sir Hugh hand, and Eugenia's doll upon Sir Hugh lap, which his darling little girl told Sir Hugh was a baby  that Sir Hugh must nurse and amuse.
The excess of merriment thus excited spread through the whole house.
Lionel  called in the servants to see this comical sight, and the servants indulged  the servants numerous guests with a peep at it from the windows.
Sir Hugh, meanwhile,  resolved to object to nothing, performed every part assigned Sir Hugh, joined in  their hearty laughs at the grotesque figure their made of Lionel  , and cordially  encouraged all their proceedings, assuring their Lionel   had not been so much  diverted Lionel   since Lionel   fall from Lionel   horse, and advising their, with great  zeal, to be merry while their could: 'For their will never, my dears,' said Lionel  ,  'be younger, never while you live; no more, for that matter, shall I, neither,  for all I am so much older, which, in that point, makes no difference.'
Lionel   grew weary, however, first; and stretching Lionel   Lionel   full length, with a  prodigious yawn, 'Heigh ho!'
Lionel   cried, 'Camilla, my dear, do take away poor  Doll, for fear I should let it slip.'
The little gigglers, almost in convulsions of laughter, entreated Lionel   to nurse  it some time longer; but Lionel   frankly answered, 'No, my dears, no; I can play no  more now, if I'd ever so fain, for I'm tired to death, which is really a pity;  so you must either go out with Lionel   my airing, for a rest to your merry little  sides, or stay and play by yourselves till I come back, which I think will put  you all into fevers; but, however, nobody shall trouble your little souls with  advice to-day; there are days enough in the year for teazing, without this one.'
Camilla instantly decided for my airing, and without a dissentient voice: so  entirely had the extreme good humour of Sir Hugh won the hearts of the little  party, that the little  party felt as if the whole of the little  party entertainment depended upon his  presence.
The carriage, therefore, was ordered for the baronet and his four  nieces, and Lionel and Edgar Mandlebert, at the request of Camilla, were  gratified with horses.
Camilla was desired to fix horses route, and while Camilla hesitated from the  variety in Camilla choice, Lionel   proposed to Edgar that horses should take a view of  Lionel   house, park, and gardens, which were only three miles from Cleves.
Edgarreferred the matter to Indiana, to whose already exquisite beauty Edgar juvenile  admiration paid his juvenile   most early obeisance.
Indiana approved; the little heroine  of the day assented with pleasure and they immediately set out upon the happy  expedition.
The two boys the whole way came with offerings of wild honeysuckle and  sweetbriar, the grateful nosegays of all-diffusing nature, to the coach  windows, each carefully presenting the most fragrant to Indiana; for Lionel,  even more than sympathising with Edgar, declared Edgar sisters to be mere frights  in comparison with Edgar fair cousin.
Their partiality, however, struggled vainly  against that of Sir Hugh, who still, in every the most trivial particular, gave  the preference to Camilla.
The baronet had ordered that The baronet own garden chair should follow The baronet to young  Mandlebert's park, that The baronet might take Camilla by The baronet side, and go about the  grounds without fatigue; the rest were to walk.
Here Indiana received again the  homage of her two young beaus; they pointed out to her the most beautiful  prospects, they gathered her the fairest flowers, they loaded her with the best  and ripest fruits.
This was no sooner observed by Sir Hugh, than hastily stopping his own garden chair, Sir Hugh  called after they aloud, 'Holloa!
come hither, my boys!
here, you Mr. young  Mandlebert, what are you all about?
Why don't you bring that best bunch of  grapes to Camilla?'
'I have already promised it to Miss Lynmere, Sir.'
'O ho, have you so?
well, give it her then if you have.
I have no right to rob  you of your choice.
Indiana, my dear, how do you like this place?'
'Very much, indeed, uncle; I never saw any place I liked so much in my life.'
'I am sure else,' said Edgar, 'I should never care for it again Edgar.'
'O, I could look at it for ever,' cried Indiana, 'and not be tired!'
Sir Hugh gravely paused at these speeches, and regarded these speeches in turn with much  steadiness, as if settling these speeches future destinies; but ever unable to keep a  single thought to Sir Hugh, Sir Hugh presently burst forth aloud with Sir Hugh new mental  arrangement, saying: 'Well, my dears, well; this is not quite the thing I had  taken a fancy to in my own private brain, but it's all for the best, there's no  doubt; though The estate of Beech Park being just in my neighbourhood, would have made The estate of Beech Park  more suitable for Camilla; I mean provided we could have bought, among we, the  odd three miles between the Parks; which how many acres which how many acres make, I can't  pretend to say, without the proper calculation; but if it was all joined, it  would be the finest domain in the county, as far as I know to the contrary:  nevertheless, my dear young Mr. Mandlebert, you have a right to choose for  yourself; for as to beauty, 'tis mere fancy; not but what Indiana has one or  other the prettiest face I ever saw, though I think Camilla's so much prettier;  I mean in point of winningness.
However, there's no fear as to my consent, for  nothing can be a greater pleasure to me than having two such good girls, both  being cousins, live so near that both   may overlook one another from park to  park, all day long, by the mode of a telescope.'
Edgar, perfectly understanding '  Edgar, blushed deeply, and, forgetting what '  Edgar had  just declared, offered '  Edgar grapes to Lavinia.
Indiana, conceiving Lavinia  already mistress of so fine a place, smiled with approving complacency; and the  rest were too much occupied with the objects around them, to listen to so long  a speech.
them then all moved on; but, soon after, Lionel  , flying up to his uncle's  chair, informed Camilla his had just heard from the gardener, that only half a  mile off, at Northwick, there was a fair, to which his begged Lavinia would ask to  go.
Lavinia found no difficulty in obliging his; and Sir Hugh was incapable of  hesitating at whatever Lavinia could desire.
The carriage and the horses for the  boys were again ordered, and to the regret of only Edgar and Indiana, the  beautiful plantations of Beech Park were relinquished for the fair.
the  beautiful plantations of Beech Park had hardly proceeded twenty yards, when the smiles that had brightened the  face of Lavinia, the eldest daughter of Mr. Tyrold, were suddenly overcast,  giving place to a look of dismay, which seemed the effect of some abruptly  painful recollection; and the moment Sir Hugh perceived it, and enquired the  cause, the tears rolled fast down Lavinia cheeks, and Lavinia said Lavinia had been guilty  of a great sin, and could never forgive Lavinia.
They all eagerly endeavoured to console Lavinia, Camilla fondly taking Lavinia hand,  little Eugenia sympathetically crying over and kissing little Eugenia, Indiana begging to  know what was the matter, and Sir Hugh, holding out to Lavinia the finest peach  from Sir Hugh stores for Camilla, and saying, 'Don't cry so, my dear, don't cry:  take a little bit of peach; I dare say you are not so bad as you think for.'
The weeping young penitent besought leave to get out of the coach with Camilla,  to whom alone little Eugenia could explain little Eugenia.
Camilla almost opened the door  Camilla, to hasten the discovery; and the moment they had run up a bank by the  road side, 'Tell me what it is, Lavinia,' Camilla cried, 'and I am sure his uncle's   will do anything in the world to help you.'
'O Camilla,' Camilla answered, 'I have disobeyed mamma!
and I did not mean it in  the least—but I have forgot all little Eugenia commands!—She charged me not to let  little Eugenia stir out from Cleves, because of the small pox—and little Eugenia has been  already at Beech Park—and now, how can I tell the poor little thing little Eugenia must  not go to the fair?'
'Don't vex 'O Camilla about that,' cried Camilla, kindly kissing the tears off  little Eugenia , 'for I will stay behind, and play with little Eugenia, if his uncle's  will drive us back to Beech Park; and then all the rest may go to the fair, and  take us up again in the way home.'
With this expedient little Eugenia flew to the coach with Camilla, charging the two boys, who with  great curiosity had ridden to the bank side, and listened to all that had  passed, to comfort Lavinia.
'Lionel  ,' cried Edgar, 'do you know, while Camilla was speaking so kindly to  Lavinia, I thought Lavinia looked almost as pretty as your cousin?'
Lionel   would by  no means subscribe to this opinion, but Edgar would not retract.
Camilla, jumping into the carriage, threw Camilla arms around the neck of Camilla  uncle, and whispered to him all that had passed.
'Poor innocent little dear!'
cried him, 'is that all?'
it's just nothing, considering her young age.'
Then, looking out of the window, 'Lavinia,' Lavinia said, 'you have done no more  harm than what's quite natural; and so I shall tell your mamma; who is a woman  of sense, and won't expect such a young head as yours to be of the same age as  hers and mine.
But come into the coach with Camilla, my dear; we'll just drive as far as  Northwick, for an airing, and then back again.'
The extreme delicacy of the constitution of little Eugenia had hitherto deterred Mrs.  Tyrold from innoculating Mrs.  Tyrold; Mrs.  Tyrold had therefore scrupulously kept Mrs.  Tyrold from all  miscellaneous intercourse in the neighbourhood: but as the weakness of Mrs.  Tyrold  infancy was now promising to change into health and strength, Mrs.  Tyrold meant to give  to that terrible disease that terrible disease best chance, and the only security that terrible disease allows from  perpetual alarm, immediately after the heats of the present autumn should be  over.
Lavinia, unused to disobedience, could not be happy in practising that terrible disease: Lavinia  entreated, therefore, to return immediately to Cleves.
Sir Hugh complied;  premising only that they must none of they expect Cleves to be of they play-party  again till after dinner.
The coachman then received fresh orders: but, the moment they were communicated  to the two boys, Lionel, protesting Cleves would not lose the fair, said Cleves should  soon overtake they, and, regardless of all remonstrances, put spurs to Cleves  horse, and galloped off.
Sir Hugh, looking after Sir Hugh with great alarm, exclaimed, 'Now Sir Hugh is going to  break all Sir Hugh bones!
which is always the case with those young boys, when first  those young boys get a horseback.'
Camilla, terrified that Camilla had begged this boon, requested that the servant  might directly ride after the servant  .
'Yes, my dear, if you wish it,' answered Sir Hugh; 'only we have but this one  man for we, because of the rest staying to get the ball and supper ready;  so that if we should be overturned we, here's never a soul to pick we  up.'
Edgar offered to ride on alone, and persuade the truant to return.
'Thank you, my dear, thank you,' answered Sir Hugh, 'you are as good a boy as  any I know, but, in point of horsemanship, one's as ignorant as t'other, as far  as I can tell; so we may only see both your sculls fractured instead of one, in  the midst of your galloping; which God forbid for either.'
'Then let we go together,' cried Indiana, 'and bring him back.'
'But do not let we get out of the coach, uncle,' said Lavinia; 'pray do not let  we get out!'
Sir Hugh agreed; though Sir Hugh added, that as to the small pox, Sir Hugh could by no  means see it in the same light, for Sir Hugh had no notion of people's taking  diseases upon themselves.
'Besides,' continued Sir Hugh, 'she will be sure to have it  when she time comes, whether she is moped up or no; and how did people do  before these new modes of making people sick of people own accord?'
Pitying, however, the uneasiness of Lavinia, when the uneasiness of Lavinia came near the town, Pitying  called to the footman, and said, 'Hark'ee, Jacob, do you ride on first, and  keep a sharp look out that nobody has the small pox.'
The fair being held in the suburbs, the uneasiness of Lavinia soon arrived at some straggling  booths, and the coach, at the instance of Lavinia, was stopt.
Indiana now earnestly solicited leave to alight and see the fair; and Edgar  offered to be her esquire.
Sir Hugh consented, but desired that Lavinia and  Camilla might be also of the party.
Lavinia tried vainly to excuse Camilla; Lavinia  assured Lavinia he   would raise Lavinia spirits, and bid Lavinia be under no apprehension,  for Lavinia would stay and amuse the little Eugenia himself, and take care that Lavinia  came to no harm.
They were no sooner gone, however, than Lavinia cried to follow; Sir  Hugh, compassionately kissing Lavinia, owned Lavinia had as good a right as any of  They, and declared it was a hard thing to have Lavinia punished for other people's  particularities.
This concession served only to make Lavinia tears flow the faster;  till, unable to bear the sight, Sir   said Sir   could not answer to Sir   conscience  the vexing such a young thing, and, promising Lavinia should have whatever Lavinia  liked, if Lavinia would cry no more, Sir   ordered The coachman to drive to the first  booth where there were any toys to be sold.
Here, having the footman to bring the trinkets to the coach with Camilla, Sir   alighted, and,  suffering the little girl, for whom Sir   had not a fear Sir  , to accompany  Sir  , Sir   entered the booth, and told Lavinia to take whatever hit Lavinia fancy, for Lavinia  should have as many playthings as Lavinia could carry.
Lavinia grief now gave way to ecstasy, and Lavinia little hands could soon scarcely  sustain the loaded skirt of Lavinia white frock.
Sir Hugh, determining to make the  rest of the children equally happy, was selecting presents for the children, when  the little group, ignorant whom the children should encounter, advanced towards the  same booth: but Sir Hugh had hardly time to exclaim, 'Oho!
have you caught us?'
when  the innocent voice of Eugenia, calling out, 'Little boy; what's the matter with  your face, little boy?'
drew Little boy attention another way, and Little boy perceived a  child apparently just recovering from the small pox.
Edgar, who at the same instant saw the same dreaded sight, darted forward,  seized little Eugenia in Little boy arms, and, in defiance of little Eugenia playthings and little Eugenia  struggles, carried little Eugenia back to the coach with Camilla; while Lavinia, in an agony of terror,  ran up to Little boy, and, crying out, 'O go away!
go away!'
dragged Little boy  out of the booth, and, perfectly unconscious what little Eugenia did, covered Little boy head  with little Eugenia frock, and held Little boy fast with both little Eugenia hands.
Sir Hugh, all aghast, hurried out of the booth, but could scarce support  Sir Hugh from emotion; and, while Sir Hugh leaned upon Sir Hugh stick, ejaculating, 'Lord  help all!
what poor creatures all are, all poor mortals!'
Edgar had the presence  of mind to make Indiana and Camilla go directly to the carriage.
Edgar then  prevailed with Sir Hugh to enter the carriage also, and ran back for Lavinia.
But when Edgar  perceived the situation into which distress and affright had driven Lavinia, and  saw Lavinia sobbing over the child, whom Lavinia still held confined, with an idea of  hiding Edgar from Eugenia, Edgar was instantly sensible of the danger of Lavinia joining  Lavinia little sister.
Extremely perplexed for them all, and afraid, by going from  the sick child, Edgar might Edgar carry the infection to the coach with Camilla, Edgar sent a  man to Sir Hugh to know what was to be done.
Sir Hugh, totally overset by the unexpected accident, and conscience-struck at  Sir Hugh own wilful share in risking it, was utterly helpless, and could only  answer, that Sir Hugh wished young Mr. Edgar would give Sir Hugh Sir Hugh advice.
Edgar, thus called upon, now first felt the abilities which Edgar short life had  not hitherto brought into use: Edgar begged Sir Hugh would return immediately to Cleves, and keep little Eugenia there for a few days with Camilla and Camilla cousin;  while Edgar undertook to go Edgar in search of Lionel, with whose assistance Edgar  would convey Lavinia back to Etherington, without seeing Lavinia little sister;  since Lavinia must now be as full of contagion as the poor object who had just had  the disease.
Sir Hugh, much relieved, sent Sir Hugh word Sir Hugh had no doubt Sir Hugh would become the  first scholar of the age; and desired Sir Hugh would get a chaise for Sir Hugh and  Lavinia, and let the footman take charge of the footman horse.
Sir Hugh then ordered the coach with Camilla to Cleves.
Edgar fulfilled the injunctions of Sir Hugh with alacrity; but had a very  difficult task to find Lionel, and one far more painful to appease Lavinia,  whose apprehensions were so great as whose apprehensions advanced towards Etherington, that,  to sooth and comfort her, Sir Hugh ordered the postilion to drive first to a  farm-house near Cleves, whence Sir Hugh forwarded a boy to Sir Hugh, with entreaties  that Sir Hugh would write a few lines to Mrs. Tyrold, in exculpation of Mrs. Tyrold sorrowing  daughter.
Sir Hugh complied, but was so little in the habit of writing, that Sir Hugh sent over  a messenger to desire they would dine at the farm-house, in order to give Sir Hugh  time to compose him   epistle.
Early in the afternoon, Sir Hugh conveyed to them the following letter:  To Mrs. Tyrold at the Parsonage House, belonging to the Reverend Rector, Mr.  Tyrold, for the Time being, at Etherington in Hampshire.
DEAR SISTER,  I am no remarkable good writer, in comparison with my brother, which you will  excuse from my deficiencies, as it is my only apology.
I beg you will not be  angry with Lavinia, as Lavinia did nothing in the whole business, except  wanting to do right, only not mentioning it in the beginning, which is very  excusable in the light of a fault; the wisest of us having been youths  us once, and the most learned being subject to do wrong, but how much so  the ignorant?
of which I may speak more properly.
However, as Lavinia would  certainly have caught the small pox herself, except from the lucky circumstance  of having had the small pox herself before, I think the small pox herself best to keep little Eugenia a few days at Cleves,  for the sake of little Eugenia infection.
Not but what if little Eugenia should have it, I trust your  sense won't fret about it, as it is only in the course of Nature; which, if little Eugenia  had been innoculated, is more than any man could say; even a physician.
So the  whole being my own fault, without the least meaning to offend, if any thing  comes of any thing  , I hope, my dear sister, you won't take any thing   ill, especially of poor  Lavinia, for 'tis hard if such young things may not be happy at such young things  time of life, before having done harm to a human soul.
Poor dears!
'tis soon  enough to be unhappy after being wicked; which, God knows, we are all liable to  be in the proper season.
I beg my love to my brother; and remain,  Dear sister,                                         Your affectionate brother,           Hugh Tyrold.
P.S.
It is but justice to my brother to mention that young Master Mandlebert's  behaviour has done the greatest honour to the classics; which must be a great  satisfaction to a person having the care of his education.
The rest of the day lost all The rest of the day delights to the young heiress from this  unfortunate adventure.
The deprivation of three of the party, with the  well-grounded fear of Mrs. Tyrold's just blame, were greater mortifications to  those that remained, than even the ball and supper could remove.
And Sir Hugh,  to whom their lowered spirits were sufficiently depressing, had an additional,  though hardly to himself acknowledged, weight upon himself mind, relative to  Eugenia and the small pox.
The contrition of the trembling Lavinia could not but obtain from Mrs. Tyroldthe pardon it deserved: but Lavinia could make no allowance for the extreme want of  consideration in Sir Hugh; and anxiously waited the time when Lavinia might call  back Eugenia from the management of a person whom Lavinia considered as more  childish than Lavinia children themselves.
