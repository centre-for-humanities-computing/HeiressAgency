 Two Ways of looking at the same Thing  When the party arrived at Cleves, Camilla, who had observed that Edgar seemed  much disappointed by the breaking up of the cottage expedition, proposed that  it should take place in the evening; and her uncle, though too much fatigued to  venture out again himself, consented, or rather insisted, that the excursion  should be made without him.  Before they set out, Edgar desired to speak with Sir Hugh in private.  Sir Hugh concluded it was to make his proposals of marriage for Indiana; and  had not patience to step into his own apartment, but told them all to retire,  with a nod at Indiana, which prepared not only herself but Miss Margland,  Camilla, and Eugenia to join in his expectation.  Indiana, though a good deal fluttered, flew to a window, to see if the new  chariot was in sight; and then, turning to Miss Margland, asked, 'Pray, should  I refuse him at first?'  Miss Margland spared not for proper instructions; and immediately began a  negociation with the fair questioner, for continuing to live with her.  Eugenia was occupied in reflecting with pity upon the idleness of Indiana,  which so ill had fitted her for becoming the companion of Mandlebert.  Camilla, unusually thoughtful, walked alone into the garden, and sought a path  least in sight.  Sir Hugh, meanwhile, was most unpleasantly undeceived. Edgar, without naming  Indiana, informed him of the situation in which he had surprised Bellamy, and  of his suspicions with regard to the destination of the chaise, but for his own  timely arrival at the farm-house; adding, that his gratitude to Mr. Tyrold, his  respect for himself, and his affection for all the family, made him think it is  duty to reveal these circumstances without delay.  The baronet shuddered with horror; and declared he would instantly send an  express to bring Clermont home, that Eugenia might be married out of hand; and,  in the mean time, that he would have every window in the house barred, and keep  her locked up in her room.  Edgar dissuaded him from so violent a measure; but advised him to speak with  his niece upon the danger she had probably escaped, and of which she seemed  wholly unconscious; to prevail with her not to go out again this evening, and  to send for Mr. Tyrold, and acquaint him with the affair.  Sir Hugh thanked him for his counsel, and implicitly acted by his opinion.  He then ordered the coach for Miss Margland, Indiana, and Camilla.  Dr. Orkborne, finding neither Sir Hugh nor Eugenia of the party, declined  joining it. Lionel was returned to Etherington; and Edgar rode on before, to  invite Dr. Marchmont, with the consent of the Baronet, to take the fourth place  in the carriage.  Arrived at the rectory, he went straight, by prescriptive privilege, into the  study of Dr. Marchmont, whom he found immersed in books and papers, which,  immediately, at the request of Edgar, he put aside; not without regret to quit  them, though wholly without reluctance to oblige.  Edgar had ridden so hard, that they had some time to wait for the coach. But he  did not appear anxious for its arrival; though he wore a look that was far from  implying him to be free from anxiety.  He was silent,—he hemmed,—he was silent again,—and again he hemmed,—and  then, gently laying his hand upon the shoulder of the Doctor, while his eyes,  full of meaning, were fixed upon his face; 'Doctor,' he cried, 'you would  hardly have known these young ladies?—they are all grown from children into  women since you saw them last.'  'Yes,' answered the Doctor, 'and very charming women. Indiana has a beauty so  exquisite, it is scarce possible to look away from it a moment: Eugenia joins  so much innocence with information, that the mind must itself be deformed that  could dwell upon her personal defects, after conversing with her: Camilla'—  He paused, and Edgar hastily turned another way, not to look at him, nor be  looked at, while he proceeded:  'Camilla,' he presently continued, 'seems the most inartificially sweet, the  most unobtrusively gay, and the most attractively lovely of almost any young  creature I ever beheld.'  With a heart all expanded, and a face full of sensibility, Edgar now turned to  him, and seizing, involuntarily, his hand, which he eagerly shook, 'You think  her, then,'—he cried,—but suddenly stopt, dropt his hand, coughed two or  three times; and, taking out his pocket handkerchief, seemed tormented with a  violent cold.  Dr. Marchmont affectionately embraced him. 'My dear young young friend,' he  cried, 'I see the situation of your mind—and think every possible happiness  promises to be yours; yet, if you have taken no positive step, suffer me to  speak with you before you proceed.'  'Far from having taken any positive step, I have not yet even formed any  resolution.'  Here the carriage stopt for the Doctor, who repeated, 'Yes! I think every  possible happiness promises to be yours!' before he went on to the ladies.  Edgar, in a trepidation too great to be seen by them, kept behind till they  drove off, though he then galloped so fast, that he arrived at the cottage  before them: the words, 'I think every possible happiness promises to be  yours,' vibrating the whole time in his ears.  When the coach arrived, Edgar handed out Miss Margland and Indiana; leaving  Camilla to the Doctor; willing to let him see more of her, and by no means  displeased to avoid his eyes at that moment himself.  Indiana was in the most sprightly spirits she had ever experienced; she  concluded herself on the verge of becoming mistress of a fine place and a large  fortune; she had received adulation all the morning that had raised her beauty  higher than ever in her own estimation; and she secretly revolved, with  delight, various articles of ornament and of luxury, which she had long wished  to possess, and which now, for her wedding clothes, she should have riches  sufficient to purchase.  Miss Margland, too, was all smoothness, complacency, and courtesy.  Camilla, alone, was grave; Camilla, who, by nature, was gay.  'Dear! is this the cottage we have been coming to all this time?' cried  Indiana, upon entering; 'Lord! I thought it would have been something quite  pretty.'  'And what sort of prettiness,' said Edgar, 'did you expect from a cottage?'  'Dear, I don't know—but I thought we were come on purpose to see something  extraordinary?'  Camilla, who followed, made an exclamation far different; an exclamation of  pleasure, surprise, and vivacity, that restored for an instant, all her native  gaiety: for no sooner had she crossed the threshold, than she recognised, in a  woman who was curtsying low to receive her, and whom Indiana had passed without  observing, the wife of the poor prisoner for whom she had interceded with  Mandlebert.  'How I rejoice to see you!' cried she, 'and to see you here! and how much  better you look! and how comfortable you seem! I hope you are now all well?'  'Ah, madam,' answered the woman; 'we owe everything to that good young  gentleman! he has put us in this nice new cottage, and employs us in his  service. Blessings on his head! I am sure he will be paid for it!'  Edgar, somewhat agitated, occupied himself with jumping the little boy; Camilla  looked round with rapture; Indiana seemed wonder-struck, without knowing why;  Dr. Marchmont narrowly watched them all; and Miss Margland, expecting a new  collection would be next proposed for setting them up, nimbly re-crossed the  threshold, to examine the prospect without.  The husband, now in decent garb, and much recovered, though still weak and  emaciated, advanced to Camilla, to make his humble acknowledgments, that she  had recommended them to their kind benefactor.  'No!' cried Camilla; 'you owe me nothing! your own distress recommended  you;—your own distress—and Mr. Mandlebert's generosity.'  Then, going up to Edgar, 'It is your happy fate,' she said, in an accent of  admiration, 'to act all that my father so often plans and wishes, but which his  income will not allow him to execute.'  'You see,' answered he, gratefully, 'how little suffices for content! I have  scarce done anything—yet how relieved, how satisfied are these poor people!  This hut was fortunately vacant'—  'O, madam!' interrupted the poor woman, 'if you knew but how that good  gentleman has done it all! how kindly he has used us, and made everybody else  use us! and let nobody taunt us with our bad faults!—and what good he has  done to my poor sick husband! and how he has clothed my poor little half naked  children! and, what is more than all, saved us from the shame of an ill  life.'—  Camilla felt the tears start into her eyes;—she hastily snatched the little  babe into her arms; and, while her kisses hid her face, Happy, and thrice happy  Indiana! with a soft sigh, was the silent ejaculation of her heart.  She seated herself on a stool, and, without speaking or hearing any thing more,  devoted herself to the baby.  Indiana, meanwhile, whose confidence in her own situation gave her courage to  utter whatever first occurred to her, having made a general survey of the place  and people, with an air of disappointment, now amused herself with an  inspection more minute, taking up and casting down everything that was  portable, without any regard either to deranging its neatness, or endangering  its safety:—exclaiming, as she made her round of investigation, 'Dear!  Crockery ware! how ugly!—Lord, what little mean chairs!—Is that your best  gown, good woman?—Dear, what an ugly pattern!—Well, I would not wear such a  thing to save my life!—Have you got nothing better than this for a  floor-cloth?—Only look at those curtains! Did you ever see such  frights?—Lord! do you eat off these platters? I am sure I could sooner die! I  should not mind starving half as much!'  Miss Margland, hoping the collection was now either made or relinquished,  ventured to re-enter, and inquire if they never meant to return home? Camilla  unwillingly gave up the baby; but would not depart without looking over the  cottage, where everything she saw excited a sensation of pleasure. 'How neat is  this! How tidy that!' were her continual exclamations; 'How bright you have  rubbed your saucepans! How clean every thing is all round! How soon you will  all get well in this healthy and comfortable little dwelling!'  Edgar, in a low voice, then told Dr. Marchmont the history of his new  cottagers, saying: 'You will not, I hope, disapprove what I have done? Their  natures seemed so much disposed to good, I could not bear to let their wants  turn them again to evil.'  'You have certainly done right,' answered the Doctor; 'to give money without  inquiry, or further aid, to those who have adopted bad practices, is, to them,  but temptation, and to society an injury; but to give them both the counsel and  the means to pursue a right course, is, to them, perhaps, salvation, and to the  community, the greatest service.'  Indiana and Miss Margland, quite wearied, both got into the carriage; Edgar,  having deposited them, returned to Camilla, who kissed both the children,  poured forth good wishes upon the father and mother; and, then, gave him her  hand. Enchanted, he took it, exclaiming; 'Ah! who is like you! so lively—yet  so feeling!'  Struck and penetrated, she made no answer: Alas! she thought, I fear he is not  quite satisfied with Indiana!  Dr. Marchmont was set down at his own house; where, he begged to have a  conference with Edgar the next morning.  The whole way home, the benevolence of Edgar occupied the mind of Camilla; and,  not in the present instance, the less, that its object had been originally of  her own pointing out.
