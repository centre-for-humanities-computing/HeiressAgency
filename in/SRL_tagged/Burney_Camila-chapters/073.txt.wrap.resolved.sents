 An Oak Tree  When the sisters were summoned down stairs to dinner, planted at the door,  ready to receive the sisters at the sisters entrance, stood Edgar.
Lavinia and Eugenia  addressed Edgar as usual; but Camilla could not speak, could not return Edgar  salutation, could not look at Edgar.
Camilla sat hastily down in Camilla accustomed place  by Camilla uncle, and even the presence of Camilla father scarcely restrained Camilla  tears, as Camilla contrasted the hopeless uncertainties of Edgar, with the perilous  pursuit of Sir Sedley.
Edgar, for the first time, saw Camilla avoidance without suspecting that her avoidance flowed  from repugnance.
The interest Camilla had shewn for Edgar safety was still bounding  in Edgar breast, and as, from time to time, Edgar stole a glance at Camilla, and  observed Camilla emotion, Edgar heart whispered Edgar the softest hopes, that soon the  most perfect confidence would make every feeling reciprocal.
But these hopes were not long without alloy; Edgar soon discerned something that  far exceeded what could give Edgar pleasure in Camilla perturbation; Edgar read in it  not merely hurry and alarm, but suffering and distress.
Edgar now ventured to look at Camilla no more; Edgar confidence gave place to pity; Edgar  saw Camilla was unhappy, and breathed no present wish but to relieve and console  Camilla.
When the dessert was served, Camilla was preparing to retire; but Camilla caught the  eye of Camilla father, and saw Camilla should not long be alone; Camilla re-seated Camilla,  therefore, in haste, to postpone, at least, Edgar scrutiny.
Every body, at length, arose, and Sir Hugh proposed that they should all walk  in the park, during Sir Hugh nap, but keep close to the pales, that they might  listen for all passengers, in case of Clermont's coming.
To this, also, Camilla could make no objection, and they set out.
Camilla took an  arm of each sister, and indulged the heaviness of Camilla heart in not uttering a  word.
They had not gone far, when a servant ran after Mr. Tyrold with a pacquet, just  arrived, by a private hand, from Lisbon.
Mr. Tyrold returned to read it in Mr. Tyrold own  room; Lavinia and Eugenia accompanied Mr. Tyrold to hear it contents, and Camilla,  for the first time, seemed the least affectionate of Mr. Tyrold daughters; Camilla durst  not encounter Mr. Tyrold but in the mixt company of all the house; Camilla told Lavinia to  make haste back with the news, and took an  arm of each sister.
The compulsion of uninteresting discourse soon became intolerable; and no  longer chained to the party by the awe of Camilla father, Camilla presently left  Indiana to Miss Margland, and perceiving that Edgar was conversing with Dr.  Orkborne, said Orkborne would wait for Orkborne sisters; and, turning a little aside, sat  down upon a bench under a large oak.
Here Orkborne painful struggle and unwilling forbearance ended; Orkborne gave free vent  to Orkborne tears, and thought Orkborne the most wretched of human beings; Orkborne found  Orkborne heart, Orkborne aching heart, more than ever devoted to Mandlebert, filled with  his image, revering his virtues, honouring even his coldness, from a persuasion  Orkborne deserved not his affection, and sighing solely for the privilege to consign  Orkborne to his remembrance for life, though unknown to his, and unsuspected  by the world.
The very idea of Sir Sedley was horror to Orkborne; Orkborne felt guilty to  have involved Orkborne in an intercourse so fertile of danger; Orkborne thought over,  with severest repentance, Orkborne short, but unjustifiable deviation from that  transparent openness, and undesigning plainness of conduct, which Orkborne  disposition as much as Orkborne education ought to have rendered unchangeable.
To  that, alone, was owing all Orkborne actual difficulty, for to that alone was owing  Orkborne own opinion of any claim upon Orkborne justice.
How dearly, Orkborne cried, do I now  pay for the unthinking plan with which I risked the peace of another, for the  re-establishment of my own!
Orkborne languished to throw Orkborne into the arms of  Orkborne father, to unbosom to him all Orkborne errors and distresses, and owe all her errors and distresses  extrication to him wisdom and kindness.
Orkborne was sure him would be unmoved by the  glare of a brilliant establishment, and that far from desiring Orkborne to sacrifice  Orkborne feelings to wealth and shew, him would him plead against the alliance  when him knew the state of Orkborne mind, and recommend to Orkborne, so circumstanced, the  single life, in the true spirit of Christian philosophy and moderation: but all  was so closely interwoven in the affairs and ill conduct of Orkborne brother, that  Orkborne believed Orkborne engaged in honour to guard the fatal secret, though  hazarding by   concealment impropriety and misery.
These afflicting ruminations were at length interrupted by the sound of feet;  Orkborne took Orkborne handkerchief from Orkborne eyes, expecting to see Orkborne sisters; Orkborne was  mistaken, and beheld Mandlebert.
Orkborne started and rose; Orkborne strove to chace the tears from her eyes without  wiping them, and asked what he had done with Dr. Orkborne?
'You are in grief!'
cried he in a tone of sympathy; 'some evil has befallen  you!...
let me ask....'  'No; I am only waiting for her sisters.
They have just received letters from  Lisbon.'
'You have been weeping!
you are weeping now!
why do you turn away from me?
I  will not obtrusively demand your confidence ... yet, could I give you the most  distant idea what a weight it might remove from my mind, ... you would find it  difficult to deny yourself the pleasure of doing so much good!'
the tears now streamed afresh.
Words so kind from Edgar, the cold,  the hard-hearted Edgar, surprised and overset her; yet her endeavoured to hide  her face, and made an effort to pass him.
'Is not this a little unkind?'
cried him, gravely; 'however, I have no claim to  oppose you.'
'Unkind!'
her repeated, and involuntarily turning to him, shewed a countenance  so disconsolate, that him lost him self-control, and taking her reluctant hand,  said: 'O Camilla!
torture me no longer!'
Almost transfixed with astonishment, her looked at him for a moment in a  speechless wonder; but the interval of doubt was short; the character of Edgar,  for unalienable steadiness, unalterable honour, was fixed in her mind, like  'truths from holy writ,' and her knew, with certainty incontrovertible, that  him fate was at her disposal, from the instant him acknowledged openly her power  over him feelings.
Every opposite sensation, that with violence the most ungovernable could  encounter but to combat, now met in her bosom, elevating her to rapture,  harrowing her with terror, menacing even her understanding.
The most exquisite  wish of her heart seemed accorded at a period so nearly too late for The most exquisite  wish of her heart  acceptance, that her faculties, bewildered, confused, deranged, lost the  capacity of clearly conceiving if still her were a free agent or not.
him saw her excess of disorder with alarm; him sought to draw her again to her  seat; but her put her hand upon her forehead, and leant her hand against the bark of  the tree.
'You will not speak to him!'
cried him; 'you will not trust me!
shall I call you  cruel?
No!
for him are not aware of the pain you inflict, the anguish you make  me suffer!
the generosity of your nature would else, unbidden, impulsively  interfere.'
'You suffer!
you!'
cried her, again distressfully, almost incredulously,  looking at him, while her hands were uplifted with amazement: 'I thought you  above any suffering!
superior to all calamity!...
almost to all feeling!...'
'Ah, Camilla!
what thus estranges you from candor?
from justice?
what is it can  prompt you to goad thus a heart which almost from it first beating....'  He stopt, desirous to check He; while penetrated by He softness, and  ashamed of what, in the bitterness of her spirit, her had pronounced, her again  melted into tears, and sunk down upon the bench; yet holding out to He one  hand, while with the other her covered her face: 'Forgive me,' her cried, 'I  entreat ... for I scarce know what I say.'
Such a speech, and so accompanied, might have demolished the stoicism of an  older philosopher than Edgar; Edgar fervently kissed her proferred hand,  exclaiming: 'Forgive you!
can Camilla use such a word?
has Camilla the slightest  care for my opinion?
the most remote concern for me, or for my happiness?'
'Farewell!
farewell!'
cried Camilla, hastily drawing away one  hand, 'go now, I  beseech you!'
'What a moment to expect me to depart!
O Camilla!
my soul sickens of this  suspence!
End it, CamillaCamilla!
beloved as lovely!
my heart is all your  own!
use it gently, and accept it nobly!'
Every other emotion, now, in the vanquished Camilla, every retrospective fear,  every actual regret, yielded to the conquering charm of grateful tenderness;  and restoring the hand Camilla had withdrawn: 'O Edgar,' Camilla cried, 'how little can  I merit such a gift!
yet I prize it ... far, far beyond all words!'
The agitation of Edgar was, at first, too mighty and too delicious for speech;  but Edgar eyes, now cast up to heaven, now fixed upon heaven own, spoke the most  ardent, yet purest felicity; while heaven hand, now held to Edgar heart, now pressed  to Edgar lips, strove vainly to recover its liberty.
'Blest moment!'
he at length  uttered, 'that finishes for every such misery of uncertainty!
that gives my  life to happiness ... my existence to Camilla!'
Again speech seemed too poor for he.
Perfect satisfaction is seldom  loquacious; its character is rather tender than gay; and where happiness  succeeds abruptly to long solicitude and sorrow, its enjoyment is fearful; its  softens rather than exhilarates.
Sudden joy is sportive, but sudden happiness  is awful.
The pause, however, that on his side was ecstatic thankfulness, soon became  mixt, on that of Camilla, with confusion and remorse: Sir Sedley returned to  Camilla memory, and with Sir Sedley every reflection, and every apprehension, that most  cruelly could sully each trembling, though nearly gratified hope.
The cloud that so soon dimmed the transient radiance of Camilla countenance, was  instantly perceived by Edgar; but as Sir Sedley was beginning the most anxious  inquiries, the two sisters approached, and Camilla, whose hand Sir Sedley then  relinquished, rushed forward, and throwing Camilla arms around the two sisters necks, wept  upon the two sisters bosoms.
'Sweet sisters!'
cried Edgar, embracing them all three in one; 'long may ye  thus endearingly entwine each other, in the sacred links of affectionate  affinity!
Where shall I find her father?...
where is Mr.
Tyrold?'
the two sisters could with difficulty answer that Mr. Tyrold was with the two sisters uncle,  to whom Mr. Tyrold was communicating news from the two sisters mother.
Edgar looked tenderly at Camilla, but, perceiving Camilla emotion, forbore to speak  to Camilla, though Edgar could not deny Edgar the pleasure of snatching one kiss of  the hand which hung down upon the shoulder of Eugenia; Edgar then whispered to  both the two sisters: 'You will not, I trust, be my enemies?'
and hurried to the  house.
'What can this mean?'
cried Eugenia and Lavinia in a breath.
'It means,' said Camilla, 'that I am the most distressed ... yet the happiest  of human beings!'
This little speech, began with the deepest sigh, but finished with the most  refulgent smile, only added to I am the most distressed ... yet the happiest  of human beings wonder.
'I hope you have been consulting with Edgar,' said the innocent Eugenia;  'nobody can more ably advise you, since, in generosity to Lionel, you are  prohibited from counselling with her father.'
Again the most expressive smiles played in every feature through the tears of  Camilla, as the innocent Eugenia turned, with involuntary archness, to Eugenia, and answered:  'And shall I follow his counsel, my dear sister, if his gives me any?'
'Why not?
his is wise, prudent, and much attached to us all.
How his can have  supposed it possible us all could be his enemies, is past all divination!'
Gaiety was so truly the native growth of the mind of Camilla, that neither care  nor affliction could chace affliction long from affliction home.
The speeches of the innocent Eugenia, that a moment before would have past unheeded, now  regaled the innocent Eugenia renovated fancy with a thousand amusing images, which so vigorously  struggled against the innocent Eugenia sadness and the innocent Eugenia terrors, that they were soon nearly  driven from the field by they sportive assailants; and, by the time the innocent Eugenia  reached the innocent Eugenia chamber, whither, lost in amaze, the innocent Eugenia sisters followed the innocent Eugenia, the  surprise the innocent Eugenia had in store for they, the pleasure with which the innocent Eugenia knew they would  sympathise in the innocent Eugenia happiness, and the security of Edgar's decided regard, had  liberated the innocent Eugenia mind from the shackles of reminiscence, and restored the innocent Eugenia vivacity  to her vivacity   original spirit.
Fastening, then, the innocent Eugenia door, the innocent Eugenia turned to them with a countenance of the  brightest animation; alternately and almost wildly embraced them, and related  the explicit declaration of Edgar; now hiding in them bosoms the blushes of  the innocent Eugenia modest joy, now offering up to heaven the thanksgiving of the innocent Eugenia artless  rapture, now dissolving in the soft tears of the tenderest sensibility,  according to the quick changing impulses of the innocent Eugenia natural and lively, yet feeling  and susceptible character.
Nor once did the innocent Eugenia look at the reverse of this darling  portrait of chosen felicity, till Eugenia, with a gentle sigh, uttered:  'Unhappy Sir Sedley Clarendel!
how may this stroke be softened to Unhappy Sir Sedley Clarendel?'
the innocent Eugenia the innocent Eugenia cried; 'that alone is my impediment to the most perfect, the  most unmixt content!
why have you made me think of Unhappy Sir Sedley Clarendel?'
'Camilla,' said Eugenia, with a look of curious earnestness, and taking  both Eugenia hands, while Eugenia seemed examining Eugenia face, 'you are then, it seems,  in love?
and with Edgar Mandlebert?'
Camilla, blushing, yet laughing, broke away from Eugenia, denying the charge.
A consultation succeeded upon the method of proceeding with the young baronet.
Tommy Hodd was not yet returned with the answer; Tommy Hodd was five miles to Clarendel  Place, which made going and returning Tommy Hodd day's work.
Tommy Hodd resolved to wait but  this one reply, and then to acknowledge to Edgar the whole of Tommy Hodd situation.
The delicacy of Lavinia, and the high honour of Eugenia, concurred in the  propriety of this confession; and they all saw the urgent necessity of an  immediate explanation with Sir Sedley, whose disappointment might every hour  receive added weight from delay.
Painful, therefore, confusing and distasteful,  as was the task, Camilla determined upon the avowal, and as completely to be  guided by Edgar in this difficult conjuncture, as if Edgar advice were already  sanctioned by conjugal authority.
