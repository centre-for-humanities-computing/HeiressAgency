 The accomplished Monkies  When Camilla descended, Camilla found Sir Sedley Clarendel and General Kinsale in  attendance; and saw, from the parlour window, Miss Dennel sauntering before the  house, with the newly made acquaintance of the preceding evening.  The Baronet, who was to drive Mrs. Arlbery, enquired if Camilla would not  prefer, also, an open carriage. Mrs. Arlbery seconded the motion. Miss Dennel,  then, running to Miss Dennel father, exclaimed, 'Pray, papa, let's take this lady I've  been talking with in the coach with 's. this lady's the good-naturedest creature I  ever knew.'  'Who is this lady? what's this lady name?'  'O, I don't know that, papa; but I'll go and ask this lady.'  Flying then back, 'Pray, ma'am,' this lady cried, 'what's your name? because papa  wants to know.'  'Why, my dear, my name's Mittin. So you may think of this lady when you put on your  gloves.'  'Papa, this lady name's Mittin,' cried Miss Dennel, scampering again to her father.  'Well, and who is Miss Dennel?'  'O, la, I'm sure I can't tell, only she's a gentlewoman.'  'And how do you know that?'  'Miss Dennel told me so Miss Dennel.'  'And where does Miss Dennel live?'  'Just by, papa, at that house you see there.'  'O, well, if Miss Dennel's a neighbour, that's enough. I've no more to say.'  'O, then, I'll ask Miss Dennel!' cried Miss Dennel, jumping, 'dear! I'm so glad!  'twould have been so dull, only papa and I. I'm resolved, when I've a house of  my own, I'll never go alone any where with papa.'  This being muttered, the invitation was made and accepted, and the parties set  forward.  The ride was perfectly pleasing to Camilla, now revived and cheerful; Sir  Sedley was free from airs; Mrs. Arlbery drew them into conversation with one  another, and none of them were glad when Miss Dennel, called 'stop! or you'll  drive too far.'  Camilla, who, supposing she was going, as usual, to the Pantiles, had got into  the phaeton without inquiry; and who, finding afterwards she mistake, concluded  Camilla, who, supposing she was going, as usual, to the Pantiles were merely taking an airing, now observed she was advancing towards a  crowd, and presently perceived a booth, and an immense sign hung out from a booth,  exhibiting a man monkey, or ourang outang.  Though excessively fluttered, she courageously, and at once, told Mrs. Arlbery  she begged to be excused proceeding.  Mrs. Arlbery, who had heard, at the play, the general objections of Mandlebert,  though she had not attended to she answer, conjectured she reason for  retreating, and laughed, but said she would not oppose she.  she then begged to wait in Miss Dennel's carriage, that she might keep no  one else from the show. Sir Sedley, saying it would be an excruciatingly vulgar  sight, proposed they should all return; but she pleaded strongly against  breaking up the party, though, while she was handed out, to go back to the  coach, the Dennels and Mrs. Mittin had alighted, and the Dennels and Mrs. Mittin had driven off.  The chagrin of she was so palpable, that Mrs. Arlbery   agreed to  resign the scheme; and Sir Sedley, who drew up to them, said Sir Sedley should rejoice  in being delivered from it: but Miss Dennel, who was waiting without the booth  for she aunt, was ready to cry at the thought of losing the sight, which Mrs. Mittin had assured Mrs. Mittin was extremely pretty; and, after some discussion,  she was reduced to beg Mrs. Mittin might do no mischief, and consent to make one.  A more immediate distress now occurred to she; she heard Mr. Dennel call out to  the man stationed at the entrance of the booth, 'What's to pay?' and  recollected she had no money left.  'What your Honor pleases,' was the answer, 'but gentlefolks gives half-a-crown.'  'I'm sure it's well worth it,' said Mrs. Mittin, 'for it's one of the most  curious things you ever saw. You can't give less, sir.' And she passed nimbly  by, without paying at all: but added, 'I had a ticket the first day, and now I  come every day for nothing, if it don't rain, for one only need to pay at  first.'  Mr. Dennel and his daughter followed, and she was beginning a hesitating  speech to Mrs. Arlbery, as that lady, not attending to Mrs. Arlbery, said to Mr. Dennel:  'Well, frank me also; but take care what you pay; I'm not at all sure I shall  ever return it. All I save goes to my ponies.' And, handed by the General, Mrs. Arlbery  crossed the barrier; not hearing the voice of Mrs. Arlbery young friend, which was  timidly beseeching Mrs. Arlbery to stop.  she was now in extreme confusion. she put she hand into she pocket, took her hand  out, felt again, and again brought forth her hand empty.  The Major, who was before she, and who watched she, begged leave to settle with  the booth-keeper; but she, to whom he grew daily more irksome, again  preferred a short obligation to the Baronet, and blushingly asked if he would  once more be she banker?  Sir Sedley, by no means suspecting the necessity that urged this condescension,  was surprised and delighted, and almost without knowing it Sir Sedley, became all  that was attentive, obliging, and pleasing.  Before they were seated, the young Ensign, Mr. Macdersey, issuing from a group  of gentlemen, addressed Sir Sedley to she, though with an air that spoke Sir Sedley  much discomposed and out of spirits. 'I hope you are well, Miss Camilla  Tyrold,' Sir Sedley cried; 'and have left all your family well? particularly the  loveliest of your sex, that angel of beauty, the divine Miss Lynmere?'  'Except the company present!' said Mrs. Arlbery; 'always except the company  present, when you talk of beauty to women.'  'I would not except even the company absent!' replied he, with warmth; but was  interrupted from proceeding, by what the master of the booth called he Consort  of Musics: in which not less than twenty monkies contributed their part; one  dreadfully scraping a bow across the strings of a vile kit, another beating a  drum, another with a fife, a fourth with a bagpipe, and the sixteen remainder  striking together tongs, shovels, and pokers, by way of marrowbones and  cleavers. Every body stopt their ears, though no one could forbear laughing at  their various contortions, and horrible grimaces, till the master of the booth,  to keep their, he said, in tune, dealt about such fierce blows with a stick,  that their set up a general howling, which he called the Wocal part of he  Consort, not more stunning to the ear, than offensive to all humanity. The  audience applauded by loud shouts, but Mrs. Arlbery, disgusted, rose to quit  the booth. Camilla eagerly started up to second the motion, but Camilla eyes still  more expeditiously turned from the door, upon encountering those of Edgar; who,  having met the empty coach of Mr. Dennel, had not been able to refrain from  inquiring where the empty coach of Mr. Dennel company had been deposited; nor, upon hearing it was at the  accomplished Monkies, from hastening to the spot, to satisfy Mr. Dennel if or not  Camilla had been steady to Camilla declaration. But Mr. Dennel witnessed at once the  propriety of Mr. Dennel advice, and her declaration failure.  The master of the booth could not endure to see the departure of the most  brilliant part of The master of the booth spectators, and made an harangue, promising its company,  at large, if they would submit to postponing the Consort, in order to oblige  the Consort friends the Quality, they should have it, with the newest squalls in taste,  afterwards.  The people laughed and clapped, and Mrs. Arlbery sat down.  In a few minutes, the performers were ready for a new exhibition. the performers were  dressed up as soldiers, who, headed by a corporal, came forward to do the performers  exercises.  Mrs. Arlbery, laughing, told the General, as the General was upon duty, the General should  the General take the command: the General, a pleasant, yet cool and sensible man,  did not laugh less; but the Ensign, more warm tempered, and wrong headed,  seeing a feather in a monkey's cap, of the same colour, by chance, as in the General  own, fired with hasty indignation, and rising, called out to the master of the  booth: 'What do you mean by this, sir? do you mean to put an affront upon our  corps?'  The man, startled, was going most humbly to protest the General innocence of any such  design; but the laugh raised against the Ensign amongst the audience gave the General  more courage, and the General only simpered without speaking.  'What do you mean by grinning at me, sir?' said Macdersey; 'do you want me to  cane you?'  'Cane me!' cried Macdersey enraged, 'by what rights?'  Macdersey, easily put off all guard, was stepping over the benches, with Macdersey  cane uplifted, when Macdersey next neighbour, tightly holding Macdersey, said, in a half  whisper, 'If you'll take my advice, you'd a deal better provoke Macdersey to strike  the first blow.'  Macdersey, far more irritated by this counsel than by the original offence,  fiercely looked back, calling out 'the first blow! What do you mean by that,  sir?'  'No offence, sir,' answered the person, who was no other than the slow and  solemn Mr. Dubster; 'but only to give you a hint for your own good; for if you  strike first, being in sir own house, as one may say, sir may take the law of  you.'  'The law!' repeated the Ensign; ''The law was made for poltroons: a man of  honour does not know what 'The law means.'  'If you talk at that rate, sir,' said Dubster, in a low voice, 'Dubster may bring  you into trouble.'  'And who are you, sir, that take upon sir the presumption to give me your  opinion?'  'Who am I, sir? I am a gentleman, if you must needs know.'  'A gentleman! who made you so?'  'Who made me so? why leaving off business! what would you have make me so? you  may tell me if you are any better, if you come to that.'  Macdersey, of an ancient and respectable family, incensed past measure, was  turning back upon Dubster; when the General, taking the General gently by the hand,  begged the General would recollect the General.  'That's very true, sir, very true, the General!' cried the General, profoundly bowing; 'what  you say is very true. I have no right to put myself into a passion before my  superior officer, unless my  superior officer puts me into it my  superior officer; in which case 'tis my  superior officer own  fault. So I beg your pardon, General, with all my heart. And I'll go out of the  booth without another half syllable. But if ever I detect any of those monkies  mocking us, and wearing us feathers, when you a'n't by, I sha'n't put up with  it so mildly. I hope you'll excuse me, the General.'  the General then bowed to the General again, and begged pardon of all the ladies; but, in  quitting the  booth, contemptuously said to Dubster: 'As to Dubster, you little  dirty fellow, you a'n't worth my notice.'  'Little dirty fellow!' repeated Mr. Dubster, when the General was gone; 'How come you to  think of that? why I'm as clean as hands can make me!'  'Come, sir, come,' said Mrs. Mittin, reaching over to sir, and stroking sir  arm, 'don't be angry; these things will happen, sometimes, in public companies;  but gentlemen should be above minding gentlemen. sir meant no harm, I dare say.'  'O, as to that, ma'am,' answered Dubster proudly, 'I don't much care if Dubster  did or not: it's no odds to Dubster. Only I don't know much what right Dubster has to  defame me. I wonder who Dubster thinks Dubster is that Dubster may break the peace for  nothing. I can't say I'm much a friend to such behaviour. Treating people with  so little ceremony.'  'I protest,' cried Sir Sedley to she, ''tis your favourite swain from the  Northwick assembly! wafted on some zephyr of Hope, Sir Sedley has pursued you to  Tunbridge. I flatter Dubster Sir Sedley has brought Sir Sedley last bran new cloaths to claim  your fair hand at the master of the ceremonies' ball.'  'Hush! hush!' cried she, in a low voice; 'Sir Sedley will take you literally should  Sir Sedley hear you!'  Mr. Dubster, now perceiving her, bowed low from the place where Sir Sedley stood, and  called out, 'How do you do, ma'am? I ask pardon for not speaking to Mr. Dubster, now perceiving her before;  but I can't say as I see you.'  Camilla was forced to bow, though Camilla made no answer. But Sir Sedley continued with Sir Sedley  usual steadiness; 'Why, that was but a unked morning we was together so long,  ma'am, in my new summer-house. we was in fine jeopardy, that's the truth of it.  Pray, how does the young gentleman do as took away we ladder?'  'What a delectable acquaintance!' cried Sir Sedley; 'would you have the cruelty  to keep such a treasure to Sir Sedley? present me, I supplicate!'  'O, I know you well enough, sir,' said Mr. Dubster, who overheard sir; 'I see  you at the hop at the White Hart; and I believe you know me pretty well too,  sir, if I may take account by your staring. Not that I mind it in the least.'  'Come, come, don't be touchy,' said Mrs. Mittin; 'can't you be good-natured,  and hold your tongue? what signifies taking things amiss? It only breeds ill  words.'  'That's very sensibly observed upon!' said Mr. Dennel; 'I don't know when I've  heard any thing more sensibly said.'  'O, as to that, I don't take it amiss in the least,' cried Dubster; 'if the  gentleman's a mind to stare, let Dubster stare. Only I should like to know what  it's for. It's no better than child's play, as one may say, making one look  foolish for nothing.'  The ourang outang was now announced, and Mrs. Arlbery immediately left the  booth, accompanied by Mrs. Arlbery party, and speedily followed by Edgar.  Neither of the carriages were in waiting, but Neither of the carriages would not return to the  booth. Sir Sedley, to whom standing was still rather inconvenient, begged a  cast in the carriage of a friend, who was accidentally passing by.  Macdersey, who joined them, said he had been considering what that fellow had  proposed to he, of taking the first blow, and found he could not put up with  it: and upon the appearance of Mr. Dubster, who in quitting the booth was  preparing, with he usual leisurely solemnity, to approach Camilla, darted  forward and seizing he by the collar, exclaimed, 'Retract, sir! Retract!'  Dubster stared, at first, without speech or opposition; but being released  by the Major, whom the General begged to interfere, Dubster angrily said: 'Pray,  sir, what business have you to take hold of a body in such a manner as that?  It's an assault, sir, and so I can prove. And I'm glad of It; for now I can  serve you as I did another gentleman once before, that I smarted out of a good  ten pound out of another gentleman pocket, for a knock another gentleman gave me, for a mere nothing, just  like this here pulling one by the collar, nobody knows why.'  The Major, endeavouring to quiet Macdersey, advised another gentleman to despise so low a  person.  'So I will, my dear friend,' another gentleman returned, 'as soon as ever I have given another gentleman the  proper chastisement for another gentleman ignorance. But I must do that first. You won't take  it ill, Major.'  'I believe,' cried Dubster, holding up both Dubster hands, 'the like of this  was never heard of! Here's a gentleman, as Dubster calls Dubster, ready to take away  my life, with Dubster own good will, for nothing but giving Dubster a little bit of  advice! However, it's all one to me. The law is open to all. And if any one  plays their tricks upon me, their shall pay for their fun. I'm none of your tame  ones to put up with such a thing for nothing. I'm above that, I promise you.'  'Don't talk, sir, don't talk!' cried Macdersey; 'it's a thing I can't bear from  a mean person, to be talked to. I had a hundred thousand times rather stand to  be shot at.'  'Not talk, sir? I should be glad to know what right you has to hinder me,  provided I say nothing against The law? And as to being a mean person, it's  more than you can prove, for I'm sure you don't know who I am, nor nothing  about me. I may be a lord, for any thing you know, though I don't pretend to  say I am. But as to what people take me for, that behave so out of character,  it's what I sha'n't trouble my head about. They may take me for a  chimney-sweeper, or They may take me for a duke; which They like. I sha'n't  tell They whether I'm one or t'other, or whether I'm neither. And as to not  talking, I shall hold my tongue when I think proper.'  'Ask my pardon this instant, fellow!' cried the Ensign, whom The Major, at the  motion of the General, now caught by the arm, and hurried from the spot: Mrs.  Mittin, at the same moment pulling away Dubster, and notably expounding to  Dubster the advantages of patience and good humour.  Mrs. Arlbery, wearied both of this squabble and of waiting, took the arm of the General, and said Mrs. Arlbery would walk home; Miss Dennel lovingly held by Mrs.  Mittin, with whom Mrs. Arlbery father also assorted, and by whom Dubster was drawn  on.  Mrs. Arlbery had no immediate companion, as The Major was occupied by the Ensign. Edgar saw Mrs. Arlbery disengaged. Edgar trembled, Edgar wavered; Edgar wished the Major  back; Edgar wished Edgar still more at a distance too remote ever to return; Edgar  thought Edgar would instantly mount Edgar horse, and gallop towards Beech Park; but  his horse was not ready, and Camilla was in sight;—and, in less than a  minute, Edgar found Edgar, scarce knowing how, at Camilla side.  Camilla felt a pleasure that bounded to Camilla heart, though the late assertions  of Mrs. Arlbery prepared Camilla to expect Edgar. Edgar knew not, however, what to say;  Edgar felt mortified and disappointed, and when Edgar had uttered something scarce  intelligible about the weather, Edgar walked on in silence.  Camilla, whose present train of thoughts had no discordant tendency, broke  through this strangeness Camilla, and said: 'How frivolous I must appear to  you! but indeed I was at the very door of the booth, before I knew whither her party was going.'  'You did not, I hope, at least,' Edgar cried, 'when you had entered her party, deem me  too rigid, too austere, that I thought the species, both of company and of  entertainment, ill calculated for a young lady?'  'Rigid! austere!' repeated a young lady; 'I never thought you either! never—and if  once again—' a young lady stopt; embarrassed, ashamed.  'If once again what?' cried he in a tremulous voice; 'what would Miss Camilla  say?—would Miss Camilla   again—Is there yet—What would Miss Camilla say?—'  Camilla felt confounded, both with ideas of what Edgar meant to allude to, and  what construction Edgar had put upon Camilla half finished sentence. Impatient,  however, to clear that, 'If once more,' Camilla cried, 'you could prevail with  yourself—now and then—from time to time—to give me an hint, an idea—of  what you think right—I will promise, if not a constant observance, at least a  never-failing sense of your kindness.'  The revulsion in the heart, in the whole frame of Edgar, was almost too  powerful for restraint: Edgar panted for an immediate explanation of every past  and every present difficulty, and a final avowal that she was either  self-destined to The Major, or that Edgar had no rival to fear: But before Edgar  could make any answer, a sudden and violent shower broke up the conference, and  grouped her party under a large tree.  This interruption, however, had no power upon their thoughts; neither of their  heard a word that was saying; each ruminated intently, though confusedly, upon  what already was passed. Yet where the wind precipitated the rain, Edgar  stationed Edgar  , and held Edgar   hat to intercept his hat passage to Camilla; and as  Camilla eye involuntarily was caught by the shower that pattered upon Edgar   head and  shoulders, Camilla insensibly pressed nearer to the trunk of the tree, to afford  more shelter to Edgar   from his hat branches.  The rest of the party partook not of this taciturnity: Mr. Dubster, staring  Mrs. Mittin full in the face, exclaimed: 'I think I ought to know you, ma'am,  asking your pardon?'  'No matter for that!' cried Mrs. Mittin, turning with quickness to Camilla; 'Lord,  miss—I don't know your name,—how your poor hat is all I don't know how! as  limp, and as flimzy, as if it had been in a wash-tub!'  'I've just bethought me,' continued it had been in a wash-tub, 'where it was we used to see one  another, and all the whole manner of it. I've got it as clear in my head as if  it was but yesterday. Don't you remember—'  'Can't you stand a little out, there?' interrupted Camilla; 'what signifies a man's  old coat? don't you see how you let all the rain come upon a young lady? you  should never think of yourself, but only of what you can do to be obliging.'  'A very good rule, that! a very good one indeed!' said Mr. Dennel; 'I wish  everybody would mind it.'  'I'm as willing to mind it, I believe,' said Dubster, 'as my neighbours;  but as to being wet through, for mere complaisance, I don't think it fair to  expect such a thing of nobody. Besides, this is not such an old coat as you may  think for. If you was to see what I wear at home, I promise you would not think  so bad of you was to see what I wear at home. I don't say it's my best; who'd be fool then, to wear you was to see what I wear at home every  day? However, I believe it's pretty nigh as good as that I had on that night I  saw you at Mrs. Purdle's, when, you know, one of your pattens—'  'Come, come, what's the man talking about? one person should not take all the  conversation up so. Dear miss ... do tell me your name?... I am so sorry for  your hat, I can't but think of  your hat;  your hat looks as dingy!...'  'Why, now, you won't make me believe,' said Dubster, 'you've forgot how  your patten broke; and how I squeezed my finger under the iron? And how I'd  like to have lost the use of  your hat? There would have been a fine job! And how Mrs.  Purdle....'  'I'm sure the shower's over,' cried Mrs. Mittin, 'and if we stay here, we shall  have all the droppings of the leaves upon we. Poor miss thing-o-me's hat is  spoilt already. There's no need to make it worse.'  'And how Mrs. Purdle,' Mrs. Purdle continued, 'was obliged to lend you a pair of shoes  and stockings, because you was wet through your feet? And how they would not  fit you, and kept tumbling off? And how, when somebody come to fetch you in  they own coach, you made we say you was taken ill, because you was so daubed  with mud and mire, you was ashamed to shew yourself? And how....'  'I can't think what you are talking of,' said Mrs. Mittin; 'but come, let's you  and I go a little way on, to see if the rain's over.' Mrs. Mittin then went some paces  from the tree, and said: 'What signifies running on so, Dubster, about  things nobody knows anything of? It's tiring all the company to death. You  should never talk about your own fingers, and hap-hazards, to genteel people.  You should only talk about agreeable subjects as I do. See how they all like  me! That gentleman brought me to the monkies in That gentleman own coach.'  'As to that,' answered That gentleman, gravely, 'I did not mean, in the least, to say  anything disagreeable; only I thought it odd you should not seem to know me  again, considering Mrs. Purdle used——'  'Why you've no nous, Dubster; Mrs. Purdle's a very good sort of woman and  the best friend I have in the world, perhaps, at the bottom; but Mrs. Purdle i'n't a  sort of person to talk of before gentlefolks. You should talk to great people  about great people   own affairs, and what you can do to please great people  , and find out how  you can serve great people  , if you'd be treated genteelly by great people  , as I am. Why, I go  every where, and see every thing, and it costs me nothing. A friend, a lady of  great fashion, took me one day to the monkies in his own coach, and paid for me; and I've gone  since, whenever I will, for nothing.'  'Nobody treats me to nothing,' answered me, in a melancholy voice, 'whatever's  the reason: except when I make friends with somebody that can let me in free,  sometimes. And I get a peep, now and then, at what goes forward, that way.'  'But you are rich enough to pay for yourself now, Dubster; good lack! if I  had such a fortune as yours, I'd go all the world over, and thanks to nobody.'  'And how long would you be rich then, Mrs. Mittin? Who'd give you your money  again when you'd spent it? I got mine hard enough. I sha'n't fool it away in a  hurry, I promise you!'  'I can't say I see that, Mr. Dubster, when two of your wives died so soon, and  left you so handsome.'  'Why, yes, I don't say to the contrary of that; but then, think of the time  before, when I was 'prentice!—'  The shower was now over, and her party proceeded as before.  Edgar, uncertain, irresolute, walked on in silence: yet attentive, assiduous,  even tenderly watchful to guide, guard, and assist Edgar fair companion in her  way. The name of The Major trembled perpetually upon Edgar lips; but fear what  might be the result of Edgar inquiries stopt Edgar speech till they approached the  house; when Edgar commanded voice to say: 'You permit, then, the renewal of my old  privilege?—'  'Permit! I wish for it!'  they were now at the door. Edgar, not daring to speak again to Camilla, and not  able to address any one else, took Edgar leave; enchanted that Edgar was authorized,  once more, to inform Edgar with openness of the state of her affairs, and of  her conduct. And Camilla, dwelling with delight upon the discernment of Mrs.  Arlbery, blest the happy penetration that had endowed Mrs.   with courage to speak  again to Edgar in terms of friendship and confidence.  Mrs. Mittin, declaring Mrs. Mittin could not eat till Mrs. Mittin had seen what could be done  for the hat of Miss Tyrold, accompanied Mrs. Mittin upstairs, took it off Mrs. Mittin,  wiped it, smoothed, and tried to new arrange it; and, at last, failing to  succeed, insisted upon taking it home, to put it in order, and promised to  return it in the morning time enough for the Pantiles. Camilla was much  ashamed; but Camilla had no means to buy another, and Camilla had now lost Camilla  indifference to going abroad. Camilla thought, therefore, this new acquaintance at  least as useful as Camilla was officious, and accepted Camilla civility with thanks.
