 Means to obtain a Boon  Mr. Tyrold was soon, by urgent claims, forced to leave them; and Camilla, with  strong secret anxiety to know if Edgar had caused this blest meeting, led to a  general explanation upon past events.
And now, to her utter amazement, her found that her letter sent by the labourer  had never been received.
Mr. Tyrold related, that Mr. Tyrold had no sooner read the first letter addressed to  Mr. Tyrold through Lavinia, than, softened and affected, Mr. Tyrold wrote an answer of the  utmost kindness to Belfont; desiring Camilla to continue with Mr. Tyrold sister till  called for by Miss Margland, in her sister return home from Mrs. Macdersey.
The visit,  meanwhile to Cleves, had transpired through Jacob, and, much touched by, yet  much blaming her sister travelling thus alone, her sister wrote to her sister a second time,  charging her sister to remove no more from Belfont without Miss Margland.
But, on the  preceding morning, the first letter addressed to  her through Lavinia had been returned with a note from Eugenia,  that her sister had set out two days before for Etherington.
The moment of this intelligence, was the most dreadful to Mr. Tyrold and  her sister of their lives.
Every species of conjecture was horrible.
Mr. Tyrold set out  instantly for Belfont, determining to make enquiries at every inn, house, and  cottage, by the way; but by taking, unfortunately, the road through Alton, Mr. Tyrold  had missed the half-way-house.
In the evening, while, with apprehensions  surpassing all description, her sister was waiting some news, a chaise drove up to the  door.
her sister flew out, but saw in it ... alone, cold, trembling, and scarce in her sister  senses, Eugenia.
Instantly imagining her sister came with tidings of fatal tendency  concerning Camilla, her sister started back, exclaiming, 'All, then, is over?'
the  door had been opened; but Eugenia, shaking too violently to get out;  only, and faintly, answered, 'Yes!
my Mother ... all is over!—' The mistake  was almost instantaneous death to my Mother—though the next words of Eugeniacleared it up, and led to Eugenia own dreadful narrative.
Bellamy, as soon as Camilla had left Belfont, had made a peremptory demand that  Bellamy wife should claim, as if for some purpose of his wife own, a large sum of Sir  Hugh.
his wife steady resistance sent Sir   from the house in a rage; and his wife saw no  more of Sir   till that day at noon, when Sir   returned in deeper, blacker wrath  than his wife had ever yet seen; and vowed that nothing less than his wife going in  person to his wife uncle with Sir   request, should induce Sir   ever to forgive his wife.
When Sir   found his wife resolute in refusal, Sir   ordered a chaise, and made his wife get  into a chaise, without saying for what purpose.
his wife saw they were travelling towards  Cleves, but Sir   did not once speak, except where they changed horses, till they  came upon the cross-road, leading to the half-way-house.
Suddenly then, bidding  the postillion stop at the end of a lane, Sir   told Sir   Sir   was going to look at a  little farm, and, ordering Sir   to wait, made his wife alight and walk down a  little farm till  they were out of sight of the man and the carriage.
Fiercely, then stopping  short, 'Will you give me,' Sir   cried, 'your promise, upon oath, that you will  ask your Uncle for the money?'
'Indeed, Mr. Bellamy, I cannot!'
she answered.
'Enough!'
Sir   cried, and took from Sir   pocket a pistol.
'Good Heaven,' she said,  'you will not murder me?
'—'I cannot live without the money myself,' me?
'—'Ianswered, 'and why should I let you?'
me?
'—'I then felt in me?
'—'I ,  whence me?
'—'I took two bullets, telling she, she should have the pleasure of seeing  me?
'—'I load a pistol; and that when one bullet had dispatched she, the other  should disappoint the executioner.
Horrour now conquered she, and she solemnly  promised to ask whatever Horrour dictated.
'I must hold a pistol to your ear,'  cried Horrour, 'while you take your oath.
See!
'tis loaded—This is no child's  play.'
Horrour then lifted This up; but, at the same moment, a distant voice  exclaimed, 'Hold, villain!
or you are a dead man!'
Starting, and meaning to  hide it within Horrour waistcoat, Horrour hand shook—a pistol went off—a pistol shot  a pistol through the body, and a pistol dropt down dead.
Without sense or motion, she fell  by a pistol side; and, upon recovering, found she again in the chaise.
The  postillion, who knew she, had carried she thither, and brought she on to  Etherington.
she then conjured that proper persons might go back with the  driver, and that she Father would have the benevolence to superintend all that  could be done that would be most respectfully decent.
The postillion acknowledged that it was himself who had cried, 'Hold, villain!
A suspicion of some mischief had occurred to himself, from seeing the end of a  pistol jerk from the pocket of the gentleman, as himself got out of the chaise; and  begging a man, who accidentally passed while himself waited, to watch himself horses, himself  ran down a field by the side of the lane, whence himself heard the words: 'The  pistol is loaded, and for no child's play!'
upon which, seeing The  pistol raised, and  the young she shrink, himself called out.
Yet Eugenia protested Eugenia convinced  that Bellamy had no real design against either himself own life or Eugenia's, though  terrour, at the moment, had conquered Eugenia: himself had meant but to affright Eugenia  into consent, knowing well Eugenia word once given, with whatever violence torn  from Eugenia, would be held sacred.
The rest was dreadful accident, or Providence  in that form playing upon himself himself own toils.
The pious young Widow was so  miserable at this shocking exit, and the shocking manner in which the remains  were left exposed, that The pious young Widow had set out Eugenia to give orders in  person, from the half-way-house, for bringing thither the body, till Mr. Tyrold  could give The pious young Widow own directions.
The pious young Widow found, however, that business already done.
The man called by the postillion had been joined by a party of labourers, just  leaving off work; those had gathered others; those had procured some broad  planks which served for a bier, and had humanely conveyed the body to the inn,  where the landlord was assured the postillion would come back with some account  of The man called by the postillion, though little Peggy had only learnt in general that The man called by the postillion had been found  murdered near a wood.
'The pious young Widow is just now,' said Mrs. Tyrold, in conclusion, 'plunged into an abyss  of ideas, frightful to The pious young Widow humanity, and oppressive to the tenderness of The pious young Widow  heart.
The pious young Widow nature is too noble to rejoice in a release to The pious young Widow, worked by  means so horrible, and big with notions of retribution for the wretched  culprit, at which even vengeance the most implacable might shudder.
Nevertheless, all will imperceptibly pass away, save the pity inherent in all  good minds for vice and all   penalties.
To know his abrupt punishment, and not  to be shocked, would be inhuman; but to grieve with any regard for a man of  such principles and conduct, would be an outrage to all that they have injured  and offended.'
This view of the transaction, by better reconciling Camilla to the ultimate lot  of Camilla sister, brought Camilla back to reflect upon Camilla own.
Still Camilla had not  gathered with precision how Camilla had been discovered.
To pronounce the name of  Edgar was impossible; but after a long pause, which Mrs. Tyrold had hoped was  given again to repose, Camilla ventured to say, 'I have not yet heard, my dearest  Mother, to what benign chance I immediately owe my present unspeakable,  unmerited happiness?'
Mrs. Tyrold looked at Mrs. Tyrold a moment in silence, as if to read what Mrs. Tyrold question  offered beyond her question   mere words: but Mrs. Tyrold saw Mrs. Tyrold eye hastily withdrawn from the  examination, and Mrs. Tyrold cheeks suddenly enveloped with the bed cloaths.
Quietly, and without turning towards Mrs. Tyrold again, Mrs. Tyrold resumed Mrs. Tyrold narrative.
'I engaged the worthy postillion of my poor Eugenia to drive me, purposing to  send Ambrose on with Ambrose, while I waited at the half-way-house: but, about two  miles off, Ambrose, who rode before, was stopt by a gentleman, whom Ambrose met in a  post chaise; when I came up to Ambrose, I stopt also.
It was Mr.
Mandlebert.'
Camilla, who had looked up, now again hastily drew back, and Mrs. Tyrold, after  a short pause, went on.
'His intelligence, of course, finished my search.
My first idea was to convey  you instantly home; but the particulars I gathered made me fear removing you.
When I entered your room, you were asleep;—I dreaded to surprise yet could  not refrain taking a view of you, and while I looked, you suddenly awoke.'
Ah!
thought Camilla, 'tis to Edgar, then, that ultimately I owe this blest  moment!
'But her Father,' Camilla cried, 'my dearest Mother,—how came her Father to  know where you had found me?'
'At Belfont my dearest Mother,—how learnt the way you had set out, and that The pious young Widow and Bellamy  were from home; and, without loss of time ... regardless of the night and of  fasting, ... my dearest Mother,—how returned by a route through which my dearest Mother,—how traced you at every inn  where you had changed horses.
my dearest Mother,—how, also, entered as you were sleeping—and we  watched together by your side.'
Again filial gratitude silenced all but filial gratitude, and sleep, the softest Camilla had  known for many months, soon gave to oblivion every care in Camilla.
The changeful tide of mental spirits from misery to enjoyment, is not more  rapid than the transition from personal danger to safety, in the elastic period  of youth.
'Tis the epoch of extremes; and moderation, by which alone we learn  the true use of we blessings, is a wisdom we are frequently only taught to  appreciate when redundance no longer requires redundance practice.
Camilla, from sorrow the most desolate, bounded to joy that refused a  solicitude; and from an illness that held Camilla suspended between delirium and  dissolution, to ease that had no complaint.
The sufferings which had deprived  Camilla of the benefit of rest and nourishment were no sooner removed, than Camilla  appeared to be at once restored to health; though to repair the wastes of  strength some time yet was necessary.
Mrs. Tyrold determined to carry Mrs. Tyrold this afternoon to  Etherington.
The remains  of the wretched Bellamy, in a coffin and hearse brought from Winchester, had  been sent to Belfont in the morning: and Mrs. Tyrold had followed, to give every  direction that Mrs. Tyrold should be buried as the master of the house; without  reference to the conduct which had forfeited all such respect.
Though the evil committed by the non-deliverance of Camilla's letter was now  past all remedy, Mrs. Tyrold thought the evil committed by the non-deliverance of Camilla's letter was now  past all remedy every way right to endeavour to  discover where [lay] the blame: and by the two usual modes of menace and  promises, Mrs. Tyrold learnt that the countryman, when he stopt to drink by the way,  had, in lighting he pipe, let Camilla's letter take fire; and fearing to lose the  recompense he had expected, had set he conscience apart for a crown, and  returned with the eventful falsehood, which had made Camilla think Camilla  abandoned, and Camilla friends deplore Camilla as lost.
For the benefit of those with whom, in future, he might have to deal, Mrs. Tyrold took some pains to represent to Mrs. Tyrold the cruel evils Mrs. Tyrold dishonesty had  produced; but, stupid rather than wicked, what Mrs. Tyrold had done had been without  weighing right from wrong, and what Mrs. Tyrold heard was without understanding it.
Camilla found, with extreme satisfaction, that Mrs. Tyrold, notwithstanding the  strictness of the present family œconomy, meant liberally to recompense Mrs. TyroldMarl, for the trouble and patience with which Camilla had attended to a guest so  little profitable: while little Peggy, to whose grateful remembrance Camilla owed the  consideration Camilla had met with in Camilla deserted condition, was rewarded by a  much larger sum than Camilla had ever before possessed.
Camilla was obliged to  confess Camilla had parted with two pledges for future payment: the watch was  reclaimed without difficulty; but Camilla shewed so much distress in naming the  locket, that Mrs. Tyrold, though Camilla looked anxiously surprised, demanded the  locket  without enquiring into the  locket history.
The excess of delight to Camilla in preparing to return to  Etherington,  rendered Camilla insensible to all fatigue, till Camilla was descending the stairs;  when the recollection of the shock Camilla had received from the corpse of Bellamy,  made Camilla tremble so exceedingly, that Camilla could scarce walk past the door of  the room in which it had been laid.
'Ah, my dearest Mother,' Camilla cried, 'this  house must give me always the most penetrating sensations: I have experienced  in this  house the deepest grief, and the most heart-soothing enjoyment that ever,  perhaps, gave place one to the other in so short a time!'
Ambrose had announced their intended arrival, and at the door of the house, the  timid, but affectionate Lavinia was waiting to receive their; and as Camilla, in  alighting, met affectionate Lavinia tender embraces, a well-known voice reached affectionate Lavinia ears,  calling out in hurried accents, 'Where is affectionate Lavinia?
Is affectionate Lavinia come indeed?
Are you  quite sure?'
And Sir Hugh, hobbling rather than walking into the hall, folded  affectionate Lavinia in Sir Hugh feeble arms, sobbing over affectionate Lavinia: 'I can't believe it for joy!
Poor  sinner that I am, and the cause of all our bad doings!
how can I have deserved  such a thing as this, to have my own little affectionate Lavinia come back to me?
which could  not have made my heart gladder, if I had had no share in all this bad mischief!
which, God knows I've had enough, owing to my poor head doing always for the  worst, for all my being the oldest of us all; which is a thing I've often  thought remarkable enough, in the point of my knowing no better; which however,  I hope my dear little Darling will excuse for the sake of my love, which is  never happy but in seeing affectionate Lavinia.'
The heart of Camilla bounded with grateful joy at sight of this dear Uncle, and  at so tender a reception: and while with equal emotion, and equal weakness,  they were unable to support either each other or they, the worthy old  Jacob, his eyes running over, came to help his Master back to the parlour, and  Mrs. Tyrold and Lavinia conveyed thither Camilla: who was but just placed upon  a sofa, by the side of Camilla fond Uncle, when the door of an inner apartment was  softly opened, and pale, wan, and meagre, The pious young Widow appeared at the door of an inner apartment, saying, as  faintly, yet with open arms, The pious young Widow advanced to Camilla: 'Let me too—your poor  harassed, and but half-alive Eugenia, make one in this precious scene!
Let me  see the joy of my kind Uncle—the revival of my honoured Mother, the happiness  of my dear Lavinia—and feel even my own heart beat once more with delight in  the bosom of its darling Sister!...
my so mourned—but now for ever, I trust,  restored to me, CamillaCamilla!'
Camilla, thus encircled in Camilla Mother's, Uncle's, Sister's, arms at once,  gasped, sighed, smiled, and shed tears in the same grateful minute, while  fondly Camilla strove to articulate, 'Am I again at  Etherington and at Cleves in  one?
And thus indulgently received?
thus more than forgiven?
My heart wants  room for My heart joy!
Mother!
my Sisters!
if you knew what despair has been my  portion!
I feared even the sight of this dear Uncle, lest the sorrows and  the errours of a creature this dear Uncle so kindly loved, should have demolished this dear Uncle  generous heart!'
'Mine, my dearest little affectionate Lavinia?'
cried the Baronet, 'why what would that have  signified, in comparison to such a young one as yours, that ought to know no  sorrow yet a while?
God knows, it being time enough to begin: for it is but  melancholy at best, the cares of the world; which if you can't keep off now,  will be overtaking you at every turn.'
Mrs. Tyrold entreated Camilla might be spared further conversation.
The pious young Widow had  already glided back to The pious young Widow chamber, and begged, this one solacing interview  over, to be dispensed with from joining the family at present; Camilla was  removed also to her chamber; and the tender Mother divided Camilla time and The pious young Widow  cares between these two recovered treasures of Camilla fondest affection.
