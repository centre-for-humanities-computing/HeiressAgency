 The Reverse of a Mask  The plan of Camilla was to stop within twenty yards of the house of Bellamy,  and then send for Molly Mill. But till she gave this direction to the driver,  she was not aware of the inconvenience of being without a servant, which had  not previously occurred either to Mrs. Berlinton or herself. The man could not  leave his horses, and she was compelled to let him draw up to the gate. There,  when he rang at a bell, her terrour, lest she should suddenly encounter Mrs.  Tyrold, made her bid him open the chaise door, that she might get out and walk  on, before he enquired for Molly. But, in stepping from the carriage, she  discerned, over a paling at some distance, Eugenia herself, alone, slowly  walking, and her head turned another way.  Every personal, and even every filial idea, was buried instantly in this sight.  The disastrous state of this beloved and unhappy sister, and her own peculiar  knowledge of the worthless character of the wretch who had betrayed her into  his snares, penetrated her with an anguish that took thought from all else; and  darting through the great gate, and thence through a smaller one, which opened  to the spot where she saw her walking, she flew to her in a speechless  transport of sorrow, folded her in her arms, and sobbed upon her shoulder.  Starting, shaking, amazed, Eugenia looked at her; 'Good Heaven!' she exclaimed,  'is it my Sister?—Is it Camilla?—Do I, indeed, see one so dear to me?' And,  too weak to sustain herself, she sunk, though not fainting, upon the turf.  Camilla could not articulate a syllable. The horrour she had conceived against  Bellamy chilled all attempt at consolation, and her own misery which, the  preceding moment, seemed to be crushing the springs of life, vanished in the  agonized affection with which she felt the misfortunes of her sister.  Eugenia soon recovered, and rising, and holding her by the hand, yet seeming to  refuse herself the emotion of returning her embraces, said, with a faint effort  to smile; 'You have surprised me, indeed, my dear Camilla, and convicted me to  myself of my vain philosophy. I had thought I should never more be moved thus  again. But I see now, the affections are not so speedily to be all vanquished.'  The melancholy conveyed by this idea of believed apathy, in a young creature so  innocent, and but just dawning into life, still beyond speech, and nearly  beyond sufferance, affected Camilla, who hanging over her, sighed out: 'My  dearest!... dearest Eugenia!'  'And what is it has brought to me this unexpected, but loved sight? Does Mr.  Bellamy know you are here?'  'No,' she answered, shuddering at his name.  Eugenia looked pensive, looked distressed; and casting down her eyes and  hesitating, with a deep sigh said: 'I, ... I have not the trinkets for my dear  Sister ... Mr. Bellamy ...' she stopt.  Called to her sad self by this shock, of which she strove to repress the  emotion, Camilla recollected her own 'almost blunted purpose[6],' and fearfully  asked if their Mother were yet at Belfont.  'Ah, no!' she answered, clasping her hands, and leaning her head upon her  sister's neck: 'She is gone!—The day before yesterday she was with me,—with  me only for one hour!—yet to pass with her such another, I think, my dear  Camilla, would soon lead me where I might learn a better philosophy than that I  so vainly thought I had already acquired here!'  Camilla, struck with awe, ventured not even at an enquiry; and they both, for  some little time, walked on in silence.  'Did she name to you,' at length, in broken accents, she asked, 'did she name  to you, my Eugenia, ... the poor, banished ... Camilla?——'  'Banished? No. How banished?'  'She did not mention me?'  'No. She came to me but upon one subject. She failed in her purpose, ... and  left me.'  A sigh that was nearly a groan finished this short little speech.  'Ah, Heaven! my Eugenia,' cried Camilla, now in agony unresisted, 'tell me,  then, what passed! what new disappointment had my unhappy Mother to sustain?  And how, and by what cruel fatality, has it fallen to your lot ... even to  yours ... to suffer her wishes to fail?'  'You know nothing, then,' said Eugenia, after a pause, 'of her view—her  errand hither?'  'Nothing; but that to see you brought her not only hither, but to England.'  'Blessed may she be!' cried Eugenia, fervently, 'and rewarded where rewards are  just, and are permanent!'  Camilla zealously joined in the prayer, yet besought to know if she might not  be informed of the view to which she alluded?  'We must go, then,' said Eugenia, 'into the house; my poor frame is yet feebler  than my mind, and I cannot support it unaided while I make such a relation.'  Camilla, affrighted, now gave up her request; but the generous Eugenia would  not leave her in suspense. They went, therefore, to a parlour, where, shutting  the doors and windows, she said, 'I must be concise, for both our sakes; and  when you understand me, we must talk instantly of other things.'  Camilla could give only a tacit promise; but her air shewed she would hold it  sacred as any bond.  'The idea which brought over this inestimable Parent, and which brought her, at  a moment when she knew me to be alone, to this sad house, these sad arms ...  Camilla! how shall I speak it? It was to exonerate me from my vows, as forced!  to annul all my engagements, as compulsatory! and to restore me again ... O,  Camilla! Camilla! to my Parents, my Sisters, my Uncle, my dearly-loved Cleves!'  She gasped almost convulsively; yet though Camilla now even conjured her to say  no more, went on: 'A proposal such as this, pressed upon me by one whose  probity and honour hold all calamity at nought, if opposed to the most minute  deviation from right—a proposal such as this ... ah! let me not go back to  the one terrible half instant of demur! It was heart-rending, it was killing! I  thought myself again in the bosom of my loved family!'—  'And is it so utterly impossible? And can it not yet be effected?'—  'No, my dear Sister, no! The horrible scenes I must go through in a public  trial for such a purpose—the solemn vows I must set aside, the re-iterated  promises I must break,——no, my dear Sister, no!... And now, we will speak  of this no more.'  Camilla knew too well her firmness, her enthusiasm to perform whatever she  conceived to be her duty, to enter into any contest. Yet to see her thus self  devoted, where even her upright Mother, and pious Father, those patterns of  resignation to every heaven-inflicted sorrow, thought her ties were repealed by  the very villainy which had formed them, seemed more melancholy, and yet harder  for submission, than her first seizure by the worthless Bellamy.  'And how bore my poor Mother ... my poor unfortunate Mother! destined thus to  woes of every sort, though from children who adore her!—how bore she the  deprivation of a hope that had brought her so far?'  'Like herself! nobly! when once it was decided, and she saw that though, upon  certain avowals, the law might revoke my plighted faith, it could not abrogate  the scruples of my conscience. She thinks them overstrained, but she knows them  to be sincere, and permitted them, therefore, to silence her. Unfit to be seen  by any others, she hurried then away. And then, Camilla, began my trial! Indeed  I thought, when she had left me, ... when my arms no more embraced her honoured  knees, and neither her blessings, nor her sorrows soothed or wounded my ears, I  thought I might defy all evil to assault, all woe to afflict me ever again!  that my eyes were exhausted of every tear, and my heart was emptied of all  power of future feeling. I seemed suddenly quite hardened;—transformed I  thought to stone, as senseless, as immovable, and as cold!'  The sensations of Camilla were all such as she durst not utter; but Eugenia,  assuming some composure; added, 'Of this and of me now enough—speak, my dear  Sister, of yourself. How have you been enabled to come hither? And what could  you mean by saying you were banished?'  'Alas! my dearest Eugenia, if my unhappy situation is unknown to you, why  should I agitate you with new pain? my Mother, I find, spared you; and not only  you, but me—though I have wrung her heart, tortured it by a sight never to be  obliterated from her memory—she would not rob me of my beloved sister's  regard; nor even name me, lest the altered tone of her voice should make you  say, Of what Camilla does my Mother speak?'  Eugenia, with earnest wonder, begged an explanation; but when Camilla found her  wholly uninformed of the history of their Father's confinement, she recoiled  from giving her such a shock: yet having gone too far entirely to recede, she  rested the displeasure of their Mother upon the debts, and the dealings with a  usurer; both sufficiently repugnant to the strictness and nobleness of Mrs.  Tyrold, to seem ample justification of her displeasure.  Eugenia entered into the distresses of her sister, as if exempt herself from  all suffering: and Camilla, thus commiserating and commiserated, knew now how  to tear herself away; for though Eugenia pressed not her stay, she turned pale,  when a door opened, a clock struck, or any thing seemed to prognosticate a  separation; and looked as if to part with her were death.  At length, however, the lateness of the day forced more of resolution. But when  Camilla then rang to give orders for the carriage, the footman said it had been  gone more than two hours. The postillion, being left without any directions,  thought it convenient to suppose he was done with; and knowing Camilla had no  authority, and his lady no inclination to chide him, had given in her little  packet, and driven off, without enquiry.  Far from repining at this mixture of impertinence and carelessness, Camilla  would have rejoiced in an accident that seemed to invite her stay, had not her  sister seemed more startled than pleased by it. She begged, therefore, that a  post chaise might be ordered; and Molly Mill, the only servant to whom the  mistress of the house appeared willing to speak, received the commission. At  sight of Camilla, Molly had cried bitterly, and beginning 'O Miss!—' seemed  entering into some lamentation and detail; but Eugenia, checking her, half  whispered: 'Good Molly, remember what you promised!'  When Molly came back, she said that there were no horses at Belfont, and would  be none till the next morning.  The sisters involuntarily congratulated one another upon this accident, though  they reciprocated a sigh, that to necessity alone they should owe their  lengthened intercourse.  'But, my dear mistress,' cried Molly, 'there's a lad that I know very well, for  I always see him when I go of an errand, that's going to Salisbury; and he says  he must go through Etherington, and if you've any thing you want to send he'll  take it for you; and he can bring any thing back, for he shall be here again to  morrow, for he goes post.'  Eugenia, sending away Molly, said, 'Why should you not seize such an  opportunity to address a few lines to our dear Mother? I may then have the  satisfaction to see her answer: and if, ... as I cannot doubt, she tells you to  return home with Miss Margland;—for she will not, I am sure, let you travel  about alone;—what a relief will it be to me to know the distresses of my  beloved sister are terminated! I shall paint your meeting in my "mind's eye,"  see you again restored to the sunshine of her fondness, and while away my  solitary languor with reveries far more soothing than any that I have yet  experienced at Belfont.'  Camilla embraced her generous Sister; and always readiest for what was  speediest, wrote these lines, directed  To Miss Tyrold.  I cannot continue silent, yet to whom may I address myself? I dare not apply to  my Father—I scarce dare even think of my Mother—Encompassed with all of  guilt with which imprudence could ensnare me, my courage is gone with my  happiness! which way may I then turn? In pity to a wretched sister, drop, O  Lavinia, at the feet of her I durst not name, but whom I revere, if possible,  even more than I have offended, this small and humble memorial of my unhappy  existence—my penitence, my supplication, my indescribable, though merited  anguish!  Camilla.  Could the two sisters, even in this melancholy state, have continued together,  they felt that yet from tender sympathy, consolation might revisit their  bosoms. The day closed in; but they could not bear to part; and though, from  hour to hour, they pronounced an adieu, they still sat on, talked on, and found  a balm in their restored intercourse, so healing and so sweet, that the sun,  though they hailed not its beams, rose while they were yet repeating Good Night!  They then thought it too late to retire, mutually agreeing with how much  greater facility they might recover their lost rest, than an opportunity such  as this for undisturbed conversation.  Every minute of this endearing commerce made separation seem harder; and the  answer for which they waited from Etherington, anxiously and fearfully as it  was expected, so whiled away the minutes, that it was noon, and no chaise had  been ordered, when they heard one driving up to the house.  Alarmed, they listened to know what it portended. 'Mr. Bellamy,' said Eugenia,  in a low voice, 'scarce ever comes home at this hour.'  'Can it be my Mother herself?' cried Camilla.  In a few minutes, however, Eugenia looked pale, ''Tis his step!' she whispered;  and presently Bellamy opened the door.  Obliged to acknowledge his entrance, Camilla arose; but her parched lips and  clammy mouth made her feel as if his sight had given her a fever, and she  attempted not to force any speech.  He did not seem surprized at seeing her, asked how she did, rather cavalierly  than civilly: rang the bell, and gave various orders; addressed scarce a word  to his wife, and walked whistling about the room.  A change so gross and quick from the obsequious Bellamy Camilla had hitherto  seen, was beyond even her worst expectations, and she conceived as low an  opinion of his understanding and his manners, as of his morals.  Eugenia kept her eyes rivetted to the ground; and though she tried, from time  to time, to say something to them both, evidently required her utmost fortitude  to remain in the room.  At length; 'Miss Camilla,' he said, 'I suppose you know Miss Margland is gone?'  'Gone? whither?—how gone?'  'Why home. That is to her home, as she thinks it, Cleves. She set off this  morning with the light.'  Camilla, astonished, was now called forth from her taciturnity; 'What  possibly,' she cried, 'can have induced this sudden journey? Has my uncle sent  for her?'  'No; your uncle has nothing to do with it. She had a letter last night from  Mrs. Macdersey, with one enclosed for Sir Hugh, to beg pardon and so forth; and  this morning she set off to carry it.'  Camilla was confounded. Why Miss Margland had not, at least, called at Belfont  to enquire if she would proceed with her, was beyond all her conjecture.  Soon after, Bellamy's servant came in with a letter for Camilla, which had  arrived after she left town, and was given to him by Mrs. Berlinton's butler.  She retired into the next room to read it, where, to her great consternation,  she found it was from Jacob, and had been written the day of Mr. Tyrold's  arrest, though, as it was sent by a private hand, it had only now arrived.  'Things going,' he said, 'so bad at Cleves, on account of so many misfortunes,  his master was denying himself all his natural comforts, and in particular he  had sent to un-order a new pipe of Madeira, saying he would go without; though,  as Miss might remember, it was the very wine the doctors had ordered for his  stomach. This all the servants had taken so to heart, that they had resolved to  buy it among 'em, and get it privately laid in, and not let his honour know but  what it was always the same, till he had drunk so much he could not help  himself. For this, they were to join, according to their wages or savings; Now  I' says Jacob, 'being, by his gud honnur's genrosty, the ritchist ammung us,  fur my kalling, wants to do the most, after nixt to the buttlur and huskippir,  so, der Miss, awl I've gut beng in the funs, witch I cant sil out withowt los,  if you can lit me have the munny fur the hurs, without ullconvenince, til Miss  Geny that was can pay it, I shul be mutch obbleggd, poor Miss Geny nut hawing  of a fardin, witch wil be a gret fevur to, Madm,  Yur humbbel survent til deth   Jaccub Mord.'  So touching a mark of the fond gratitude of the Cleves' servants to their kind  master, mingled tenderness, in defiance of all horrour, in the tears of  Camilla; but her total inability to satisfy the just claims of Jacob, since now  her resource even in Eugenia failed, with the grief of either defeating his  worthy project, or making it lastingly hurtful to him, was amongst the severest  strokes which had followed her ill advised schemes. To proclaim such an  additional debt, was a shame from which she shrunk; yet to fly immediately to  Cleves, and try to soothe her oppressed uncle, was an idea that still seemed  gifted with some power to soothe herself. Whither indeed else could she now go?  she had no longer either carriage or protectress in town; and what she gathered  of the re-admission of Bellamy to Grosvenor-square, made the cautions and  opinions of Edgar burst forcibly upon her mind, to impede, though most  mournfully, all future return to Mrs. Berlinton.  A pliancy so weak, or so wilful, seemed to announce in that lady an almost  determined incorrigibility in wrong, however it might be checked, in its  progress, by a mingled love of right, and a fear of ill consequences.  'Ah Edgar!' she cried, 'had I trusted you as I ought, from the moment of your  generous declaration—had my confidence been as firm in your kindness as in  your honour, what misery had I been saved!—from this connexion—from my  debts—from every wide-spreading mischief!—I could then have erred no more,  for I should have thought but of your approvance!'  These regrets were, as usual, resuming their absorbing powers;—for all other  evils seemed fluctuating, but here misery was stationary; when the voice of  Bellamy, speaking harshly to his unhappy wife, and some words she unavoidably  caught, by which she found he was requesting that she would demand money of Sir  Hugh, made her conclude him not aware he was overheard, and force herself back  to the parlour. But his inattention upon her return was so near rudeness, that  she soon felt convinced Mrs. Berlinton had acquainted him with her  remonstrances and ill opinion: he seemed in guilty fear of letting her converse  even a moment with Eugenia; and presently, though with an air of pretended  unconcern, said: 'You have no commands for the chaise I came in, Miss Camilla?'  'No, Sir, ... What chaise?... Why?...' she stammered.  'It's difficult sometimes to get one at this place; and these horses are very  fresh. I bid them stay till they asked you.'  This was so palpable a hint for her to depart, that she could not but answer  she would make use of it, when she had taken leave of her sister; whom she now  looked at with emotions near despair at her fate, and with difficulty  restrained even its most unbridled expressions. But Bellamy kept close, and no  private conference could take place. Eugenia merely said: 'Which way, my dear  sister, shall you go?'  'I ... I am not, fixed—to ... to Cleves, I believe,' answered she, scarce  knowing herself what she said.  'I am very glad of it,' she replied, 'for the sake of my poor—' she found her  voice falter, and did not pronounce 'uncle;' but added, 'as Miss Margland has  already left London, I think you right to go thither at once; it may abridge  many difficulties; and with post-horses, you may be there before it is dark.'  They then embraced tenderly, but parted without any further speech, and she set  off rather mechanically than designedly for Cleves.
