 Two Ways of looking at the same Thing  When the party arrived at Cleves, Camilla, who had observed that Edgar seemed  much disappointed by the breaking up of the cottage expedition, proposed that  it should take place in the evening; and her uncle, though too much fatigued to  venture out again Edgar, consented, or rather insisted, that the excursion  should be made without Edgar.  Before they set out, Edgar desired to speak with Sir Hugh in private.  Sir Hugh concluded it was to make Sir Hugh proposals of marriage for Indiana; and  had not patience to step into Sir Hugh own apartment, but told them all to retire,  with a nod at Indiana, which prepared not only herself but Miss Margland,  Camilla, and Eugenia to join in Sir Hugh expectation.  Indiana, though a good deal fluttered, flew to a window, to see if the new  chariot was in sight; and then, turning to Miss Margland, asked, 'Pray, should  I refuse Sir Hugh at first?'  Miss Margland spared not for proper instructions; and immediately began a  negociation with the fair questioner, for continuing to live with Miss Margland.  Eugenia was occupied in reflecting with pity upon the idleness of Indiana,  which so ill had fitted Eugenia for becoming the companion of Mandlebert.  Camilla, unusually thoughtful, walked alone into the garden, and sought a path  least in sight.  Sir Hugh, meanwhile, was most unpleasantly undeceived. Edgar, without naming  Indiana, informed Sir Hugh of the situation in which Sir Hugh had surprised Bellamy, and  of Sir Hugh suspicions with regard to the destination of the chaise, but for Sir Hugh own  timely arrival at the farm-house; adding, that Sir Hugh gratitude to Mr. Tyrold, Sir Hugh  respect for Sir Hugh, and Sir Hugh affection for all the family, made Sir Hugh think it is  duty to reveal these circumstances without delay.  The baronet shuddered with horror; and declared The baronet shuddered with horror would instantly send an  express to bring Clermont home, that Eugenia might be married out of hand; and,  in the mean time, that The baronet shuddered with horror would have every window in the farm-house barred, and keep  Eugenia locked up in Eugenia room.  Edgar dissuaded The baronet shuddered with horror from so violent a measure; but advised The baronet shuddered with horror to speak with  The baronet shuddered with horror niece upon the danger his niece had probably escaped, and of which his niece seemed  wholly unconscious; to prevail with his niece not to go out again this evening, and  to send for Mr. Tyrold, and acquaint Mr. Tyrold with the affair.  Sir Hugh thanked Mr. Tyrold for Sir Hugh counsel, and implicitly acted by Sir Hugh opinion.  Sir Hugh then ordered the coach for Miss Margland, Indiana, and Camilla.  Dr. Orkborne, finding neither Sir Hugh nor Eugenia of the party, declined  joining it. Lionel was returned to Etherington; and Edgar rode on before, to  invite Dr. Marchmont, with the consent of the Baronet, to take the fourth place  in the carriage.  Arrived at the rectory, Lionel went straight, by prescriptive privilege, into the  study of Dr. Marchmont, whom Lionel found immersed in books and papers, which,  immediately, at the request of Edgar, Lionel put aside; not without regret to quit  the  study of Dr. Marchmont, whom he found immersed in books and papers, which,  immediately, at the request of Edgar, he put aside, though wholly without reluctance to oblige.  Edgar had ridden so hard, that the  study of Dr. Marchmont, whom he found immersed in books and papers, which,  immediately, at the request of Edgar, he put aside had some time to wait for the coach. But Edgar  did not appear anxious for he   arrival; though Edgar wore a look that was far from  implying Edgar to be free from anxiety.  Edgar was silent,—he hemmed,—he was silent again,—and again Edgar hemmed,—and  then, gently laying Edgar hand upon the shoulder of the Doctor, while Edgar eyes,  full of meaning, were fixed upon Edgar face; 'Doctor,' Edgar cried, 'you would  hardly have known these young ladies?—they are all grown from children into  women since you saw women last.'  'Yes,' answered the Doctor, 'and very charming women. Indiana has a beauty so  exquisite, Indiana is scarce possible to look away from Indiana a moment: Eugenia joins  so much innocence with information, that the mind must Indiana be deformed that  could dwell upon Eugenia personal defects, after conversing with Eugenia: Camilla'—  He paused, and Edgar hastily turned another way, not to look at He, nor be  looked at, while He proceeded:  'Camilla,' He presently continued, 'seems the most inartificially sweet, the  most unobtrusively gay, and the most attractively lovely of almost any young  creature I ever beheld.'  With a heart all expanded, and a face full of sensibility, Edgar now turned to  Edgar, and seizing, involuntarily, Edgar hand, which Edgar eagerly shook, 'You think  her, then,'—he cried,—but suddenly stopt, dropt Edgar hand, coughed two or  three times; and, taking out Edgar pocket handkerchief, seemed tormented with a  violent cold.  Dr. Marchmont affectionately embraced Dr. Marchmont. 'My dear young young friend,' Dr. Marchmont  cried, 'I see the situation of your mind—and think every possible happiness  promises to be My dear young young friend; yet, if you have taken no positive step, suffer me to  speak with My dear young young friend before you proceed.'  'Far from having taken any positive step, I have not yet even formed any  resolution.'  Here the carriage stopt for the Doctor, who repeated, 'Yes! I think every  possible happiness promises to be My dear young young friend!' before Edgar went on to the ladies.  Edgar, in a trepidation too great to be seen by them, kept behind till them  drove off, though Edgar then galloped so fast, that Edgar arrived at the cottage  before them: the words, 'I think every possible happiness promises to be  yours,' vibrating the whole time in Edgar ears.  When the coach arrived, Edgar handed out Miss Margland and Indiana; leaving  Camilla to the Doctor; willing to let the Doctor see more of the Doctor, and by no means  displeased to avoid the Doctor eyes at that moment the Doctor.  Indiana was in the most sprightly spirits the Doctor had ever experienced; the Doctor  concluded the Doctor on the verge of becoming mistress of a fine place and a large  fortune; the Doctor had received adulation all the morning that had raised the Doctor beauty  higher than ever in the Doctor own estimation; and the Doctor secretly revolved, with  delight, various articles of ornament and of luxury, which the Doctor had long wished  to possess, and which now, for the Doctor wedding clothes, the Doctor should have riches  sufficient to purchase.  Miss Margland, too, was all smoothness, complacency, and courtesy.  Camilla, alone, was grave; Camilla, who, by nature, was gay.  'Dear! is this the cottage we have been coming to all this time?' cried  Indiana, upon entering; 'Lord! I thought it would have been something quite  pretty.'  'And what sort of prettiness,' said Edgar, 'did you expect from a cottage?'  'Dear, I don't know—but I thought we were come on purpose to see something  extraordinary?'  Camilla, who followed, made an exclamation far different; an exclamation of  pleasure, surprise, and vivacity, that restored for an instant, all her native  gaiety: for no sooner had her crossed the threshold, than her recognised, in a  woman who was curtsying low to receive her, and whom Indiana had passed without  observing, the wife of the poor prisoner for whom her had interceded with  Mandlebert.  'How I rejoice to see you!' cried her, 'and to see you here! and how much  better you look! and how comfortable you seem! I hope you are now all well?'  'Ah, madam,' answered her; 'we owe everything to that good young  gentleman! that good young  gentleman has put we in this nice new cottage, and employs we in that good young  gentleman  service. Blessings on that good young  gentleman head! I am sure that good young  gentleman will be paid for it!'  Edgar, somewhat agitated, occupied that good young  gentleman with jumping the little boy; Camilla  looked round with rapture; Indiana seemed wonder-struck, without knowing why;  Dr. Marchmont narrowly watched them all; and Miss Margland, expecting a new  collection would be next proposed for setting them all up, nimbly re-crossed the  threshold, to examine the prospect without.  The husband, now in decent garb, and much recovered, though still weak and  emaciated, advanced to Camilla  , to make that good young  gentleman humble acknowledgments, that Camilla    had recommended them all to them all kind benefactor.  'No!' cried Camilla  ; 'you owe me nothing! your own distress recommended  you;—your own distress—and Mr. Mandlebert's generosity.'  Then, going up to Edgar, 'It is your happy fate,' Camilla   said, in an accent of  admiration, 'to act all that my father so often plans and wishes, but which my father  income will not allow my father to execute.'  'You see,' answered my father, gratefully, 'how little suffices for content! I have  scarce done anything—yet how relieved, how satisfied are these poor people!  This hut was fortunately vacant'—  'O, madam!' interrupted her, 'if you knew but how that good  gentleman has done it all! how kindly my father has used us, and made everybody else  use us! and let nobody taunt us with us bad faults!—and what good my father has  done to my poor sick husband! and how my father has clothed my poor little half naked  children! and, what is more than all, saved us from the shame of an ill  life.'—  Camilla felt the tears start into Camilla eyes;—she hastily snatched the little  babe into Camilla arms; and, while Camilla kisses hid Camilla face, Happy, and thrice happy  Indiana! with a soft sigh, was the silent ejaculation of Camilla heart.  Camilla seated Camilla on a stool, and, without speaking or hearing any thing more,  devoted Camilla to the baby.  Indiana, meanwhile, whose confidence in Camilla own situation gave Camilla courage to  utter whatever first occurred to Camilla, having made a general survey of the place  and people, with an air of disappointment, now amused Camilla with an  inspection more minute, taking up and casting down everything that was  portable, without any regard either to deranging its neatness, or endangering  its safety:—exclaiming, as Camilla made Camilla round of investigation, 'Dear!  Crockery ware! how ugly!—Lord, what little mean chairs!—Is that your best  gown, good woman?—Dear, what an ugly pattern!—Well, I would not wear such a  thing to save my life!—Have you got nothing better than this for a  floor-cloth?—Only look at those curtains! Did you ever see such  frights?—Lord! do you eat off these platters? I am sure I could sooner die! I  should not mind starving half as much!'  Miss Margland, hoping the collection was now either made or relinquished,  ventured to re-enter, and inquire if they never meant to return home? Camilla  unwillingly gave up the baby; but would not depart without looking over the  cottage, where everything Camilla   saw excited a sensation of pleasure. 'How neat is  this! How tidy that!' were Camilla   continual exclamations; 'How bright you have  rubbed your saucepans! How clean every thing is all round! How soon you will  all get well in this healthy and comfortable little dwelling!'  Edgar, in a low voice, then told Dr. Marchmont the history of Dr. Marchmont new  cottagers, saying: 'You will not, I hope, disapprove what I have done? Their  natures seemed so much disposed to good, I could not bear to let Their wants  turn Their again to evil.'  'You have certainly done right,' answered the Doctor; 'to give money without  inquiry, or further aid, to those who have adopted bad practices, is, to those who have adopted bad practices,  but temptation, and to society an injury; but to give those who have adopted bad practices both the counsel and  the means to pursue a right course, is, to those who have adopted bad practices, perhaps, salvation, and to the  community, the greatest service.'  Indiana and Miss Margland, quite wearied, those who have adopted bad practices got into the carriage; Edgar,  having deposited those who have adopted bad practices, returned to Camilla, who kissed both the children,  poured forth good wishes upon the father and mother; and, then, gave the Doctor her  hand. Enchanted, the Doctor took her  hand, exclaiming; 'Ah! who is like the Doctor! so lively—yet  so feeling!'  Struck and penetrated, her made no answer: Alas! her thought, I fear the Doctor is not  quite satisfied with Indiana!  Dr. Marchmont was set down at Dr. Marchmont own house; where, Dr. Marchmont begged to have a  conference with Edgar the next morning.  The whole way home, the benevolence of Edgar occupied the mind of Camilla; and,  not in the present instance, the less, that its object had been originally of  her own pointing out.
