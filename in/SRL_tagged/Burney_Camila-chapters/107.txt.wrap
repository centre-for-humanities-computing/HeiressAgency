 The Progress of Dissipation  Mr. Clykes, by the promised payment and reward, being for the present appeased,  Camilla still admitted some hope of waiting a more favourable moment for her  cruel confession. She received, also, a little, though mournful, reprieve from  terror, by a letter from Lisbon, written to again postpone the return of Mrs.  Tyrold, at the earnest request of Mr. Relvil; and she flattered herself that,  before her arrival, she should be enabled to resume those only duties which  could draw her from despondence. She lived, meanwhile, wholly shut up from all  company, consigned to penitence for her indiscretions, to grief for the fate of  her sister, and to wasting regret of her own causelessly lost felicity.  Indiana smiled not more sweetly upon Melmond, for Miss Margland's advising her  to consider in time, whether the promises made by Miss Eugenia Tyrold would be  binding to Mrs. Bellamy. She saw, nevertheless, no good, she said, it could do  her cousin, that she should neglect such an opportunity of seeing London: and  Miss Margland, in aid of this desire, spared so much trouble to Mrs. Berlinton,  who soon wearied of Indiana, that she had the satisfaction of being invited to  remain in Grosvenor-square till the two young ladies returned into the country.  Mrs. Berlinton, who indulged, in full extent, every feeling, but investigated  none, had been piqued and hurt to extreme unhappiness at the late conduct of  Bellamy. Attracted by his fine person, and caught by the first flattery which  had talked to her of her own, she had easily been captivated by his description  of the sympathy which united, and penetrated by his lamentations at the destiny  which parted them. His request for her friendship had been the first  circumstance, after her marriage, which had given her any interest in life; and  soon, with the common effect of such dangerous expedients to while away  chagrin, had occupied all her thoughts, and made the rest of the universe seem  to her as a blank. But their continued separation from each other, made the day  soon too long for mere regret; and her pliant mind, in this state of vacancy,  had readily been bent to the new pursuit pressed upon her by Mrs. Norfield;  which, however, upon the re-appearance of Bellamy, would speedily have given  way to the resumption of his influence, had not his elopement with Eugenia left  her again all at large. It destroyed an illusion strong though not definable;  demolished a friendship ill conceived, and worse understood; and brought with  it a disappointment which confused all her ideas. To be inactive was, however,  impossible; simplicity, once given up, returned to the dissipated no more; or  returns but when experience brings conviction. That all is hollow where the  heart bears no part; all is peril where principle is not the guide.  The Faro Table was now re-opened, and again but too powerfully sharpened the  faculties which mortification had blunted. A company the most miscellaneous  composed her evening assemblies, which were soon, nevertheless, amongst the  most fashionable, as well as crowded of the metropolis. Whatever there, is new  and splendid, is sure of a run for at least a season. Enquiries into what is  right, or strictures upon what is wrong, rarely molest popularity, till the  rise of some fresher luminary gives fashion another abode.  Calamity requires not more fortitude than pleasure. What she began but to  divert disappointment and lassitude, she continued to attain celebrity; and the  company which Faro and Fashion brought together, she soon grew ambitious to  collect by motives of more appropriate flattery. All her aim, now, was to be  universally alluring; and she looked from object to object, in smiling  discourse, till one by one, every object could look only at her: and grace and  softness which had been secretly bewitching while she had the dignity to keep  admiration aloof, were boldly declared to be invincible, since she permitted  such professions to reach her ear.  Long surrounded by gazing admirers, she became now encircled by avowed adorers;  and what for victory she had essayed, she pursued ardently for pleasure.  Coquetry is as fascinating to those who practise it, as to those whom it  seduces; and she found herself, shortly, more happy by a conquest effected by  wiles and by art, than by any devotion paid straight forward, and uncourted.  The generality of her new ambition protected it from permanent ill  consequences; aiming at everyone, she cared for no one; mortified by Bellamy,  she resolved to mortify others, and in proportion as her smiles grew softer her  heart became harder.  Indiana, at this period, immersed at once from the most private retreat into  the gayest vortex of pleasure, thought herself in the upper regions, where  happiness, composed by her own ideas, consisted of perpetual admiration to  unfading beauty: but though the high qualities with which the devotion of  Melmond had gifted her had enslaved his reason and understanding from  suspecting that so fair a form could enclose aught short of its own perfection,  his heart was struck, and all his feelings were offended, when he saw her  capable of dissipation upon a season of calamity to Eugenia; Eugenia, whom  though he could not love, he venerated; Eugenia, whose nature he thought  divine, though her person, unhappily, was but too human; Eugenia, to whom he  owed the union upon which hung all his wishes ... to seek pleasure while  Eugenia suffered, was astonishing, was incomprehensible. He felt as if every  principle of his love were violated; he looked another way, to disguise his  shock;â€”but when he looked at her again, it was forgotten.  Camilla soon after learnt, from Lavinia, that Sir Hugh had been deeply affected  by the history of the elopement, though it had been softened to him by all  possible means, at the desire of the heroic Eugenia herself; who would now own  to no one the force with which she had been carried off. Bellamy continued the  most unremitting demonstrations of affection, which she received with  gentleness, and appeared entirely to credit as sincere; but he had already  absolutely refused a residence offered for them both at Cleves, and made  Eugenia herself ask a separate provision of her uncle, though she could not  even a moment pretend that the desire was her own. Sir Hugh, nevertheless, had  yielded; and notwithstanding his present embarrassments from Clermont, had  insisted upon settling a thousand pounds a year upon her immediately; in  consequence of which, Bellamy had instantly taken a house at Belfont, to which  they were already removing. Eugenia had recovered her gentle fortitude, seemed  to submit to her destiny, and repined solely she could not, yet, keep her  engagement with respect to the trinkets, which though she had openly told  Bellamy were promised to a friend, he had seized to pack up, and said, 'he  could not re-deliver till they were arranged in their new dwelling.' But she  charged Lavinia to express her hopes that the detention would not last long.  When the given three weeks expired, Indiana, infatuated with London, begged and  obtained leave to stretch her residence there to a month.  Eugenia was now settled at Belfont; but still Camilla received no intelligence  of the promised boon, and spent her lingering hours in her chamber, no longer  even invited thence, except at meals, by Mrs. Berlinton; whose extreme and  encreasing dissipation, from first allowing no time, took off, next, all desire  for social life. Surprised and hurt, Camilla was called off a little from  herself, through concern. She sincerely loved Mrs. Berlinton, whom it was  difficult to see and know with indifference, and she softly represented to her  how ill she felt at ease in the falling off she experienced in her partiality.  Mrs. Berlinton tenderly embraced her, protesting she was dear to her as ever;  and feeling, while she spoke, her first affection return; but not a moment had  she to bestow from her new mode of life: some party was always formed which she  had not force of mind to break; an internal restlessness, from the want of some  right pursuit, joined to a disappointment she could not own, made that party  induce another; and though none gave her real pleasure, which her strong,  however undisciplined and unguided feelings, shut out from such a species of  vague life, all gave employment to expectation, and were preferable to a regret  at once consuming and mortifying.  Her gentleness, however, and her returned personal kindness, encouraged Camilla  to repeat her admonitions, and engage assistance from Melmond, who, at any  other period, would, uncalled, have given his whole attention to a sister dear  at once to his honour and his heart; but Indiana more than occupied, she  engrossed him. She now expected an adoration so unremitting, that if she  surprised his eyes turned any other way even a moment, she reproached him with  abated love, and it was the business of a day to obtain a reconciliation.  Gratefully, however, at the instigation of Camilla, he resumed the vigilance  with which, upon her first entering London the preceding year, he had attended  to all the actions of his sister. But the difference already produced by the  effect of flattery, the hardening of example, and the sway of uncontrolled  early power, astonished and alarmed him. At her first setting out, she had  hearkened to all counsel, frightened by every representation of danger, and  humbled by every remonstrance against impropriety. But she now heard him with  little or no emotion; and from beginning to listen unmoved, soon proceeded to  reply and resist. A search, rather than a love, of pleasure had seized her  young mind, which had now gained an ascendant that rendered contest less  shocking, than yielding would have been painful.  The tribulation of Melmond at this ill success, rested not solely upon his  sister; he saw yet more danger for Indiana, who now seemed scarce to live but  while arraying, or displaying herself. His passion had lost its novelty, and  her eyes lost their beaming pleasure in listening to it; and the regard he had  fondly expected to take place of first ecstacy, he now found unattainable, from  want of all materials for its structure. His discourse, when not of her beauty,  but strained her faculties; his reading, when compelled to hear it, but wearied  her intellects. She had no genius to catch his meaning, and no attention to  supply its place.  Deeply he now thought of Eugenia, with that regret ever attached to frail  humanity, for what is removed from possible possession. The purity of her love,  the cultivation of her mind, and the nobleness of her sentiments, now bore  forth a contrast to the general mental and intellectual littleness of Indiana,  which made him blame the fastidious eyes that could dwell upon her face and  form; and feel that, even with the matchless Indiana, he must sigh at their  mutual perversity of fate.  Nor missed he more in soul, than Indiana in adoration, who turned from what she  now resented as coldness, to the violent praises of Macdersey, who became, at  this period, a frequenter of Mrs. Berlinton's assemblies. She understood not  the inevitable difference of the altered situation; that he who was accepted  might be grateful, but could not be anxious; and that Melmond, while in  suspense, wore the same impassioned air, and spoke the same impassioned  feelings as Macdersey. To her, all seemed the change not from doubt to  security, but from love to insensibility.  To live always at her feet, while he thought her all-divine, was his own first  joy and greatest pride: but when once he found his goddess had every mortal  imperfection, his homage ceased, with amazement that ever it could have been  excited. Those eyes, thought he, which I have gazed at whole days with such  unreflecting admiration; and whose shape, colour, size, and sweet proportion  still hold their pre-eminence, now, while retaining their first lustre, have  lost all their illusory charm! I meet themâ€”but to deplore their vacancy of  the soul's intelligenceâ€”I fondlyâ€”vainly seek!  Even when again the time arrived for returning to Cleves, Indiana, hanging  languidly upon every minute she could steal from it, petitioned for a few days  more from the ever-granting Baronet, which, while by her devoted to coquetry,  admiration, and dress, were consumed by Camilla in almost every species of  wretchedness. Mrs. Mittin wrote her word that Mr. Clykes was become more uneasy  than ever for his money, as she had thought it indispensable to acquaint him of  the reports in the neighbourhood, that Mr. Tyrold had met with misfortunes, and  was retrenching: if he could not, therefore, be paid quickly, he must put in  his claims elsewhere.  The same post brought from Lavinia an account so afflicting of Eugenia, as  nearly to annihilate even this deep personal distress. It was known, through  Molly Mill, who, by the express insistance of Sir Hugh, continued to live with  her young Mistress, that Bellamy had already, at Belfont, cast off the mask of  pretended passion, and grossly demanded of her Mistress to beg money for him of  Sir Hugh; acknowledging, without scruple, large debts, that demanded speedy  payment, and pressing her to ask for the immediate possession of the Yorkshire  estate. Her Mistress, though mildly, always steadily refused; which occasioned  reproaches so rude and violent as almost to frighten her into fits; and so  loud, that they were often heard by every servant in the house.  Camilla, at this dreadful history, grew nearly indifferent to all else, and  would have relinquished, almost unrepining, her expectations of personal  relief, but that Lavinia, in the name of their unhappy sister, bid her still  cherish them; assuring her she hoped yet to perform her engagement, as Mr.  Bellamy never disputed her already given promise, though he had mislaid the key  of the box in which the trinkets were deposited.  Nor even here rested the misery of Camilla: another alarm stole upon her mind,  of a nature the most dreadful.  Upon the first evening of this newly-granted stay, while she was conversing  alone with Mrs. Berlinton before the nocturnal toilette of that lady, a servant  announced Mr. Bellamy. Mrs. Berlinton blushed high, evidently with as much of  anger as surprise; Camilla hastily withdrawing, to avoid an object abhorrent to  her, wondered she would admit him: yet, anxious for any intelligence that could  relate to her sister, enquired when he was gone, and ran towards the  dressing-room to ask what had passed: but before she reached the door, the  sound of his voice re-entering the hall, and of his step re-ascending the  stairs, made her fly into the adjoining apartment, not to encounter him; where  the instant he had shut the door, and before she could move, she heard him  exclaim, 'You weep still, my lovely friend? Ah! can one doubt so injurious  remain upon your mind as to suppose any thing but the cruel necessity of my  misfortunes could have made me tarnish our celestial friendship with any other  engagement? Ah! look at her ... and look at yourself!'  Camilla, who, at first, had been immoveable from consternation, now recovered  sufficiently to get back to her room. But she returned no more to Mrs.  Berlinton, though Bellamy soon departed; her eagerness for information subsided  in indignant sorrow. That Eugenia, the injured, the inestimable Eugenia, should  be spoken of, by the very violator who had torn her from her friends, as a mere  burthen attached to the wealth she procured him, struck at her heart as a  poniard. And the impropriety to herself, and the wrong to Eugenia, of Mrs.  Berlinton, in listening to such a discourse, totally sunk that lady in her  esteem; though it determined her, as a duty due to them all around, to  represent what she felt upon this subject; and the next day, the instant she  was visible, she begged an audience.  Mrs. Berlinton was pensive and dejected, but, as usual, open and unguarded; she  began herself to speak of the visit of Bellamy, and to ask why she ran away.  Camilla, without answer or hesitation, related what she had overheard; adding:  'O, Mrs. Berlinton! can you suffer him to talk thus? Can you think of my  injured Eugeniaâ€”lately your own favourite friendâ€”and bear to hear him?'  'How injured, my ever-dear Camilla? Does she know what he says? Can it hurt her  unheard? Can it affect her unimagined? He but solaces his sadness by a  confidence he holds sacred; 'tis the type of our friendship, now dearer, he  says, than ever, since reciprocated by such sympathy.'  'You affright me, Mrs. Berlinton! what a perversion of reason to talk of  sympathy in your situations? Did Eugenia press him to the altar? Did any  friends solicit the alliance? Oh, Mrs. Berlinton! think but a moment, and your  own feeling mind will paint his conduct in colours I have not the skill to  attain!'  'You are right!' cried she, blushing in her unwilling conviction: 'I know not  how he could delude me to believe our fates resembled. Certainly nothing can be  less similar.'  Camilla was happy in this victory; but the following day, Bellamy, at the same  hour was announced, and in the same manner was admitted; Camilla flying, and  Mrs. Berlinton protesting she should attack his mistaken comparison with  severity.  Severity, however, was a quality with which she was unacquainted; Camilla,  anxious in every way, hastened to her when he was gone, but found her dissolved  in tender tears, shed, she declared, in regret of the uneasiness she had given  him, for he had now made her fully sensible his destiny alone was to blame.  The understanding of Camilla was highly superior to being duped by such flimsy  sophistry, which she heard with added detestation of the character of Bellamy;  yet perceived that no remonstrance could prevent his admittance, and that every  interview regularly destroyed the effect of every exhortation.  In this melancholy period, the sole satisfaction she received was through a  letter written by Lionel from Ostend, in which he told her that the dread of  imprisonment, or want, in a foreign country, made him lead a life so  parsimonious, so totally deprived of all pleasure and all comfort, that he was  almost consumed with regret for the wilfulness with which he had thrown away  his innumerable advantages; and so much struck with the retrospection of the  wanton follies and vices which had involved him in such dishonour and ruin,  that he began now to think he had rather been mad than wicked;â€”so unmeaning,  unreflecting, and unprovoked, as well as worthless, had been the course he had  pursued.  Camilla sent this letter immediately to her Father, who remitted to Lionel such  a sum as must obviate distress, with such intimation for the future as he hoped  would best encourage more solid reformation.  Thus passed the time, improperly, or unhappily to all, till the third period  fixed for the return to the country elapsed: and Camilla, finding the whole  view of her journey abortive, saw the accumulated yet useless suffering  involved through her ill-judged procrastination. Yet, as Eugenia still did not  despair, even her confession was unwritten; and as Miss Margland and Indiana  granted her request of going round by Belfont, which she had previously  arranged from an ardent desire to embrace her loved sister, she still dwelt on  a last hope from that interview.
