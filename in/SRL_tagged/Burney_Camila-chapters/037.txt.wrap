 Specimens of Taste  The presence of Lionel stifled the enquiries of Eugenia; and pride, all up in  arms, absorbed every softer feeling in Camilla.  When they had driven half a mile, 'Now, young ladies,' said he, 'I shall treat  you with a frolic.' He then stopt the carriage, and told the coachman to drive  to Cornfield; saying, 'Tis but two miles about, and Coachy won't mind that;  will you Coachy?'  The coachman, looking forward to half a crown, said his horses would be all the  better for a little more exercise; and Jacob, familiarly fond of Lionel from a  boy, made no difficulty.  Lionel desired his sisters to ask no questions, assuring them he had great  designs, and a most agreeable surprise in view for them.  In pursuance of his directions, they drove on till they came before a small  house, just new fronted with deep red bricks, containing, on the ground floor,  two little bow windows, in a sharp triangular form, enclosing a door ornamented  with small panes of glass, cut in various shapes; on the first story, a little  balcony, decorated in the middle and at each corner with leaden images of  Cupids; and, in the attic story, a very small venetian window, partly formed  with minute panes of glass, and partly with glazed tiles; representing, in blue  and white, various devices of dogs and cats, mice and birds, rats and ferrets,  as emblems of the conjugal state.  'Well, young ladies, what say you to this?' cried he, 'does it hit your fancy?  If it does, 'tis your own!'  Eugenia asked what he meant.  'Mean? to make a present of it to which ever is the best girl, and can first  cry bo! to a goose. Come, don't look disdainfully. Eugenia, what say you? won't  it be better to be mistress of this little neat, tight, snug box, and a pretty  little tidy husband, that belongs to it, than to pore all day long over a Latin  theme with old Dr. Orkborne? I have often thought my poor uncle was certainly  out of his wits, when he set us all, men, women, and children, to learn Latin,  or else be whipt by the old doctor. But we all soon got our necks out of the  collar, except poor Eugenia, and she's had to work for us all. However, here's  an opportunity—see but what a pretty place—not quite finished, to be sure,  but look at that lake? how cool, how rural, how refreshing!'  'Lake?' repeated Eugenia, 'I see nothing but a very dirty little pond, with a  mass of rubbish in the middle. Indeed I see nothing else but rubbish all round,  and every where.'  'That's the very beauty of the thing, my dear; it's all in the exact state for  being finished under your own eye, and according to your own taste.'  'To whom does it belong?'  'It's uninhabited yet; but it's preparing for a very spruce young spark, that I  advise you both to set your caps at. Hold! I see somebody peeping; I'll go and  get some news for you.'  He then jumped from the coach, and ran up five deep narrow steps, formed of  single large rough stones, which mounted so much above the threshold of the  house, that upon opening the door, there appeared a stool to assist all comers  to reach the floor of the passage.  Eugenia, with some curiosity, looked out, and saw her brother, after nearly  forcing his entrance, speak to a very mean little man, dressed in old dirty  cloaths, who seemed willing to hide himself behind the door, but whom he almost  dragged forward, saying aloud, 'O, I can take no excuse, I insist upon your  shewing the house. I have brought two young ladies on purpose to see it; and  who knows but one of them may take a fancy to it, and make you a happy man for  life.'  'As to that, sir,' said the man, still endeavouring to retreat, 'I can't say as  I've quite made my mind up yet as to the marriage ceremony. I've known partly  enough of the state already; but if ever I marry again, which is a moot point,  I sha'n't do it hand over head, like a boy, without knowing what I'm about.  However, it's time enough o'conscience to think of that, when my house is done,  and my workmen is off my hands.'  Camilla now, by the language and the voice, gathered that this was Mr. Dubster.  'Pho, pho,' answered Lionel, 'you must not be so hard-hearted when fair ladies  are in the case. Besides, one of them is that pretty girl you flirted with at  Northwick. She's a sister of mine, and I shall take it very ill if you don't  hand her out of the coach, and do the honours of your place to her.'  Camilla, much provoked, earnestly called to her brother, but utterly in vain.  'Lauk-a-day! why it is not half finished,' said Mr. Dubster; 'nor a quarter  neither: and as to that young lady, I can't say as it was much in my mind to be  over civil to her any more, begging pardon, after her giving me the slip in  that manner. I can't say as I think it was over and above handsome, letting me  get my gloves. Not that I mind it in the least, as to that.'  'Pho, pho, man, you must never bear malice against a fair lady. Besides, she's  come now on purpose to make her excuses.'  'O, that's another thing; if the young lady's sorry, I sha'n't think of holding  out. Besides, I can't say but what I thought her agreeable enough, if it had  not been for her behaving so comical just at the last. Not that I mean in the  least to make any complaint, by way of getting of the young lady scolded.'  'You must make friends now, man, and think no more of it;' cried Lionel, who  would have drawn him to the carriage; but he protested he was quite ashamed to  be seen in such a dishabille, and should go first and dress himself. Lionel, on  the contrary, declaring nothing so manly, nor so becoming, as a neglect of  outward appearance, pulled him to the coach door, notwithstanding all his  efforts to disengage himself, and the most bashful distortions with which he  strove to sneak behind his conductor.  'Ladies,' said he, 'Mr. Dubster desires to have the honour of walking over his  house and grounds with you.'  Camilla declared she had no time to alight; but Lionel insisted, and soon  forced them both from the coach.  Mr. Dubster, no longer stiff, starched, and proud, as when full dressed, was  sunk into the smallest insignificance; and when they were compelled to enter  his grounds, through a small Chinese gate, painted of a deep blue, would  entirely have kept out of sight; but for a whisper from Lionel, that the ladies  had owned they thought he looked to particular advantage in that careless  attire.  Encouraged by this, he came boldly forward, and suddenly facing them, made a  low bow saying: 'Young ladies, your humble.'  They courtsied slightly, and Camilla said she was very sorry to break in upon  him.  'O, it don't much matter,' cried he, extremely pleased by this civility, 'I  only hope, young ladies, you won't take umbrage at my receiving you in this  pickle; but you've popt upon me unawares, as one may say. And my best coat is  at this very minute at Tom Hicks's, nicely packed and papered up, and tied all  round, in a drawer of his, up stairs, in his room. And I'd have gone for it  with the greatest pleasure in life, to shew my respect, if the young gentleman  would have let me.'  And then, recollecting Eugenia, 'Good lauk, ma'am,' said he, in a low voice to  Camilla, 'that's that same lame little lady as I saw at the ball?'  'That lady, sir,' answered she, provoked, 'is my sister.'  'Mercy's me!' exclaimed he, lifting up his hands, 'I wish I'd known as much at  the time. I'm sure, ma'am, if I'd thought the young lady was any ways related  to you, I would not have said a word disrespectful upon no account.'  Lionel asked how long he had had this place.  'Only a little while. I happened of it quite lucky. A friend of mine was just  being turned out of it, in default of payment, and so I got it a bargain. I  intend to fit it up a little in taste, and then, whether I like it or no, I can  always let it.'  They were now, by Lionel, dragged into the house, which was yet unfurnished,  half papered, and half white washed. The workmen, Mr. Dubster said, were just  gone to dinner, and he rejoiced that they had happened to come so conveniently,  when he should be no loser by leaving the men to themselves, in order to oblige  the young ladies with his company.  He insisted upon shewing them not only every room, but every closet, every  cupboard, every nook, corner, and hiding place; praising their utility, and  enumerating all their possible appropriations, with the most minute encomiums.  'But I'm quite sorry,' cried he, 'young ladies, to think as I've nothing to  offer you. I eats my dinner always at the Globe, having nobody here to cook.  However I'd have had a morsel of cake or so, if the young gentleman had been so  kind as to give me an item beforehand of your intending me the favour. But as  to getting things into the house hap hazard, really everything is so  dear—it's quite out of reason.'  The scampering of horses now carrying them to a window, they saw some hounds in  full cry, followed by horse-men in full gallop. Lionel declared he would borrow  Jacob's mare, and join them, while his sisters walked about the grounds: but  Camilla, taking him aside, made a serious expostulation, protesting that her  father, with all his indulgence, and even her uncle himself, would be certainly  displeased, if he left them alone with this man; of whom they knew nothing but  his very low trade.  'Why what is his trade?'  'A tinker's: Mrs. Arlbery told me so.'  He laughed violently at this information, protesting he was rejoiced to find so  much money could be made by the tinkering business, which he was determined to  follow in his next distress for cash: yet added, he feared this was only the  malice of Mrs. Arlbery, for Dubster, he had been told, had kept a shop for  ready made wigs.  He gave up, however, his project, forgetting the chace when he no longer heard  the hounds, and desired Mr. Dubster to proceed in shewing his lions?  'Lauk a day! sir, I've got no lions, nor tygers neither. It's a deal of expence  keeping them animals; and though I know they reckon me near, I sha'n't do no  such thing; for if a man does not take a little care of his money when once he  has got it, especially if it's honestly, I think he's a fool for his pains;  begging pardon for speaking my mind so freely.'  He then led them again to the front of the house, where he desired they would  look at his pond. 'This,' said he, 'is what I value the most of all, except my  summer house and my labyrinth. I shall stock it well; and many a good dinner I  hope to eat from it. It gets me an appetite, sometimes, I think, only to look  at it.'  ''Tis a beautiful piece of water,' said Lionel, 'and may be useful to the  outside as well as the inside, for, if you go in head foremost, you may bathe  as well as feed from it.'  'No, I sha'n't do that, sir, I'm not over and above fond of water at best.  However, I shall have a swan.'  'A swan? why sure you won't be contented with only one?'  'O yes, I shall. It will only be made of wood, painted over in white. There's  no end of feeding them things if one has 'em alive. Besides it will look just  as pretty; and won't bite. And I know a friend of mine that one of them  creatures flew at, and gave him such a bang as almost broke his leg, only for  throwing a stone at it, out of mere play. They are mortal spiteful, if you  happen to hurt them when you're in their reach.'  He then begged them to go over to his island, which proved to be what Eugenia  had taken for a mass of rubbish. They would fain have been excused crossing a  plank which he called a bridge, but Lionel would not be denied.  'Now here,' said he, 'when my island's finished, I shall have something these  young ladies will like; and that's a lamb.'  'Alive, or dead?' cried Lionel.  'Alive,' he replied, 'for I shall have good pasture in a little bit of ground  just by, where I shall keep me a cow; and here will be grass enough upon my  island to keep it from starving on Sundays, and for now and then, when I've  somebody come to see me. And when it's fit for killing, I can change it with  the farmer down the lane, for another young one, by a bargain I've agreed with  him for already; for I don't love to run no risks about a thing for mere  pleasure.'  'Your place will be quite a paradise,' said Lionel.  'Why, indeed, sir, I think I've earned having a little recreeting, for I worked  hard enough for it, before I happened of meeting with my first wife.'  'O, ho! so you began with marrying a fortune?'  'Yes, sir, and very pretty she was too, if she had not been so puny. But she  was always ailing. She cost me a mort of money to the potecary before she went  off. And she was a tedious while a dying, poor soul!'  'Your first wife? surely you have not been twice married already?'  'Yes, I have. My second wife brought me a very pretty fortune too. I can't say  but I've rather had the luck of it, as far as I've gone yet awhile.'  They now repassed the plank, and were conducted to an angle, in which a bench  was placed close to the chinese rails, which was somewhat shaded by a willow,  that grew in a little piece of stagnant water on the other side. A syringa was  planted in front, and a broom-tree on the right united it with the willow; in  the middle there was a deal table.  'Now, young ladies,' said Mr. Dubster, 'if you have a taste to breathe a little  fresh country air, here's where I advise you to take your rest. When I come to  this place first, my arbour, as I call this, had no look out, but just to the  fields, so I cut away them lilacs, and now there's a good pretty look out. And  it's a thing not to be believed what a sight of people and coaches, and  gentlemen's whiskeys and stages, and flys, and wagons, and all sorts of things  as ever you can think of, goes by all day long. I often think people's got but  little to do at home.'  Next, he desired to lead them to his grotto, which he said was but just begun.  It was, indeed, as yet, nothing but a little square hole, dug into a chalky  soil, down into which, no steps being yet made, he slid as well as he could, to  the no small whitening of his old brown coat, which already was thread bare.  He begged the ladies to follow, that he might shew them the devices he had  marked out with his own hand, and from his own head, for fitting up the inside.  Lionel would not suffer his sisters to refuse compliance, though Mr. Dubster  himself cautioned them to come carefully, 'in particular,' he said, 'the little  lady, as she has happened of an ugly accident already, as I judge, in one of  her hips, and 'twould be pity, at her time of life, if she should happen of  another at t'other side.'  Eugenia, not aware this misfortune was so glaring, felt much hurt by this  speech; and Camilla, very angry with its speaker, sought to silence him by a  resentful look; but not observing it; 'Pray, ma'am,' he continued, 'was it a  fall? or was you born so?'  Eugenia looked struck and surprized; and Camilla hastily whispered it was a  fall, and bid him say no more about it; but, not understanding her, 'I take it,  then,' he said, 'that was what stinted your growth so, Miss? for, I take it,  you're not much above the dwarf as they shew at Exeter Change? Much of a  muchness, I guess. Did you ever see him, ma'am?'  'No, sir.'  'It would be a good sight enough to see you together. He'd think himself a man  in a minute. You must have had the small pox mortal bad, ma'am. I suppose you'd  the conflint sort?'  Camilla here, without waiting for help, slid down into the intended grotto, and  asked a thousand questions to change the subject; while Eugenia, much  disconcerted, slowly followed, aided by Lionel.  Mr. Dubster then displayed the ingenious intermixture of circles and diamonds  projected for the embellishment of his grotto; the first of which were to be  formed with cockle-shells, which he meant to colour with blue paint; and the  second he proposed shaping with bits of shining black coal. The spaces between  would each have an oyster-shell in the middle, and here and there he designed  to leave the chalk to itself, which would always, he observed, make the grotto  light and cheery. Shells he said, unluckily, he did not happen to have; but as  he had thoughts of taking a little pleasure some summer at Brighthelmstone or  Margate, for he intended to see all those places, he should make a collection  then; being told he might have as curious shells, and pebbles too, as a man  could wish to look at, only for the trouble of picking them up off the shore.  They next went to what he called his labyrinth, which was a little walk he was  cutting, zig-zag, through some brushwood, so low that no person above three  foot height could be hid by it. Every step they took here, cost a rent to some  lace or some muslin of one of the sisters; which Mr. Dubster observed with a  delight he could not conceal; saying this was a true country walk, and would do  them both a great deal of good; and adding: 'we that live in town, would give  our ears for such a thing as this.' And though they could never proceed a yard  at a time, from the continual necessity of disentangling their dress from  thorns and briars, he exultingly boasted that he should give them a good  appetite for their dinner; and asked if this rural ramble did not make them  begin to feel hungry. 'For my part,' continued he, 'if once I get settled a  bit, I shall take a turn in this zig-zag every day before dinner, which may  save me my five grains of rhubarb, that the doctor ordered me for my stomach,  since my having my illness, which come upon me almost as soon as I was a  gentleman; from change of life, I believe, for I never knew no other reason;  and none of the doctors could tell me nothing about it. But a man that's had a  deal to do, feels quite unked at first, when he's only got to look and stare  about him, and just walk from one room to another, without no employment.'  Lionel said he hoped, at least, he would not require his rhubarb to get down  his dinner to day.  'I hope so too, 'squire,' answered he, licking his lips, 'for I've ordered a  pretty good one, I can tell you; beef steaks and onions; and I don't know  what's better. Tom Hicks is to dine with me at the Globe, as soon as I've give  my workmen their tasks, and seen after a young lad that's to do me a job there,  by my grotto. Tom Hicks is a very good fellow; I like him best of any  acquaintance I've made in these here parts. Indeed, I've made no other, on  account of the unconvenience of dressing, while I'm so much about with my  workmen. So I keep pretty incog from the genteel; and Tom does well enough in  the interim.'  He then requested them to make haste to his summer-house, because his workmen  would be soon returned, and he could not then spare a moment longer, without  spoiling his own dinner.  'My summer-house,' said he, 'is not above half complete yet; but it will be  very pretty when it's done. Only I've got no stairs yet to it; but there's a  very good ladder, if the ladies a'n't afraid.'  The ladies both desired to be excused mounting; but Lionel protested he would  not have his friend affronted; and as neither of them were in the habit of  resisting him, nor of investigating with seriousness any thing that he  proposed, they were soon teized into acquiescence, and he assisted them to  ascend.  Mr. Dubster followed.  The summer-house was, as yet, no more than a shell; without windows, scarcely  roofed, and composed of lath and plaister, not half dry. It looked on to the  high road, and Mr. Dubster assured them, that, on market days, the people  passed so thick, there was no seeing them for the dust.  Here they had soon cause to repent their facility,—that dangerous, yet  venial, because natural fault of youth;—for hardly had they entered this  place, ere a distant glimpse of a fleet stag, and a party of sportsmen, incited  Lionel to scamper down; and calling out: 'I shall be back presently,' he made  off towards the house, dragging the ladder after him.  The sisters eagerly and almost angrily remonstrated; but to no purpose; and  while they were still entreating him to return and supposing him, though out of  sight, within hearing, they suddenly perceived him passing the window by the  high road, on horse-back, switch in hand, and looking in the utmost glee. 'I  have borrowed Jacob's mare,' he cried, 'for just half an hour's sport, and sent  Jacob and Coachy to get a little refreshment at the next public house; but  don't be impatient; I shan't be long.'  Off then, he galloped, laughing; in defiance of the serious entreaties of his  sisters, and without staying to hear even one sentence of the formal  exhortations of Mr. Dubster.
