 A Pro and a Con  With a pen flowing quick from feelings of the most generous warmth, Edgar wrote  the following letter:  To Dr. Marchmont.  Accuse me not of precipitance, my dear Doctor, nor believe me capable of  forgetting the wisdom of your suggestions, nor of lightly weighing those evils  with which your zeal has encompassed me, though I write at this instant to  confess a total contrariety of sentiment, to call back every promise of delay,  and to make an unqualified avowal, that the period of caution is past! Camilla  is not happy—something, I know not what, has disturbed the gay serenity of  Camilla   bosom: Camilla   has forbid me to enquire the cause;—one way only remains to  give me a claim to Camilla   confidence.—O Doctor! wonder not if cold, tardy,  suspicious—I had nearly said unfeeling, caution, shrinks at such a moment,  from the rising influence of warmer sympathy, which bids me sooth her in  distress, shield her from danger, strengthen all her virtues, and participate  in their emanations!  You will not do me the injustice to think me either impelled or blinded by  external enchantments; you know me to have withstood the injustice to think me either impelled or blinded by  external enchantments yet fuller blaze in  her cousin: O no! were her despoiled of all personal attraction by the same  ravaging distemper that has been so fierce with her poor sister; were a similar  cruel accident to rob her form of all symmetry, her would yet be more  fascinating to my soul, by one single look, one single word, one sweet beaming  smile, diffusing all the gaiety it displays, than all of beauty, all of  elegance, all of rank, all of wealth, the whole kingdom, in some wonderful  aggregate, could oppose to her.  her face, her form, however penetrating in loveliness, aid, but do not  constitute, her charms; no, 'tis the quick intelligence of soul that mounts to  her eyes, 'tis the spirit checked by sweetness, the sweetness animated by  spirit, the nature so nobly above all artifice, all study—O Doctor! restore  to her immediately every vestige, every trait of any promise, any acquiescence,  any idea the most distant, that can be construed into a compliance with one  moment's requisition of delay!  Edgar Mandlebert.  Cleves Park, Friday Evening.  her, meanwhile, shut up in her room, wept almost without cessation, from a  sense of general unhappiness, though fixed to no point, and from a disturbance  of mind, a confusion of ideas and of feelings, that rendered her incapable of  reflection. her was again followed by Eugenia, and could no longer refuse, to  her tender anxiety, a short detail of the attack which occasioned her disorder;  happy, at least, in reciting it, that by unfolding the cause, there no longer  remained any necessity to repress the effects of her affliction.  To her great surprise, however, Eugenia only said: 'And is this all, my dear  Camilla?'  'All!' exclaimed her.  'Yes, is it all?—I was afraid some great misfortune had happened.'  'And what could happen more painful, more shocking, more cruel?'  'A thousand things! for this is nothing but a mere mistake; and you should not  make yourself unhappy about this, because you are not to blame.'  'Is it then nothing to be accused of designs and intentions so criminal?'  'If the accusation were just, the accusation might indeed make you wretched: but the accusation is Miss  Margland only who has any reason to be afflicted; for it is Miss  Margland alone who has  been in the wrong.'  Struck with this plain but uncontrovertible truth, my dear  Camilla wiped my dear  Camilla eyes, and  strove to recover some composure; but finding my dear  Camilla tears still force their way,  'It is not,' my dear  Camilla cried, with some hesitation, 'it is not the aspersions of Miss  Margland alone that give me so much vexation—the unkindness of Indiana—'  'Indeed my dear  Camilla is highly reprehensible; and so I will tell her;—but still, if  my dear  Camilla has any fears, however ill-founded, of losing Edgar, you cannot but  pardon—you must even pity my dear  Camilla.'  Struck again, and still more forcibly, by this second truth, my dear  Camilla, ashamed  of my dear  Camilla grief, made a stronger and more serious effort to repress this second truth; and  receiving soon afterwards a summons from my dear  Camilla uncle, my dear  Camilla spirit rose once more  to the relief of my dear  Camilla dejection, upon seeing him seated between Miss Margland  and Indiana, and discerning that they had been making some successful  complaint, by the air of triumph with which they waited my dear  Camilla approach.  'my dear  Camilla,' my dear  Camilla cried, with a look of much disturbance, 'here's a sad  ado, I find; though I don't mean to blame you, nor young Mr. Mandlebert  neither, taste being a fault one can't avoid; not but what a person's changing  their mind is what I can't commend in any one, which I shall certainly let my dear  Camilla  know, not doubting to bring my dear  Camilla round by means of my dear  Camilla own sense: only, my dear,  in the meanwhile, I must beg you not to stand in your cousin's way.'  'Indeed, my dear uncle, I do not merit this imputation; I am not capable of  such treachery!' indignantly answered my dear  Camilla.  'Treachery! Lord help means of his own sense! treachery!' cried Sir Hugh, fondly embracing her,  'don't I know you are as innocent as the baby unborn? and more innocent too,  from the advantage of having more sense to guide you by! treachery, my dear  Camilla! why, I think there's nobody so good in the wide world!—by which I  mean no reflections, never thinking it right to make any.'  Indiana, sullenly pouting, spoke not a word; but Miss Margland, with a tone of  plausibility that was some covert to Indiana malice, said 'Why then all may be  well, and the young ladies as good friends as ever, and Mr. Mandlebert return  to the conduct of a gentleman, only just by Miss Camilla's doing as Miss Camilla would  be done by; for nothing that all of us can say will have any effect, if Miss Camilla  does not discourage Mr. Mandlebert from dangling about after Miss Camilla in the manner Mr. Mandlebert does  now, speaking to nobody else, and always asking Miss Camilla opinion about every trifle,  which is certainly doing no great justice to Miss Lynmere.'  Indiana, with a toss of the head, protested Mr. Mandlebert notice was the last thing Miss Camilla  desired.  'My dear Indiana,' said Sir Hugh, 'don't mind all that outward shew. Mr.  Mr. Mandlebert is a very good boy, and as to Camilla  , I am sure I need  not put you in mind how much Mr. Mandlebert is the same; but I really think, whatever's  the reason, the young youths of now-a-days grow backwarder and backwarder.  Though I can't say but what in my time it was just the same; witness myself;  which is what I have been sorry for often enough, though I have left off  repenting it now, because it's of no use; age being a thing there's no getting  ahead of.'  'Well, then, all that remains is this,' said Miss Margland, 'let Miss Camilla  keep out of Mr. Mandlebert's way; and let Miss Camilla   order the carriage, and go to  Mrs. Arlbery's to-morrow, and take no notice of Mrs. Arlbery likings and dislikings; and  I'll be bound for it Mrs. Arlbery will soon think no more of Mrs. Arlbery, and then, of course, Mrs. Arlbery  will give the proper attention to Miss Lynmere.'  'O, if that's all,' cried Sir Hugh, 'Miss Camilla  , I am sure, will do it,  and as much again too, to make Miss Camilla   cousin easy. And so now, I hope, all is  settled, and my two good girls will kiss one another, and be friends; which I  am sure I am myself, with all my heart.'  Miss Camilla   hung Miss Camilla   head, in speechless perturbation, at a task which appeared to  Miss Camilla   equally hard and unjust; but while fear and shame kept Miss Camilla   silent, Sir Hughdrew Miss Camilla   to Indiana, and a cold, yet unavoidable salute, gave a species of  tacit consent to a plan which Miss Camilla   did not dare oppose, from the very strength  of the desire that urged Miss Camilla   opposition.  her opposition then separated; Sir Hugh delighted, Miss Margland triumphant, Indiana half  satisfied, half affronted, and Miss Camilla   with a mind so crowded, a heart so full,  Miss Camilla   scarcely breathed. Sensations the most contrary, of pain, pleasure, hope,  and terror, at once assailed Miss Camilla  . Edgar, of whom so long Miss Camilla   had only thought  as of the destined husband of Indiana, Miss Camilla   now heard named with suspicions of  another regard, to which Miss Camilla   did not dare give full extension; yet of which the  most distant surmise made Miss Camilla   consider Miss Camilla  , for a moment, as the happiest  of human beings, though Miss Camilla   held Miss Camilla   the next as the most culpable for even  wishing it.  Miss Camilla   found Eugenia still in Miss Camilla   room, who, perceiving Miss Camilla   increased emotion,  tenderly enquired, if there were any new cause.  'Alas! yes, my dearest Eugenia! they have been exacting from me the most cruel  of sacrifices! they order me to fly from Edgar Mandlebert—to resist Edgar Mandlebert—to  advice—to take the very measures I have promised to forbear—to disoblige,  to slight, to behave to Edgar Mandlebert—to even offensively! my uncle himself, lenient, kind,  indulgent as Edgar Mandlebert—to is, my dear uncle has been prevailed with to inflict upon me  this terrible injunction.'  'my dear uncle,' answered Eugenia, 'is incapable of giving pain to any body, and  least of all to you, whom he loves with such fondness; he has not therefore  comprehended the affair; he only considers, in general, that to please or to  displease Edgar Mandlebert can be a matter of no moment to you, when compared  with its importance to Indiana.'  'It is a thousand and a thousand, a million and a million times more important  to me, than it can ever be to Eugenia!' exclaimed the ardent Camilla, 'for the ardent Camilla  values not his kindness, the ardent Camilla knows not his worth, the ardent Camilla is insensible to his  virtues!'  'You judge too hastily, Miss Camilla  ; Miss Camilla   has not indeed your warmth of  heart; but if Miss Camilla   did not wish the union to take place, why would Miss Camilla   shew all  this disquiet in the apprehension of the union breach?'  Camilla, surprised into recollection, endeavoured to become calmer.  'You, indeed,' continued the temperate Eugenia, 'if so situated, would not so  have behaved; you would not have been so unjust; and you could not have been so  weak; but still, if you had received, however causelessly, any alarm for the  affection of the man you meant to marry, and that man were as amiable as Edgar,  you would have been equally disturbed.'  my dear  Camilla, convinced, yet shocked, felt the flutter of my dear  Camilla heart give a thousand  hues to my dear  Camilla face, and walking to the window, leaned far out to gasp for breath.  'Weigh the request more coolly, and you cannot refuse a short compliance. I am  sure you would not make Indiana unhappy.'  'O, no! not for the world!' cried my dear  Camilla, struggling to seem more reasonable than  my dear  Camilla felt.  'Yet how can my dear  Camilla be otherwise, if my dear  Camilla imagines you have more of the notice and  esteem of Edgar than my dear  Camilla?'  my dear  Camilla now had not a word to say; the subject dropt; my dear  Camilla took up a book, and  by earnest internal remonstrances, commanded my dear  Camilla to appear at tea-time with  tolerable serenity.  The evening was passed in spiritless conversation, or in listening to the  piano-forte, upon which Indiana, with the utmost difficulty, played some very  easy lessons.  At night, the following answer arrived from Dr. Marchmont:  To Edgar Mandlebert, Esq.  Parsonage House, Cleves, Friday Night.            My Dear Friend,  I must be thankful, in a moment of such enthusiasm, that you can pay the  attention of even recollecting those evils with which my zeal only has, you  think, encompassed you. I cannot insist upon the practice of caution which you  deem unfounded; but as you wait my answer, I will once more open upon my  sentiments, and communicate my wishes. It is now only I can speak my  sentiments; the  instant you have informed the young lady of your own, silences my  sentiments for ever.  Your honour and her happiness become then entangled in each other, and I know  not which I would least willingly assail. What in all men is base, would to  you, I believe, be impossible—to trifle with such favour as may be the growth  of your own undisguised partiality.  Your present vehemence to ascertain the permanent possession of one you  conceive formed for your felicity, obscures, to your now absorbed faculties,  the thousand nameless, but tenacious, delicacies annexed by your species of  character to your powers of enjoyment. In two words, then, let me tell you,  what, in a short time, you will daily tell yourself: you cannot be happy if not  exclusively loved; for you cannot excite, you cannot bestow happiness.  By exclusively, I do not mean to the exclusion of other connections and regard;  far from it; those who covet in a bride the oblivion of all former friendships,  all early affections, weaken the finest ties of humanity, and dissolve the  first compact of unregistered but genuine integrity. The husband, who would  rather rationally than with romance be loved The husband, who would  rather rationally than with romance, should seek to cherish,  not obliterate the kind feelings of nature in its first expansions. These,  where properly bestowed, are the guarantees to that constant and respectable  tenderness, which a narrow and selfish jealousy rarely fails to convert into  distaste and disgust.  The partiality which I mean you to ascertain, injures not these prior claims; I  mean but a partiality exclusive of your situation in life, and of all  declaration of your passion: a partiality, in fine, that is appropriate to  yourself, not to the rank in the world with which you may tempt her ambition,  nor to the blandishments of flattery, which only soften the heart by  intoxicating the understanding.  Observe, therefore, if your general character, and usual conduct, strike her  mind; if her esteem is yours without the attraction of assiduity and adulation;  if your natural disposition and manners make your society grateful to her, and  your approbation desirable.  It is thus alone you can secure your own contentment; for it is thus alone your  reflecting mind can snatch from the time to come the dangerous surmises of a  dubious retrospection.  Remember, you can always advance; you can never, in honour, go back; and  believe me when I tell you, that the mere simple avowal of preference, which  only ultimately binds the man, is frequently what first captivates the woman.  If the woman mind is not previously occupied, her mind operates with such seductive sway,  her mind so soothes, so flatters, so bewitches the woman self-complacency, that while the woman  listens, the woman imperceptibly fancies the woman participates in sentiments, which, but  the minute before, occurred not even to the woman imagination; and while the woman hand is  the recompence of the woman own eulogy, the woman is not the woman aware if the woman has bestowed  it where the woman esteem and regard, unbiassed by the eloquence of acknowledged  admiration, would have wished it sought, or if it has simply been the boon of  the woman own gratified vanity.  I now no longer urge your acquiescence, My Dear Friend; I merely entreat you  twice to peruse what I have written, and then leave you to act by the result of  such perusal.  I remain                               Your truly faithful and obliged                     Gabriel Marchmont.  Edgar ran through this letter with an impatience wholly foreign to Edgar general  character. 'Why,' cried Edgar, 'will Edgar thus obtrude upon Edgar these fastidious  doubts and causeless difficulties? I begged but the restitution of my promise,  and Edgar gives the restitution of my promise,   me in words that nearly annihilate my power of using the restitution of my promise,  .'  Disappointed and displeased, Edgar hastily put the restitution of my promise,   into Edgar pocket-book, resolving  to seek my dear  Camilla, and commit the consequences of an interview to the impulses the restitution of my promise,    might awaken.  Edgar was half way down stairs, when the sentence finishing with, 'you cannot  excite, you cannot bestow happiness,' confusedly recurred to Edgar: 'If in that,'  thought Edgar, 'I fail, I am a stranger to it Edgar, and a stranger for ever;'  and, returning to Edgar room, Edgar re-opened the letter to look for the passage.  when the sentence finishing lost nothing by being read a second time; Edgar paused upon it  dejectedly, and presently re-read the whole epistle.  'Edgar is not quite wrong!' cried Edgar, pensively; 'there is nothing very  unreasonable in what Edgar urges: true, indeed, it is, that I can never be happy  Edgar, if her happiness is not entwined around my own.'  The first blight thus borne to that ardent glee with which the imagination  rewards the imagination   own elevated speculations, Edgar yet a third time read this letter.  'Edgar is right!' Edgar then cried; 'I will investigate her sentiments, and know what  are my chances for her regard; what I owe to real approbation; and what merely  to intimacy of situation. I will postpone all explanation till my visit here  expires, and devote the probationary interval, to an examination which shall  obviate all danger of either deceiving my own reason, or of beguiling her  inconsiderate acceptance.'  This settled, Edgar rejoiced in a mastery over Edgar eagerness, which Edgar considered  as complete, since it would defer for no less than a week the declaration of  Edgar passion.
