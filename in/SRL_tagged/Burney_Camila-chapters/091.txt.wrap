 A Youthful Effusion  Camilla now thought herself safe in harbour; the storms all over, the dangers  all past, and but a light gale or two wanting to make good her landing on the  bosom of permanent repose. This gale, this propitious gale, she thought ready  to blow at her call; for she deemed it no other than the breath of jealousy.  She had seen Edgar, though he knew her to be protected, follow her to the  coach, and she had seen, by the light afforded from the lamps of the carriage,  that her safety from the crowd and tumult was not the sole object of his  watchfulness, since though that, at the instant she turned round, was obviously  secure, his countenance exhibited the strongest marks of disturbance. The  secret spring, therefore, she now thought, that was to re-unite them, was in  her own possession.  All the counsels of Mrs. Arlbery upon this subject occurred to her; and  imagining she had hitherto erred from a simple facility, she rejoiced in the  accident which had pointed her to a safer path, and shewn her that, in the  present disordered state of the opinions of Edgar, the only way to a lasting  accommodation was to alarm his security, by asserting her own independence.  Her difficulty, however, was still considerable as to the means. The severe  punishment she had received, and the self blame and penitence she had incurred,  from her experiment with Sir Sedley Clarendel, all rendered, too, abortive, by  Edgar's contempt of the object, determined her to suffer no hopes, no feelings  of her own, to engross her ever more from weighing those of another. The end,  therefore, of her deliberation was to shew general gaiety, without appropriate  favour, and to renew solicitude on his part by a displayed ease of mind on her  own.  Elated with this idea, she determined upon every possible public exhibition by  which she could execute it to the best advantage. Mrs. Berlinton had but to  appear, to secure the most fashionable persons at Southampton for her parties,  and soon renewed the same course of life she had lived at Tunbridge, of seeing  company either at home or abroad every day, except when some accidental plan  offered a scheme of more novelty.  Upon all these occasions, young Westwyn, though wholly unsought, and even  unthought of by Camilla, was instinctively and incautiously the most alert to  second her plan; he was her first partner when she danced, her constant  attendant when she walked, and always in wait to converse with her when she was  seated; while, not purposing to engage him, she perceived not his fast growing  regard, and intending to be open to all alike, observed not the thwarting  effect to her design of this peculiar assiduity.  By old Mr. Westwyn this intercourse was yet more urgently forwarded. Bewitched  with Camilla, he carried his son to her wherever she appeared, and said aloud  to everybody but herself: 'If the boy and girl like one another, they shall  have one another; and I won't inquire what she's worth; for she thinks so well  of my son, that I'd rather he'd have her than an empress. Money goes but a  little way to make people happy; and true love's not a thing to be got every  day; so if she has a mind to my Hal, and Hal has a mind to her, why, if they  have not enough, he must work hard and get more. I don't like to cross young  people. Better let a man labour with his hands, than fret away his spirit.  Neither a boy nor a girl are good for much when they've got their hearts broke.'  This new experiment of Camilla, like every other deduced from false reasoning,  and formed upon false principles, was flattering in its promise, pernicious in  its progress, and abortive in its performance. Edgar saw with agony what he  conceived the ascendance of a new attachment built upon the declension of all  regard for himself; and in the first horror of his apprehensions, would have  resisted the supplanter by enforcing his own final claim; but Dr. Marchmont  represented that, since he had heard in silence his right to that claim  solemnly withdrawn, he had better first ascertain if this apparent connection  with young Westwyn were the motive, or only the consequence of that resumption:  'If the first be the case,' he added, 'you must trust her no more; a heart so  inflammable as to be kindled into passion by a mere accidental blaze of  gallantry and valour, can have nothing in consonance with the chaste purity and  fidelity your character requires and merits: If the last, investigate whether  the net in which she is entangling herself is that of levity, delighting in  change, or of pique, disguising its own agitation in efforts to agitate others.'  'Alas!' cried the melancholy Edgar, 'in either case, she is no more the artless  Camilla I first adored! that fatal connection at the Grove, formed while her  character, pure, white, and spotless, was in its enchanting, but dangerous  state of first ductility, has already broken into that clear transparent  singleness of mind, so beautiful in its total ignorance of every species of  scheme, every sort of double measure, every idea of secret view and latent  expedient!'  'Repine not, however, at the connection till you know whether she owe to it her  defects, or only their manifestation. A man should see the woman he would marry  in many situations, ere he can judge what chance he may have of happiness with  her in any. Though now and then 'tis a blessed, 'tis always a perilous state;  but the man who has to weather its storms, should not be remiss in studying the  clouds which precede them.'  'Ah, Doctor! by this delay ... by these experiments ... should I lose her!...'  'If by finding her unworthy, where is the loss?'  Edgar sighed, but acknowledged this question to be unanswerable.  'Think, my dear young friend, what would be your sufferings to discover any  radical, inherent failing, when irremediably hers! run not into the very common  error of depending upon the gratitude of your wife after marriage, for the  inequality of her fortune before your union. She who has no fortune at all,  owes you no more for your alliance, than she who has thousands; for you do not  marry her because she has no fortune! you marry her because you think she has  some endowment, mental or personal, which you conclude will conduce to your  happiness; and she, on her part, accepts you, because she supposes you or your  situation will contribute to hers. The object may be different, but neither  side is indebted to the other, since each has self, only, in contemplation; and  thus, in fact, rich or poor, high or low, whatever be the previous distinction  between the parties, on the hour of marriage they begin as equals. The  obligation and the debt of gratitude can only commence when the knot is tied:  self, then, may give way to sympathy; and whichever, from that moment, most  considers the other, becomes immediately the creditor in the great account of  life and happiness.'  While Camilla, in gay ignorance of danger, and awake only to hope, pursued her  new course, Eugenia had the infinite delight of improving daily and even hourly  in the good graces of Mrs. Berlinton; who soon discovered how wide from justice  to that excellent young creature was all judgment that could be formed from her  appearance. She found that she was as elegant in her taste for letters as  herself, and far more deeply cultivated in their knowledge; that her manners  were gentle, her sentiments were elevated, yet that her mind was humble; the  same authors delighted and the same passages struck them; they met every  morning; they thought every morning too short, and their friendship, in a very  few days, knit by so many bands of sympathy, was as fully established as that  which already Mrs. Berlinton had formed with Camilla.  To Eugenia this treaty of amity was a delicious poison, which, while it  enchanted her faculties by day, preyed upon her vitals by night. She frequently  saw Melmond, and though a melancholy bow was almost all the notice she ever  obtained from him, the countenance with which he made it, his air, his figure,  his face, nay his very dress, for the half instant he bestowed upon her,  occupied all her thoughts till she saw him again, and had another to con over  and dwell upon.  Melmond, inexpressibly wretched at the deprivation of all hope of Indiana, at  the very period when fortune seemed to favour his again pursuing her, dreamt  not of this partiality. His time was devoted to deliberating upon some  lucrative scheme of future life, which his literary turn of mind rendered  difficult of selection, and which his refined love of study and retirement made  hateful to him to undertake.  He was kind, however, and even consoling to his aunt, who saw his nearly  desolate state with a compunction bitterly increased by finding she had thrown  their joint properties, with her own person, into the hands of a rapacious  tyrant. To soften her repentance, and allow her the soothing of all she could  spare of her own time, Mrs. Berlinton invited her to her own house. Mr. Ulst,  of course included in the invitation, made the removal with alacrity, not for  the pleasure it procured his wife, but for the money it saved himself; and Mrs.  Mittin voluntarily resigned to them the apartment she had chosen for her own,  by way of a little peace-offering for her undesired length of stay; for still,  though incessantly Camilla inquired for her account, she had received no answer  from the creditors, and was obliged to wait for another and another post.  Mrs. Ulst, though not well enough, at present, to see company, and at all  times, fanatically averse to every species of recreation, could not entirely  avoid Eugenia, whose visits were constant every morning, and whose expected  inheritance made a similar wish occur for her nephew, with that which had  disposed of her niece; for she flattered herself that if once she could see  them both in possession of great wealth, her mind would be more at ease.  She communicated this idea to Mr. Ulst, who, most willing, also, to get rid of  the reproach of the poverty and ruin of Melmond, imparted it, with strong  exhortation for its promotion, to the young man; but he heard with disdain the  mercenary project, and protested he would daily labour for his bread, in  preference to prostituting his probity, by soliciting a regard he could never  return, for the acquirement of a fortune which he never could merit.  Mr. Ulst, much too hard to feel this as any reflection upon himself, applied  for the interest of Mrs. Berlinton; but she so completely thought with her  brother, that she would not interfere, till Mr. Ulst made some observations  upon Eugenia herself, that inclined her to waver.  He soon remarked, in that young and artless character, the symptoms of the  partiality she had conceived in favour of Melmond, which, when once pointed  out, could not be mistaken by Mrs. Berlinton, who, though more than equally  susceptible with Eugenia, was self-occupied, and saw neither her emotion at his  name, nor her timid air at his approach, till Mr. Ulst, whose discernment had  been quickened by his wishes, told her when, and for what, to look.  Touched now, herself, by the double happiness that might ensue, from a  gratified choice to Eugenia, and a noble fortune to her brother, she took up  the cause, with delicacy, yet with pity; representing all the charming mental  and intellectual accomplishments of Eugenia, and beseeching him not to  sacrifice both his interest and his peace, in submitting to a hopeless passion  for one object, while he inflicted all its horrors upon another.  Melmond, amazed and softened, listened and sighed; but protested such a change,  from all of beauty to all of deformity, was impracticable; and that though he  revered the character she painted, and was sensible to the honour of such a  preference, he must be base, double, and perjured, to take advantage of her  great, yet unaccountable goodness, by heartless professions of feigned  participation.  Mrs. Berlinton, to whom sentiment was irresistible, urged the matter no longer,  but wept over her brother, with compassionate admiration.  Another day only passed, when Mrs. Mittin picked up a paper upon the stairs,  which she saw fall from the pocket of Eugenia, in drawing out her handkerchief,  but which, determining to read ere she returned, she found contained these  lines.  'O Reason! friend of the troubled breast, guide of the wayward fancy, moderator  of the flights of hope, and sinkings of despair, Eugenia calls thee!'  O! to a feeble, suppliant Maid, Light of Reason, lend thy aid! And with thy mild, thy lucid ray, Point her the way To genial calm and mental joy! From Passion far! whose flashes bright Startle—affright— Yet ah! invite! With varying powers attract, repel, Now fiercely beam, Now softly gleam, With magic spell Charm to consume, win to destroy! Ah! lead her from the chequer'd glare So false, so fair!— Ah, quick from Passion bid her fly, Its sway repulse, its wiles defy; And to a feeble, suppliant heart Thy aid, O Reason's light, impart! Next, Eugenia, point thy prayer That He whom all thy wishes bless, Whom all thy tenderest thoughts confess, Thy calm may prove, thy peace may share. O, if the griefs to him assign'd, To thee might pass—thy strengthened mind Would meet all woe, support all pain, Suffering despise, complaint disdain, Brac'd with new nerves each ill would brave, From Melmond but one pang to save!' Overjoyed by the possession of the important secret this little juvenile  effusion of tenderness betrayed, Mrs. Mittin ran with it to Mrs. Berlinton, and  without mentioning she had seen whence the paper came, said she had found it  upon the stairs: for even those who have too little delicacy to attribute to  treachery a clandestine indulgence of curiosity, have a certain instinctive  sense of its unfairness, which they evince without avowing, by the care with  which they soften their motives, or their manner, of according themselves this  species of gratification.  Mrs. Berlinton, who scrupulously would have withheld from looking into a  letter, could not see a copy of verses, and recognise the hand of Eugenia,  already known to her by frequent notes, and refrain reading. That she should  find any thing personal, did not occur to her; to peruse, therefore, a  manuscript ode or sonnet, which the humility of Eugenia might never voluntarily  reveal, caused her no hesitation; and she ran through the lines with the  warmest delight, till, coming suddenly upon the end, she burst into tears, and  flew to the apartment of her brother.  She put the paper into his hand without a word. He read it hastily. Surprised,  confounded, disordered, he looked at his sister for some explanation or  comment; she was still silently in tears; he read it again, and with yet  greater emotion; when, holding it back to her, 'Why, my sister,' he cried, 'why  would she give you this? why would you deliver it? Ah! leave me, in pity, firm  in integrity, though fallen in fortune!'  'My brother, my dear brother, this matchless creature merits not so degrading  an idea; she gave me not the precious paper ... she knows not I possess it; it  was found upon the stairs: Ah! far from thus openly confessing her unhappy  prepossession, she conceals it from every human being; even her beloved sister,  I am convinced, is untrusted; upon paper only she has breathed it, and breathed  it as you see ... with a generosity of soul that is equal to the delicacy of  her conduct.'  Melmond now felt subdued. To have excited such a regard in a mind that seemed  so highly cultivated, and so naturally elegant, could not fail to touch him;  and the concluding line deeply penetrated him with tender though melancholy  gratitude. He took the hand of his sister, returned her the paper, and was  going to say: 'Do whatever you think proper;' but the idea of losing all right  to adore Indiana checked and silenced him; and mournfully telling her he  required a little time for reflection, he entreated to be left to himself.  He was not suffered to ruminate in quiet; Mrs. Mittin, proud of having any  thing to communicate to a relation of Mrs. Berlinton's, made an opportunity to  sit with Mrs. Ulst, purposely to communicate to her the discovery that Miss  Eugenia Tyrold was in love with, and wrote verses upon, her nephew. Melmond was  instantly sent for; the important secret was enlarged upon with remonstrances  so pathetic, not to throw away such an invitation to the most brilliant good  fortune, in order to cast himself, with his vainly nourished passion, upon  immediate hardships, or lasting penury; that reason as well as interest,  compelled him to listen; and, after a severe conflict, he gave his reluctant  promise to see Eugenia upon her next visit, and endeavour to bias his mind to  the connexion that seemed likely to ensue.  Camilla, who was in total ignorance of the whole of this business, received,  during the dinner, an incoherent note from her sister, conjuring that she would  search immediately, but privately, in her own chamber, in the dressing-room of  Mrs. Berlinton, in the hall, and upon the stairs, for a paper in her  hand-writing, which she had somewhere lost, but which she besought her, by all  that she held dear, not to read when she found; protesting she should shut  herself up for ever from the whole world, if a syllable of what she had written  on that paper were read by a human being.  Camilla could not endure to keep her sister a moment in this suspensive state,  and made an excuse for quitting the table that she might instantly seek the  manuscript. Melmond and Mrs. Berlinton both conjectured the contents of the  billet, and felt much for the modest and timid Eugenia; but Mrs. Mittin could  not confine herself to silent suggestion; she rose also, and running after  Camilla, said: 'My dear Miss, has your sister sent to you to look for any  thing?'  Camilla asked the meaning of her inquiry; and she then owned she had picked up,  from the stairs, a sort of love letter, in which Miss Eugenia had wrote  couplets upon Mr. Melmond.  Inexpressibly astonished, Camilla demanded their restoration; this soon  produced a complete explanation, and while, with equal surprise and concern,  she learnt the secret of Eugenia, and its discovery to its object, she could  not but respect and honour all she gathered from Mrs. Berlinton of the  behaviour of her brother upon the detection; and his equal freedom from  presumptuous vanity, or mercenary projects, induced her to believe her sister's  choice, though wholly new to her, was well founded; and that if he could  conquer his early propensity for Indiana, he seemed, of all the characters she  knew, Edgar alone and always excepted, the most peculiarly formed for the  happiness of Eugenia.  She begged to have the paper, and entreated her sister might never know into  whose hands it had fallen. This was cheerfully agreed to; but Mrs. Mittin,  during the conference, had already flown to Eugenia, and amidst a torrent of  offers of service, and professions of power to do any thing she pleased for  her, suffered her to see that her attachment was betrayed to the whole house.  The agony of Eugenia was excessive; and she resolved to keep her chamber till  she returned to Cleves, that she might neither see nor be seen any more by  Melmond nor his family. Scarce could she bear to be broken in upon even by  Camilla, who tenderly hastened to console her. She hid her blushing conscious  face, and protested she would inhabit only her own apartment for the rest of  her life.  The active Mrs. Mittin failed not to carry back the history of this resolution;  and Melmond, to his unspeakable regret in being thus precipitated, thought  himself called upon in all decency and propriety to an immediate declaration.  He could not, however, assume fortitude to make it in person; nor yet was his  mind sufficiently composed for writing; he commissioned, therefore, his sister  to be the bearer of his overtures.  He charged her to make no mention of the verses, which it was fitting should,  on his part, pass unnoticed, though she could not but be sensible his present  address was their consequence; he desired her simply to state his high  reverence for her virtues and talents, and his consciousness of the inadequacy  of his pretensions to any claim upon them, except what arose from the grateful  integrity of esteem with which her happiness should become the first object of  his future life, if she forbade not his application for the consent of Sir Hugh  and Mr. Tyrold to solicit her favour.  With respect to Indiana, he begged her, unless questioned, to be wholly silent.  To say his flame for that adorable creature was extinguished would be utterly  false; but his peace, as much as his honour, would lead him to combat,  henceforth, by all the means in his power, his ill-fated and woe-teeming  passion.  This commission was in perfect consonance with the feelings of Mrs. Berlinton,  who, though with difficulty she gained admission, executed it with the most  tender delicacy to the terrified Eugenia, who, amazed and trembling, pale and  incredulous, so little understood what she heard, so little was able to believe  what she wished, that, when Mrs. Berlinton, with an affectionate embrace,  begged her answer, she asked if it was not Indiana of whom she was speaking!  Mrs. Berlinton then thought it right to be explicit: she acknowledged the early  passion of her brother for that young lady, but stated that, long before he had  ventured to think of herself, he had determined its conquest; and that what  originally was the prudence of compulsion, was now, from his altered prospects  in life, become choice: 'And believe me,' added she, 'from my long and complete  knowledge of the honour and the delicacy of his opinion, as well as of the  tenderness and gratitude of his nature, the woman who shall once receive his  vows, will find his life devoted to the study of her happiness.'  Eugenia flew into her arms, hung upon her bosom, wept, blushed, smiled, and  sighed, alternately; one moment wished Indiana in possession of her fortune,  the next thought she herself, in all but beauty, more formed for his felicity,  and ultimately gave her tacit but transported consent to the application.  Melmond, upon receiving it, heaved what he fondly hoped would be his last sigh  for Indiana; and ordering his horse, set off immediately for Cleves and  Etherington; determined frankly to state his small income and crushed  expectations; and feeling almost equally indifferent to acceptance or rejection.  Camilla devoted the afternoon to her agitated but enraptured sister, who  desired her secret might spread no further, till the will of her father and  uncle should decide its fate; but the loquacious Mrs. Mittin, having some cheap  ribands and fine edgings to recommend to Miss Margland and Indiana, could by no  means refrain from informing them, at the same time, of the discovered  manuscript.  'Poor thing!' cried Indiana, 'I really pity her. I don't think,' imperceptibly  gliding towards the glass; 'I don't think, by what I have seen of Mr. Melmond,  she has much chance; I've a notion he's rather more difficult.'  'Really this is what I always expected!' said Miss Margland; 'It's just exactly  what one might look for from one of your learned educations, which I always  despised with all my heart. Writing love verses at fifteen! Dr. Orkborne's made  a fine hand of her! I always hated him, from the very first. However, I've had  nothing to do with the bringing her up, that's my consolation! I thank Heaven I  never made a verse in my life! and I never intend it.'
