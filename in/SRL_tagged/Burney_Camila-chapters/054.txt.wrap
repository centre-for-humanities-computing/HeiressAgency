 The Pantiles  A servant tapt early at the door of Camilla, the next morning, to acquaint her  that a lady, who called herself the person that had been so much obliged to her  the preceding day, begged the honour of being admitted.  Camilla was sorry, after the suspicions of Mrs. Arlbery, that she did not send  up her name; yet, already partially disposed, her prepossession was not likely  to be destroyed by the figure that now appeared.  A beautiful young creature, with an air of the most attractive softness, eyes  of the most expressive loveliness, and a manner which by every look and every  motion announced a soul 'tremblingly alive,' glided gently into the room, and  advancing, with a graceful confidence of kindness, took both her hands, and  pressing them to her heart, said, 'What happiness so soon to have found you! to  be able to pour forth all the gratitude I owe you, and the esteem with which I  am already inspired!'  Camilla was struck with admiration and pleasure; and gave way to the most  lively delight at the fortunate accident which occasioned her walking out in a  place entirely unknown to her; declaring she should ever look back to that  event as to one of the marked blessings of her life.  'If you,' answered the fair stranger, 'have the benevolence thus to value our  meeting, how should it be appreciated by one who is so eternally indebted to  it? I had not perceived the approach of that person. He broke in upon me when  least a creature so ungenial was present to my thoughts. I was reading a letter  from the most amiable of friends, the most refined—perhaps—of human beings!'  Camilla, impatient for some explanation, answered, 'I hope, at least, that  friend will be spared hearing of your alarm?'  'I hope so! for his own griefs already overwhelm him. Never may it be my sad  lot to wound where I mean only to console.'  At the words his own, Camilla felt herself blush. She had imagined it was some  female friend. She now found her mistake, and knew not what to imagine next.  'I had retired,' she continued, 'from the glare of company, and the weight of  uninteresting conversation, to read, at leisure and in solitude, this dear  letter—heart-breaking from its own woes, heart-soothing to mine! In a place  such as this, seclusion is difficult. I drove some miles off, and ordered my  carriage to wait in the high road, while I strolled alone upon the common. I  delight in a solitary ramble by moonlight. I can then indulge in uninterrupted  rumination, and solace my melancholy by pronouncing aloud such sentences, and  such names, as in the world I cannot utter. How exquisitely sweet do they sound  to ears unaccustomed to such vibrations!'  Camilla was all astonishment and perplexity. A male friend so beloved, who  seemed to be neither father, brother, nor husband; a carriage at her command,  though without naming one relation to whom either that or herself might belong;  and sentiments so tender she was almost ashamed to listen to them; all  conspired to excite a wonder that painfully prayed for relief: and in the hope  to obtain it, with some hesitation, she said, 'I should have sought you myself  this morning, for the pleasure of inquiring after your safety, but that I was  ignorant by what name to make my search.'  The fair unknown looked down for a moment, with an air that shewed a perfect  consciousness of the inquiry meant by this speech; but turning aside the  embarrassment it seemed to cause her, she presently raised her head, and said,  'I had no difficulty to find you, for my servant, happily, made his inquiry at  once at this hotel.'  Disappointed and surprised by this evasion, Camilla saw now an evident mystery,  but knew not how to press forward any investigation. She began, therefore, to  speak of other things, and her fair guest, who had every mark of an education  rather sedulously than naturally cultivated, joined readily in a conversation  less personal.  They did not speak of Tunbridge, of public places, nor diversions; their  themes, all chosen by the stranger, were friendship, confidence, and  sensibility, which she illustrated and enlivened by quotations from favourite  poets, aptly introduced and feelingly recited; yet always uttered with a sigh,  and an air of tender melancholy. Camilla was now in a state so depressed, that,  notwithstanding her native vivacity, she fell as imperceptibly into the  plaintive style of her new acquaintance, who seemed habitually pensive, as if  sympathy rather than accident had brought them together.  Yet when chance led to some mention of the adventure of the preceding evening,  and the lady made again an animated eulogium of the friend whose letter she was  perusing; she hazarded, with an half smile, saying: 'I hope—for his own sake,  this friend is some sage and aged personage?'  'O no!' she answered; 'he is in the bloom of youth.'  Camilla, again a little disconcerted, paused; and the lady went on.  'It was in Wales I first met him; upon a spot so beautiful that painting can  never do it justice. I have made, however, a little sketch of it, which, some  day or other, I will shew you, if you will have the goodness to let me see more  of you.'  Camilla could not refrain from an eager affirmative; and the conversation was  then interrupted by a message from Mrs. Arlbery, who always breakfasted in her  own room, to announce that she was going out lodging-hunting.  Camilla would rather have remained with her new acquaintance, better adapted to  her present turn of mind than Mrs. Arlbery; but this was impossible, and the  lovely stranger hastened away, saying she would call herself the next morning  to shew the way to her house, where she hoped they might pass together many  soothing and consolatory hours.  Camilla found Mrs. Arlbery by no means in her usual high spirits. The opening  of her Tunbridge campaign had so far from answered its trouble and expence,  that she heartily repented having quitted the Grove. The Officers either were  not arrived in the neighbourhood, or were wholly engaged in military business;  Camilla, instead of contributing to the life of the excursion, seemed to hang  heavily both upon that, and upon herself; and Sir Sedley Clarendel, whose own  proposition had brought it to bear, had not yet made his appearance, though  lodging in the same hotel.  Thus vexatiously disappointed, she was ill-disposed to listen with pleasure to  the history Camilla thought it indispensable to relate of her recent visit: and  in answer to all praise of this fair Incognita, only replied by asking her name  and connexions. Camilla felt extremely foolish in confessing she had not yet  learnt them. Mrs. Arlbery then laughed unmercifully at her commendations, but  concluded with saying: 'Follow, however, your own humour; I hate to torment or  be tormented: only take care not to be seen with her.'  Camilla rejoiced she did not exact any further restriction, and hoped all  raillery would soon be set aside, by an honourable explanation.  They now repaired to the Pantiles, where the gay company and gay shops afforded  some amusement to Camilla, and to Miss Dennel a wonder and delight, that kept  her mouth open, and her head jerking from object to object, so incessantly,  that she saw nothing distinctly, from the eagerness of her fear lest anything  should escape her.  Mrs. Arlbery, meeting with an old acquaintance in the bookseller's shop, there  sat down with him, while the two young ladies loitered at the window of a  toy-shop, struck with just admiration of the beauty and ingenuity of the  Tunbridge ware it presented to their view; till Camilla, in a party of young  men who were strolling down the Pantiles, and who went into the bookseller's  shop, distinguished the offender of the fair unknown.  To avoid following, or being recollected by a person so odious to her, she  entered the toy-shop with Miss Dennel, where she amused herself, till Mrs.  Arlbery came in search of her, in selecting such various little articles for  purchase as she imagined would amount to about half a crown; but which were put  up for her at a guinea. This a little disconcerted her: though, as she was  still unusually rich, from Mr. Tyrold's having advanced her next quarterly  allowance, she consoled herself that they would serve for little keep-sakes for  her sisters and her cousin: yet she determined, when next she entered a shop  for convenience, to put nothing apart as a buyer, till she had inquired its  price.  The assaulter, Lord Newford, a young nobleman of the ton, after taking a  staring survey of every thing and every body around, and seeing no one of more  consequence, followed Mrs. Arlbery, with whom formerly he had been slightly  acquainted, to the toy-shop. He asked her how she did, without touching his  hat; and how long she had been at Tunbridge, without waiting for an answer; and  said he was happy to have the pleasure of seeing her, without once looking at  her.  To his first sentence, Mrs. Arlbery made a civil answer; but, repenting it upon  the two sentences that succeeded, she heard them without seeming to listen, and  fixing her eyes upon him, when he had done, coolly said, 'Pray have you seen  any thing of my servant?'  Lord Newford, somewhat surprised, replied, 'No.'  'Do look for him, then,' cried she, negligently, 'there's a good man.'  Lord Newford, a little piqued, and a little confused at feeling so, said he  should be proud to obey her; and turning short off to his companion, cried,  'Come, Offy, why dost loiter? where shall we ride this morning?' And, taking  him by the arm, quitted the Pantiles.  Mrs. Arlbery, laughing heartily, now felt her spirits a little revive; 'I  doat,' she cried, 'upon meeting, now and then, with insolence, for I have a  little taste for it myself, which I make some conscience of not indulging  unprovoked.'  They then proceeded to the milliner's, to equip themselves for going to the  rooms at night. Mrs. Arlbery and Miss Dennel, who were both rich, gave large  orders: Camilla, indifferent to every thing except to avoid appearing in a  manner that might disgrace her party, told the milliner to choose for her what  she thought fashionable that was most reasonable. She was soon fitted up with  what was too pretty to disapprove, and desiring immediately to pay her bill,  found it amounted to five guineas; though she had imagined she should have  change out of two.  She had only six, and some silver; but was ashamed to dispute, or desire any  alteration; she paid the money; and only determined to apply to another person  than the seller, when next she wanted any thing reasonable.  Mrs. Arlbery now ordered the carriage, and they drove to Mount Pleasant, where  she hired a house for the season, to which they were to remove the next day.  In the evening, they went to the Rooms, where the decidedly fashionable mien  and manner of Mrs. Arlbery, attracted more general notice and admiration than  the youthful captivation of Camilla, or the pretty face and expensive attire of  Miss Dennel.  Dressed by the milliner of the day, Camilla could not fail to pass uncensured,  at least, with respect to her appearance; but her eyes wanted their usual  lustre, from the sadness of her heart, and she never looked less herself, nor  to less advantage.  The master of the ceremonies brought to her Sir Theophilus Jarard; but as she  had seen him the companion of Lord Newford, to whom she had conceived a strong  aversion, she declined dancing. He looked surprised, but rather offended than  disappointed, and with a little laugh, half contemptuous, as if ashamed of  having offered himself, stalked away.  Sir Sedley Clarendel was now sauntering into the room. Mrs. Arlbery, willing to  shew her young friend in a favourable point of view to him, though more from  pique at his distance, than from any thought at that moment of Camilla, told  her she must positively accept Sir Theophilus, whose asking her must be  regarded as a particular distinction, for he was notoriously a man of the ton.  And, heedless of her objections, told Mr. Dennel to call him back.  'How can I do that,' said Mr. Dennel, 'after seeing her refuse him with my own  eyes?'  'O, nobody cares about a man's eyes,' said Mrs. Arlbery; 'go and tell him Miss  Tyrold has changed her mind, and chooses to dance.'  'As to her changing her mind,' he answered, 'that's likely enough; but I don't  see how it's any reason I should go of a fool's errand.'  'Pho, pho, go directly; or you sha'n't dine before eight o'clock for the whole  Tunbridge season.'  'Nay,' said Mr. Dennel, who had an horror of late hours, 'if you will promise  we shall dine more in reason'—  'Yes, yes,' cried Mrs. Arlbery, hurrying him off, notwithstanding the  reiterated remonstrances of Camilla.  'See, my dear,' she then added, laughing, 'how many weapons you must have in  use, if you would govern that strange animal called man! yet never despair of  victory; for, depend upon it, there is not one of the race that, with a little  address, you may not bring to your feet.'  Camilla, who had no wish but for one single votary, and whose heart was sunk  from her failure in obtaining that one, listened with so little interest or  spirit, that Mrs. Arlbery, quite provoked, resolved not to throw away another  idea upon her for the rest of the evening. And therefore, as her niece went  completely and constantly for nothing with her, she spoke no more, till, to her  great relief, she was joined by General Kinsale.  Mr. Dennel returned with an air not more pleased with his embassy, than her own  appeared with her auditress. The gentleman, he said, had joined two others, and  they were all laughing so violently together, that he could not find an  opportunity to deliver his message, for they seemed as if they would only make  a joke of it.  Mrs. Arlbery then saw that he had got between Lord Newford and Sir Sedley, and  that they were all three amusing themselves, without ceremony or disguise, at  the expense of every creature in the room; up and down which they strolled, arm  in arm, looking familiarly at every body, but speaking to nobody; whispering  one another in hoarse low voices, and then laughing immoderately loud: while  nothing was distinctly heard, but from time to time, 'What in the world is  become of Mrs. Berlinton to-night?' or else, 'How stupid the Rooms are without  Lady Alithea.'  Mrs. Arlbery, who, like the rest of the world, saw her own defects in as  glaring colours, and criticised them with as much animated ridicule as those of  her neighbours, when exhibited by others, no sooner found she was neglected by  this set, than she raved against the prevailing ill manners of the leaders in  the ton, with as much asperity of censure, as if never for a moment betrayed  herself, by fashion, by caprice, nor by vanity, to similar foibles. 'Yet, after  all,' cried she presently, 'to see fools behave like fools, I am well content.  I have no anger, therefore, against Lord Newford, nor Sir Theophilus Jarard; if  they were not noticed for being impertinent, how could they expect to be  noticed at all? When there is but one line that can bring them forward, I  rather respect them that they have found it out. But what shall we say to Sir  Sedley Clarendel? A man as much their superior in capacity as in powers of  pleasing? 'Tis a miserable thing, my dear General, to see the dearth of  character there is in the world. Pope has bewailed it in women; believe me, he  might have extended his lamentation. You may see, indeed, one man grave, and  another gay; but with no more "mark or likelihood," no more distinction of  colouring, than what simply belongs to a dismal face or a merry one: and with  just as little light and shade, just as abrupt a skip from one to the other, as  separates inevitably the old man from the young one. We are almost all, my good  General, of a nature so pitifully plastic, that we act from circumstances, and  are fashioned by situation.'  Then, laughing at her own pique, 'General,' she added, 'shall I make you a  confession? I am not at all sure, if that wretched Sir Sedley had behaved as he  ought to have done, and been at my feet all the evening, that I should not, at  this very moment, be amused in the same manner that he is himself! yet it would  be very abominable, I own.'  'This is candid, however.'  'O, we all acknowledge our faults, now; 'tis the mode of the day: but the  acknowledgment passes for current payment; and therefore we never amend them.  On the contrary, they take but deeper root, by losing all chance of  concealment. Yet I am vexed to see that odious Sir Sedley shew so silly a  passion for being a man of the ton, as to suffer himself to be led in a string  by those two poor paltry creatures, who are not more troublesome as fops, than  tiresome as fools, merely because they are better known than himself upon the  turf and at the clubs.'  Here, she was joined by Lord O'Lerney and the honourable Mr. Ormsby. And, in  the next saunter of the tonnish triumvirs, Lord Newford, suddenly seeing with  whom she was associated, stopt, and looking at her with an air of surprise,  exclaimed, 'God bless me! Mrs. Arlbery! I hope you are perfectly well?'  'Infinitely indebted to your lordship's solicitude!' she answered, rather  sarcastically. But, without noticing her manner, he desired to be one in her  tea-party, which she was then rising to form.  She accepted the offer, with a glance of consciousness at the General, who, as  he conducted her, said: 'I did not expect so much grace would so immediately  have been accorded.'  'Alas! my dear General, what can one do? These tonnish people, cordially as I  despise them, lead the world; and if one has not a few of them in one's train,  'twere as well turn hermit. However, mark how he will fare with me! But don't  judge from the opening.'  She now made his lordship so many gay compliments, and mingled so much personal  civility with the general entertainment of her discourse, that, as soon as they  rose from tea, he professed his intention of sitting by her, for the rest of  the evening.  She immediately declared herself tired to death of the Rooms, and calling upon  Miss Dennel and Camilla, abruptly made her exit.  The General, again her conductor, asked how she could leave thus a conquest so  newly made.  'I leave,' she answered, 'only to secure it. He will be piqued that I should  go, and that pique will keep me in his head till to-morrow. 'Tis well, my dear  General, to put any thing there! But if I had stayed a moment longer, my  contempt might have broken forth into satire, or my weariness into yawning: and  I should then inevitably have been cut by the ton party for the rest of the  season.'  Miss Dennel, who had been dancing, and was again engaged to dance, remonstrated  against retiring so soon; but Mrs. Arlbery had a regular system never to listen  to her. Camilla, whom nothing had diverted, was content to retreat.  At the door stood Sir Sedley Clarendel, who, as if now first perceiving them,  said to Mrs. Arlbery, 'Ah! my fair friend!—And how long have you been at the  Wells?'  'Intolerable wretch!' cried she, taking him apart, 'is it thus you keep your  conditions? did you draw me into bringing this poor love-sick thing with me,  only to sigh me into the vapours?'  'My dear madam!' exclaimed he, in a tone of expostulation, 'who can think of  the same scheme two days together? Could you possibly form a notion of anything  so patriarchal?'  Before they retired to their chambers at the hotel, Camilla told Mrs. Arlbery  how shocking to her was the sight, much more any acquaintance with Lord  Newford, who was the person that had so much terrified the lady she had met on  their journey. Mrs. Arlbery assured her he should be exiled her society, if,  upon investigation, he was found the aggressor; but while there appeared so  much mystery in the complaint and the conduct of this unknown lady, she should  postpone his banishment.  Camilla was obliged to submit: but scarce rested till she saw again her new  favourite the next morning.
