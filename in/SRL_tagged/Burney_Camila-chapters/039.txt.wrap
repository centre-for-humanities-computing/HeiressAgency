 The Danger of Disguise  Edgar remained behind, almost petrified: he stood in the little building,  looking after them, yet neither descending nor stirring, till one of the  workmen advanced to fetch the ladder. He then hastily quitted the spot, mounted  his horse, and galloped after the carriage; though without any actual design to  follow it, or any formed purpose whither to go.  The sight, however, of the Major, pursuing the same route, made him, with deep  disgust, turn about, and take the shortest road to Beech Park.  He hardly breathed the whole way from indignation; yet his wrath was without  definition, and nearly beyond comprehensibility even to himself, till suddenly  recurring to the lovely smile with which Camilla had accepted the assistance of  Major Cerwood, he involuntarily clasped his hands and called out: 'O happy  Major!'  Awakened by his ejaculation to the true state of his feelings, he started as  from a sword held at his breast. 'Jealousy!' he cried, 'am I reduced to so  humiliating a passion? Am I capable of love without trust? Unhappy enough to  cherish it with hope? No! I will not be such a slave to the delusions of  inclination. I will abandon neither my honour nor my judgment to my wishes. It  is not alone even her heart that can fully satisfy me; its delicacy must be  mine as well as its preference. Jealousy is a passion for which my mind is not  framed, and which I must not find a torment, but an impossibility!'  He now began to fear he had made a choice the most injudicious, and that  coquetry and caprice had only waited opportunity, to take place of candour and  frankness.  Yet, recollecting the disclaiming speeches he had been compelled to make at  Cleves, he thought, if she had heard them, she might be actuated by resentment.  Even then, however, her manner of shewing it was alarming, and fraught with  mischief. He reflected with fresh repugnance upon the gay and dissipated  society with which she was newly mixing, and which, from her extreme openness  and facility, might so easily, yet so fatally, sully the fair artlessness of  her mind.  He then felt tempted to hint to Mr. Tyrold, who, viewing all things, and all  people in the best light, rarely foresaw danger, and never suspected deception,  the expediency of her breaking off this intercourse, till she could pursue it  under the security of her mother's penetrating protection. But it occurred to  him next, it was possible the Major might have pleased her. Ardent as were his  own views, they had never been declared, while those of the Major seemed  proclaimed without reserve. He felt his face tingle at the idea, though it  nearly made his heart cease to beat; and determined to satisfy his conjecture  ere he took any measure for himself.  To speak to her openly, he thought the surest as well as fairest way, and  resolved, with whatever anguish, should he find the Major favoured, to aid her  choice in his fraternal character, and then travel till he should forget her in  every other.  For this purpose, it was necessary to make immediate enquiry into the situation  of the Major, and then, if she would hear him, relate to her the result; well  assured to gather the state of her heart upon this subject, by her manner of  attending to the least word by which it should be introduced.  Camilla, meanwhile, was somewhat comforted by the exertion she had shewn, and  by her hopes it had struck Edgar with respect.  The next morning, Sir Hugh sent for her again, and begged she would pass the  whole day with her sister Eugenia, and use all her pretty ways to amuse her;  for she had returned home, the preceding morning, quite moped with melancholy,  and had continued pining ever since; refusing to leave her room, even for  meals, yet giving no reason for her behaviour. What had come to her he could  not tell; but to see her so, went to his heart; for she had always, he said,  till now, been chearful and even tempered, though thinking over her learning  made her not much of a young person.  Camilla flew up stairs, and found her, with a look of despondence, seated in a  corner of her room, which she had darkened by nearly shutting all the shutters.  She knew but too well the rude shock she had received, and sought to revive her  with every expression of soothing kindness. But she shook her head, and  continued mute, melancholy, and wrapt in meditation.  More than an hour was spent thus, the strict orders of Sir Hugh forbidding them  any intrusion: but when, at length, Camilla ventured to say, 'Is it possible,  my dearest Eugenia, the passing insolence of two or three brutal wretches can  affect you thus deeply?' She awakened from her silent trance, and raising her  head, while something bordering upon resentment began to kindle in her breast,  cried, 'Spare me this question, Camilla, and I will spare you all reproach.'  'What reproach, my dear sister,' cried Camilla, amazed, 'what reproach have I  merited?'  'The reproach,' answered she, solemnly; 'that, from me, all my family merit!  the reproach of representing to me, that thousands resembled me! of assuring me  I had nothing peculiar to myself, though I was so unlike all my family—of  deluding me into utter ignorance of my unhappy defects, and then casting me,  all unconscious and unprepared, into the wide world to hear them!'  She would now have shut herself into her book-closet; but Camilla, forcing her  way, and almost kneeling to be heard, conjured her to drive such cruel ideas  from her mind, and to treat the barbarous insults that she had suffered with  the contempt they deserved.  'Camilla,' said she, firmly; 'I am no longer to be deceived nor trifled with. I  will no more expose to the light a form and face so hideous:—I will retire  from all mankind, and end my destined course in a solitude that no one shall  discover.'  Camilla, terrified, besought her to form no such plan, bewailed the unfortunate  adventure of the preceding day, inveighed against the inhuman women, and  pleaded the love of all her family with the most energetic affection.  'Those women,' said she, calmly, 'are not to blame; they have been untutored,  but not false; and they have only uttered such truths as I ought to have learnt  from my cradle. My own blindness has been infatuated; but it sprung from  inattention and ignorance.—It is now removed!—Leave me, Camilla; give  notice to my Uncle he must find me some retreat. Tell all that has passed to my  father. I will myself write to my mother—and when my mind is more subdued,  and when sincerely and unaffectedly I can forgive you all from my heart, I may  consent to see you again.'  She then positively insisted upon being left.  Camilla, penetrated with her undeserved, yet irremediable distress, still  continued at her door, supplicating for re-admittance in the softest terms; but  without any success till the second dinner bell summoned her down stairs. She  then fervently called upon her sister to speak once more, and tell her what she  must do, and what say?  Eugenia steadily answered: 'You have already my commission: I have no change to  make in it.'  Unable to obtain anything further, she painfully descended: but the voice of  her Uncle no sooner reached her ears from the dining parlour, than, shocked to  convey to him so terrible a message, she again ran up stairs, and casting  herself against her sister's door, called out 'Eugenia, I dare not obey you!  would you kill my poor Uncle? My Uncle, who loves us all so tenderly? Would you  afflict—would you make him unhappy?'  'No, not for the universe!' she answered, opening the door; and then, more  gently, yet not less steadfastly, looking at her, 'I know,' she continued, 'you  are all very good; I know all was meant for the best; I know I must be a  monster not to love you for the very error to which I am a victim.—I forgive  you therefore all! and I blush to have felt angry.—But yet—at the age of  fifteen—at the instant of entering into the world—at the approach of  forming a connection which—O Camilla! what a time, what a period, to  discover—to know—that I cannot even be seen without being derided and  offended!'  Her voice here faltered, and, running to the window curtain, she entwined  herself in its folds, and called out: 'O hide me! hide me! from every human  eye, from every thing that lives and breathes! Pursue me, persecute me no  longer, but suffer me to abide by myself, till my fortitude is better  strengthened to meet my destiny!'  The least impatience from Eugenia was too rare to be opposed; and Camilla, who,  in common with all her family, notwithstanding her extreme youth, respected as  much as she loved her, sought only to appease her by promising compliance. She  gave to her, therefore, an unresisted, though unreturned embrace, and went to  the dining-parlour.  Sir Hugh was much disappointed to see her without her sister; but she evaded  any account of her commission till the meal was over, and then begged to speak  with him alone.  Gently and gradually she disclosed the source of the sadness of Eugenia: but  Sir Hugh heard it with a dismay that almost overwhelmed him. All his contrition  for the evils of which, unhappily, he had been the cause, returned with  severest force, and far from opposing her scheme of retreat, he empowered  Camilla to offer her any residence she chose; and to tell her he would keep out  of her sight, as the cause of all her misfortunes; or give her the immediate  possession and disposal of his whole estate, if that would make her better  amends than to wait till his death.  This message was no sooner delivered to Eugenia, than losing at once every  angry impression, she hastened down stairs, and casting herself at the knees of  her Uncle, begged him to pardon her design, and promised never to leave him  while she lived.  Sir Hugh, most affectionately embracing her, said—'You are too good, my dear,  a great deal too good, to one who has used you so ill, at the very time when  you were too young to help yourself. I have not a word to offer in my own  behalf; except to hope you will forgive me, for the sake of its being all done  out of pure ignorance.'  'Alas, my dearest Uncle! all I owe to your intentions, is the deepest  gratitude; and it is your's from the bottom of my heart. Chance alone was my  enemy; and all I have to regret is, that no one was sincere enough, kind  enough, considerate enough, to instruct me of the extent of my misfortunes, and  prepare me for the attacks to which I am liable.'  'My dear girl,' said he, while tears started into his eyes, 'what you say  nobody can reply to; and I find I have been doing you one wrong after another,  instead of the least good: for all this was by my own order; which it is but  fair to your brothers and sisters, and father and mother, and the servants, to  confess. God knows, I have faults enough of my own upon my head, without taking  another of pretending to have none!'  Eugenia now sought to condole him in her turn, voluntarily promising to mix  with the family as usual, and only desiring to be excused from going abroad, or  seeing any strangers.  'My dear,' said he, 'you shall judge just what you think fit, which is the  least thing I can do for you, after your being so kind as to forgive me; which  I hope to do nothing in future not to deserve more; meaning always to ask my  brother's advice; which might have saved me all my worst actions, if I had done  it sooner: for I've used poor Camilla no better; except not giving her the  small pox, and that bad fall. But don't hate me, my dears, if you can help it,  for it was none of it done for want of love; only not knowing how to shew it in  the proper manner; which I hope you'll excuse for the score of my bad  education.'  'O, my Uncle!' cried Camilla, throwing her arms round his neck, while Eugenia  embraced his knees, 'what language is this for nieces who owe so much to your  goodness, and who, next to their parents, love you more than anything upon  earth!'  'You are both the best little girls in the world, my dears, and I need have  nothing upon my conscience if you two pass it over; which is a great relief to  me; for there's nobody else I've used so bad as you two young girls; which, God  knows, goes to my heart whenever I think of it.—Poor little innocents!—what  had you ever done to provoke me?'  The two sisters, with the most virtuous emulation, vied with each other in  demonstrative affection, till he was tolerably consoled.  The rest of the day was ruffled but for one moment; upon Sir Hugh's answering,  to a proposition of Miss Margland for a party to the next Middleton  races,—that there was no refusing to let Eugenia take that pleasure, after  her behaving so nobly: her face was then again overcast with the deepest gloom;  and she begged not to hear of the races, nor of any other place, public or  private, for going abroad, as she meant during the rest of her life, immoveably  to remain at home.  He looked much concerned, but assured her she should be mistress in every thing.  Camilla left them in the evening, with a promise to return the next day; and  with every anxiety of her own, lost in pity for her innocent and unfortunate  sister.  She was soon, however, called back to herself, when, with what light yet  remained, she saw Edgar ride up to the coach door.  With indefatigable pains he had devoted the day to the search of information  concerning the Major. Of Mrs. Arlbery he had learned, that he was a man of  fashion, but small fortune; and from the Ensign he had gathered, that even that  small fortune was gone, and that the estate in which it was vested, had been  mortgaged for three thousand pounds, to pay certain debts of honour.  Edgar had already been to the Parsonage House, but hearing Camilla was at  Cleves, had made a short visit, and determined to walk his horse upon the road  till he met the carriage of Sir Hugh; believing he could have no better  opportunity of seeing her alone.  Yet when the coach, upon his riding up to the door, stopt, he found himself in  an embarrassment for which he was unprepared. He asked how she did; desired  news of the health of all the family one by one; and then, struck by the  coldness of her answers, suffered the carriage to drive on.  Confounded at so sudden a loss of all presence of mind, he continued, for a  minute or two, just where she left him; and then galloped after the coach, and  again presented himself at its window.  In a voice and manner the most hurried, he apologised for this second  detention. 'But, I believe,' he said, 'some genius of officiousness has to-day  taken possession of me, for I began it upon a Quixote sort of enterprise, and a  spirit of knight-errantry seems willing to accompany me through it to the end.'  He stopt; but she did not speak. Her first sensation at his sight had been  wholly indignant: but when she found he had something to say which he knew not  how to pronounce, her curiosity was awakened, and she looked earnest for an  explanation.  'I know,' he resumed, with considerable hesitation, 'that to give advice and to  give pain is commonly the same thing:—I do not, therefore, mean—I have no  intention—though so lately you allowed me a privilege never to be  forgotten'—  He could not get on; and his embarrassment, and this recollection, soon robbed  Camilla of every angry emotion. She looked down, but her countenance was full  of sensibility, and Edgar, recovering his voice, proceeded—  'My Quixotism, I was going to say, of this morning, though for a person of whom  I know almost nothing, would urge me to every possible effort—were I certain  the result would give pleasure to the person for whom alone—since with regard  to himself,—I—it is merely——'  Involved in expressions he knew not how to clear or to finish, he was again  without breath: and Camilla, raising her eyes, looked at him with astonishment.  Endeavouring then to laugh, 'One would think,' cried he, 'this same Quixotism  had taken possession of my intellects, and rendered them as confused as if,  instead of an agent, I were a principal.'—  Still wholly in the dark as to his aim, yet, satisfied by these last words, it  had no reference to himself, she now lost enough of the acuteness of her  curiosity to dare avow what yet remained; and begged him, without further  preface, to be more explicit.  Stammering, he then said, that the evident admiration with which a certain  gentleman was seen to sigh in her train, had awakened for him an interest,  which had induced some inquiries into the state of his prospects and  expectations. 'These,' he continued, 'turn out to be, though not high, nor by  any means adequate to—to——however they are such as some previous friendly  exertions, with settled future œconomy, might render more propitious: and for  those previous exertions—Mr. Tyrold has a claim which it would be the pride  and happiness of my life to see him honour;—if—if—'  The if almost dropt inarticulated: but he added—'I shall make some further  enquiries before I venture to say any more.'  'For yourself, then, be they made, Sir!' cried she, suddenly seizing the whole  of the meaning—'not for me?—whoever this person may be to whom you  allude—to me he is utterly indifferent.'  A flash of involuntary delight beamed in the eyes of Edgar at these words: he  had almost thanked her, he had almost dropt the reins of his horse to clasp his  hands: but filled only with her own emotions, without watching his, or waiting  for any answer, she coldly bid him good night, and called to the coachman to  drive fast home.  Edgar, however, was left with a sunbeam of the most lively delight. 'He is  wholly indifferent to her,' he cried, 'she is angry at my interference; she has  but acted a part in the apparent preference—and for me, perhaps, acted it!'  Momentary, however, was the pleasure such a thought could afford him;—'O,  Camilla,' he cried, 'if, indeed, I might hope from you any partiality, why act  any part at all?—how plain, how easy, how direct your road to my heart, if  but straightly pursued!'
