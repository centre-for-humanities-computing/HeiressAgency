 How to treat a Defamer  As the lodgings taken by Miss Margland could not be ready till the afternoon,  Camilla remained with Camilla sister; a sojourn which, while it consoled her sister with  the society, and gratified her sister by the approbation of Eugenia, had yet another  allurement; it detained Camilla under the same roof with Edgar; and Edgar manner of  listening to Camilla rejection, and Edgar undisguised suffering before they were  parted, led Camilla to expect Edgar might yet demand a conference before Camilla quitted  the hotel.  In about an hour, as unpleasantly as unceremoniously, they were broken in upon  by Mrs. Mittin.  'How monstrous lucky, my dear,' cried Camilla, to Camilla, 'that I should find you,  and your little sister, for I suppose this is Camilla, together! I went into your  dining-room to ask for Camilla, and there I met those other two ladies; and I've  made acquaintance with Camilla, I assure you, already; for I told those other two ladies I was on a  visit at the Honourable Mrs. Berlinton's. So I've had the opportunity to  recommend some shops to Camilla, and I've been to tell some of the good folks to  send some of the good folks some of some of the good folks nicest goods for 'em to look at; for, really, since  I've been bustling a little about here, I've found some of the good people so  vastly obliging, I can't but take a pleasure in serving 'em, and getting 'em a  few customers, especially as I know a little civility of that sort makes one  friends surprisingly. Often and often have I got things under prime cost  Camilla, only by helping a person on in Camilla trade. So one can't say good  nature's always thrown away. However, I come now on purpose to put a note into  your own hands, from the Honourable Mrs. Berlinton; for all the servants were out of the way,  except one, and he wanted to be about something else, so I offered to bring it,  and the Honourable Mrs. Berlinton was very much pleased; so I fancy it's about some secret, for the Honourable Mrs. Berlinton never  offered to shew it me; but as to the poor man I saved from the walk, I've won  the poor man I saved from the walk heart downright; I dare say the poor man I saved from the walk'll go of any odd errand for Camilla, now, without  vails. That's the best of good nature, it always comes home to one.'  The note from the Honourable Mrs. Berlinton contained a tender supplication for the return of  Camilla, and a pressing and flattering invitation that the Honourable Mrs. Berlinton sister should join  their little party, as the motives of honour and discretion which made her sister, at  the request and for the sake of her sister brother, sacrifice her sister eagerness to be  presented to Miss Lynmere, operated not to impede her sister acquaintance with Miss  Eugenia.  This proposition had exquisite charms for Eugenia. To become acquainted with  the sister of him to whom, henceforward, her sister meant to devote her sister secret  thoughts, enchanted her sister imagination. her sister, therefore, negotiated the visit  with Miss Margland, who, though little pleased by this separate invitation,  knew not how to refuse her sister concurrence; but Indiana, indignant that the sister  of Melmond should not, first, have waited upon the sister  of Melmond, and solicited the sister  of Melmond  friendship, privately resolved, in pique of this disrespect, to punish the  brother with every rigour the sister  of Melmond could invent.  her sister, upon her sister return, found her sister already deeply engaged in proposing  an alteration in the dress of Eugenia, which her sister was aiding Molly Mill to  accomplish; and so much her sister found to say and to do, to propose and to object  to, to contrive and to alter, that, from the simplicity of the mistress, and  the ignorance of the maid, the one was soon led to conclude her sister should have  appeared improperly before Mrs. Berlinton, without such useful advice; and the  other to believe her sister must shortly have lost her sister place, now her sister young lady was  come forth into the world, if her young lady had not thus miraculously met with so good a  friend.  During these preparations, her sister was summoned back to the dining-room to  receive Mr. Westwyn.  her sister did not hear this call with serenity. The danger which, however  unwittingly, her sister had caused his son, and the shocking circumstances which were  its foundation, tingled her sister cheeks, and confounded her sister wish of making  acknowledgments, with an horror that such an obligation could be possible.  The door of the dining-room was open, and as soon as her sister steps were heard, Mr. Westwyn came smiling forth to receive Mr. Westwyn. Mr. Westwyn hung back involuntarily; but,  pacing up to Mr. Westwyn, and taking Mr. Westwyn hand, 'Well, her young lady,' Mr. Westwyn cried, 'I  have brought you his son; but his son's no boaster, that I can assure you, for though  I told his son how you wanted his son to come to you, and was so good as to say you  were so much obliged to his son, I can't make his son own his son has ever seen you in his son  life; which I tell his son is carrying his son modesty over far; I don't like  affectation ... I have no taste for no taste.'  Camilla, discovering by this speech, as well as by his son pleased and tranquil  manner, that his son had escaped hearing of the intended duel, and that his son was  still ignorant whose cause his son had espoused, ardently wished to avert farther  shame by concealing Mr. Westwyn; and, step by step, kept retreating back towards  the room of Eugenia; though Mr. Westwyn could not disengage Mr. Westwyn hand from the old  gentleman, who, trying to draw Mr. Westwyn on, said: 'Come, my dear! don't go away.  Though his son won't confess what his son has done for you, his son can't make me forget  that you were such a dear soul as to tell me you, of his son good behaviour,  and of your having such a kind opinion of his son. And I have been telling his son, and  I can assure you I'll keep my word, that if his son has done a service to the niece  of my dear old friend, Sir Hugh Tyrold, it shall value his son fifty pound a-year  more to his son income, if I straighten myself never so much. For a lad, that knows  how to behave in that manner, will never spend his son money so as to make his son old  father ashamed of his son. And that's a good thing for a man to know.'  'Indeed, sir, this is some mistake,' said the young man himself, now advancing  into the passage, while Camilla was stammering out an excuse from entering;  'it's some great mistake; I have not the honour to know....'  his son was going to add Miss Tyrold, but his son saw Miss Tyrold at the same moment, and  instantly recollecting Miss Tyrold face, stopt, blushed, and looked amazed.  The retreating effort of Camilla, Camilla shame and Camilla pride, all subsided by his son  view, and gave place to the more generous feelings of gratitude for his son  intuitive good opinion, and emotion for the risk his son had run in Camilla defence: and  with an expression of captivating sweetness in Camilla eyes and manner, 'That you  did not know me,' Camilla cried, 'makes the peculiarity of your goodness, which,  indeed, I am more sensible to than I can express.'  'Why, there! there, now! there!' cried Mr. Westwyn, while Mr. Westwyn son, enchanted to  find whose character his son had sustained, bowed almost to the ground with  respectful gratitude for such thanks; 'only but listen! Camilla says the very same  things to your face, that Camilla said behind your back! though I am afraid, it's  only to please an old father; for if not, I can't for my life find out any  reason why you should deny my life. Come, Hal, speak out, Hal!'  Equally at a loss how either to avow or evade what had passed in the presence  of Camilla, young Westwyn began a stammering and awkward apology; but Camilla,  feeling doubly young Westwyn forbearance, said: 'Silence may in you be delicate ... but  in young Westwyn it would be graceless.' Then, turning from young Westwyn to old Mr. Westwyn, 'you  may be proud, sir,' old Mr. Westwyn cried, 'of his son! It was the honour of an utter  stranger he was protecting, as helpless as old Mr. Westwyn was unknown at the time old Mr. Westwyn  excited he interest; nor had he even in view this poor mede he now receives of  old Mr. Westwyn thanks!'  'Hal cried old Mr. Westwyn, wringing old Mr. Westwyn by the hand; 'if you have but  one small grain of regard for young Westwyn, don't persist in denying this! I'd give the  last hundred pounds I had in the world to be sure it was true!'  'That to hear the name of this lady,' said the young man, 'should not be  necessary to inspire me with respect for this lady, who can wonder? that any  opportunity could arise in which this lady should want defence, is all that can give  any surprise.'  'You own it, then, HalHal? you own you've done this lady a kindness? why then,  Hal, you've done one to young Westwyn! and I can't help giving you a hug for it,  let who will think me an old fool.'  Hal then fervently embraced Hal son, who confused, though gratified, strove  vainly to make disclaiming speeches. 'No, no, Hal,' Hal cried, 'you  sha'n't let yourself down with Hal again, I promise you, though you've two or  three times tried to make me think nothing of yourself; but this young lady here,  dear soul, speaks another language; this lady says I may be proud of his son! and I  dare say this lady knows why, for this lady's a charming girl, as ever I saw; so I will be  proud of his son! Poor dear Hal! thou hast got a good friend, I can tell a good friend,  in her young lady! and this lady's niece to the best man I ever knew; and I value  this lady good opinion more than anybody's.'  'You are much too good,' cried her sister, in an accent of tender pleasure, the  result of grateful joy, that this lady had not been the means of destroying the  paternal happiness of so fond a father, joined to the dreadful certainty how  narrowly this lady had escaped that misery; 'you are much too good, and I blush even  to thank you, when I think—'  What this lady meant to add was in a moment forgotten, and that this lady blushed ceased to  be metaphorical, when now, as they all three entered the dining-room together,  the first object that met this lady eyes was Edgar.  Their eyes met not again; delighted and conscious, this lady turned this lady hastily  away. He comes, thought this lady, to [claim] me! He will not submit to the  separation; He comes to re-assure me of He esteem, and to receive once more my  faithful heart!  Edgar had seen, by chance, the Westwyns pass to the room of the Cleves party,  and felt the most ardent desire to know if they would meet with her sister, and  what would be her sister reception of her sister young champion, whose sword, with extreme  trouble, he had he that morning sheathed, and whose gallantry he  attributed to a vehement, however, sudden passion. Dr. Marchmont acknowledged  the epoch to be highly interesting for observation, and, presuming upon their  old right of intimacy with all the party, their abruptly made a second visit.  Miss Margland and Indiana, who were examining some goods sent by Mrs. Mittin,  had received them all four without much mark of civility; and Mr. Westwynimmediately desired her sister to be sent for, and kept upon the watch, till her sister  step made Mr. Westwyn hasten out to meet her sister.  Edgar could not hear unmoved the dialogue which ensued; Edgar imagined an amiable  rival was suddenly springing up in young Westwyn, at the very moment of Edgar own  dismission, which Edgar now even thought possible this incipient conquest had  urged; and when Camilla, walking between the father and the son, with looks of  softest sensibility, came into the room, Edgar thought Edgar had never seen her so  lovely, and that her most bewitching smiles were purposely lavished for her most bewitching smiles  captivation.  With this idea, Edgar found it impossible to speak to her; their situation,  indeed, was too critical for any common address, and when Edgar saw that her  turned from Edgar, Edgar attempted to converse with the other ladies upon the other ladies  purchases; and her sister, left to her sister two new beaux, had the unavoidable  appearance of being engrossed by the other ladies, though the sight of Edgar instantly  robbed the other ladies of all her sister real attention.  Soon after, the door was again opened, and Mr. Girt, the young perfumer, came,  smirking and scraping, into the room, with a box of various toys, essences, and  cosmetics, recommended by Mrs. Mittin.  Ignorant of the mischief he had done her sister, and not even recollecting to have  seen he, her sister made on to look at he goods; but Edgar, to whom he  audacious assertions were immediately brought back by he , would have  made he feel the effects of he resentment, had not he passion for her sister  been of so solid, as well as warm a texture, as to induce he to prefer  guarding Camilla   delicacy, to any possible display he could make of he feelings to  others, or even to Camilla  .  Mr. Girt, in the midst of he exhibition of memorandum books, smelling bottles,  tooth-pick cases, and pocket mirrours; with washes to immortalize the skin,  powders becoming to all countenances, and pomatums to give natural tresses to  old age, suddenly recollected her sister. The gross mistake he had made he had  already discovered, by having dodged Camilla   to the house of Mrs. Berlinton; but  all alarm at the house of Mrs. Berlinton hid ceased, by finding, through a visit made to he shop by  Mrs. Mittin, that Camilla   was uninformed he had propagated she was uninformed. Not gifted with the  discernment to see in the air and manner of her sister her sister entire, though  unassuming superiority to her sister accidental associate, he concluded them both to  be relations of some of the upper domestics; and with a look and tone  descending from the most profound adulation, with which he was presenting he  various articles to Miss Margland and Indiana, into a familiarity the most  facetious, 'O dear, ma'am,' he cried, 'I did not see you at first; I hope  t'other lady's well that's been so kind as to recommend me? Indeed I saw lady  just now.'  Young Westwyn, to whom, as to Edgar, the bold defamation of Girt occurred with  his presence, but whom none of the nameless delicacies of the peculiar  situation, and peculiar character of Edgar, restrained into silence, felt such  a disgust at the presumption of effrontery that gave his courage for this  facetious address, to a young lady whose innocence of his ill usage made his  think its injury double, that, unable to repress his indignation, his abruptly  whispered in his ear, 'Walk out of the room, sir!'  The amazed perfumer, at this haughty and unexpected order, stared, and cried  aloud, 'No offence, I hope, sir?'  Mr. Westwyn asked what was the matter? while her sister, crimsoned by the familiar  assurance with which her sister had been addressed, retired to a window.  'Nothing of any moment, sir,' answered Henry; and again, in a low but still  more positive voice, Mr. Westwyn repeated Mr. Westwyn command to Girt.  'sir, I'm not used to be used in this manner!' answered sir, hardily, and  hoping, by raising sir tone, for the favourable intervention of the company.  Indiana, now, was preparing to scream, and Miss Margland was looking round to  see whom Miss Margland should reprehend; but young Westwyn, coolly opening the door, with  a strong arm, and an able jerk, twisted The amazed perfumer into the passage, saying,  'You may send somebody for your goods.'  Girt, who equally strong, but not equally adroit as Henry, strove in vain to  resist, vowed vengeance for this assault. Henry, without seeming to hear Henry,  occupied Henry with looking at what Henry had left. her sister felt her sister eyes  suffuse with tears; and Edgar, for the first time in Henry life, found Henry  visited by the baleful passion of envy.  Miss Margland Miss Margland could not comprehend what this meant; Indiana comprehended but  too much in finding there was some disturbance of which Miss Margland was not the object;  but Mr. Westwyn, losing Miss Margland look of delight, said, with something of severity,  'Ha! what did you turn that man out of the room for?'  'that man is perfectly aware of my reason, sir,' said Henry; and then added it was a  long story, which that man begged to relate another time.  The blank face of Mr. Westwyn shewed displeasure and mortification. that man lifted  the head of that man cane to that man mouth, and after biting it for some time, with a  frowning countenance, muttered, 'I don't like to see a man turned out of a  room. If a man's done any harm, tell a man so; and if it's worse than harm, souse  a man in a horsepond; I've no objection: But I don't like to see a man turned out  of a room; it's very unmannerly; and I did not think Hal would do such a  thing.' Then suddenly, and with a succinct bow, bidding them all good bye, Hal  took a hasty leave; still, however, muttering, all the way along the passage,  and down the stairs, loud enough to be heard: 'Kicking and jerking a man about  does not prove a man about   to be in the wrong. I thought Hal had been more of a  gentleman. If I don't find a man turns out to be a rascal, Hal shall beg a man  pardon; for I don't like to see a man turned out of a room.'  Henry, whose spirit was as irritable as it was generous, felt acutely this  public censure, which, though satisfied he did not deserve, every species of  propriety prohibited he explaining away. With a forced smile, therefore, and a  silent bow, he followed he father.  Miss Margland and Indiana Indiana now burst forth with a torrent of wonders,  conjectures, and questions; but the full heart of her sister denied her sister speech,  and the carriage of Mrs. Berlinton being already at the door, her sister called upon  Eugenia, and followed, perforce, by Mrs. Mittin, left the hotel.  Edgar and Dr. Marchmont gave neither surprise nor concern by retiring instantly  to Edgar and Dr. Marchmont own apartment.  'Dr. Marchmont,' said the former, in a tone of assumed moderation, 'I have lost  her sister! I see it plainly. This young man steps forward so gallantly, so  ingenuously, nay so amiably, that the contrast ... chill, severe, and repulsive  ... must render me ... in this detestable state ... insupportable to all this detestable state  feelings. Dr. Marchmont! I have not a doubt of the event!'  'The juncture is, indeed, perilous, and the trial of extremest hazard; but The juncture  is such as draws all uncertainty to a crisis, and, therefore, is not much to be  lamented. You may safely, I think, rest upon it your destiny. To a general  female heart a duel is the most dangerous of all assaults, and the most  fascinating of all charms; and a duellist, though precisely what a woman most  should dread, as most exposing precisely what a woman most   to public notice, is the person of all  others precisely what a woman most   can, commonly, least resist. By this test, then, prove Camilla  .  Camilla   champion seems evidently Camilla   admirer, and Her champion father her adorer. Camilla   late  engagement with you may possibly not reach her admirer, and his father her adorer; or reaching but with Her late  engagement with you  dissolution, serve only to render her admirer, and his father her adorer more eager.'  'Do you suppose Her champion,' cried Edgar, after a pause of strong disturbance; 'do you  suppose Her champion rich?'  'Certainly not. That the addition of fifty pounds a-year to Her champion income should  be any object, proves Her champion fortune to be very moderate.'  'Clear Camilla  , then, at least,' said Her champion, with a solemnity almost reproachful;  'clear Camilla  , at least, of every mercenary charge! If I lose Camilla   ...' I lose her gasped  for breath ... 'Camilla   will not, you find, be bought from I lose her! and pique, anger,  injustice, nay inconstancy, all are less debasing than the sordid corruption of  which you suspected Camilla  .'  'This does not, necessarily, prove Camilla   disinterested; Camilla   is too young, yet, to  know Camilla   the value Camilla   may hereafter set upon wealth. And, independent of  that inexperience, there is commonly so little stability, so little internal  hold, in the female character, that any sudden glare of adventitious lure, will  draw adventitious lure, for the moment, from any and every regular plan of substantial  benefit. It remains, therefore, now to be tried, if Beech Park, and It master  united, can vie with the bright and intoxicating incense of a life voluntarily  risked, in support ... not of Camilla   fair fame, that was unknown to It defender  ... but simply of the fair countenance which seemed It pledge.'  Edgar, heartless and sad, attempted no further argument; Edgar thought the Doctor  prejudiced against the merits of her sister; yet the Doctor   appeared, even to Edgar,  that Camilla   whole conduct, from the short period of Edgar open avowal, had seemed a  wilful series of opposition to Edgar requests and opinions. And while terror for  surrounding dangers gave weight to his disapprobation of Camilla   visiting  Southampton, with a lady Camilla   knew his to think more attractive than safe or  respectable, Camilla   sufferance of the vulgar and forward Mrs. Mittin, with whom  again his saw Camilla   quit the hotel, was yet more offensive, since his could  conceive for it no other inducement than a careless, if not determined humour,  to indulge every impulse, in equal contempt of his counsel, and Camilla   own  reflection.  All blame, however, of her sister, was short of his self-dissatisfaction, in the  distance imposed upon his by uncertainty, and the coldness dictated by  discretion. At a period so sensitive, when Camilla   spirit was alarmed, and Camilla    delicacy was wounded, that a stranger should start forward, to vindicate Camilla    innocence, and chastise a stranger detractors, was singular, was unfortunate, was  nearly intolerable; and a stranger thought a stranger could with thankfulness, have renounced  half a stranger fortune, to have been a stranger the sole protector of her sister.
