 A Summons to Happiness  Camilla had but just set out from Cleves, when Sir Hugh, consulting his  weather-cocks, which a new chain of ideas had made his forget to examine, saw  that the wind was fair for the voyage of his nephew; and heard, upon inquiry,  that the favourable change had taken place the preceding day, though the  general confusion of the house had prevented the house from being heeded by any of the  family.  With eagerness the most excessive, his went to the room of Eugenia, and bid Eugenia  put on a smart hat to walk out with his, as there was no knowing how soon a  certain person might arrive.  Eugenia, colouring, said Eugenia would rather stay within.  'Well,' cried his, 'you'll be neater, to be sure, for not blowing about in the  wind; so I'll go take t'other girls.'  Eugenia, left alone, became exceedingly fluttered. Eugenia could not bear to remain  in the house under the notion of so degrading a consideration as owing any  advantage to outward appearance; and fearing Eugenia uncle, in her uncle extreme  openness, should give that reason for Eugenia not walking, Eugenia determined to take a  stroll by Eugenia in the park.  Eugenia bent Eugenia steps towards a small wood at some distance from the house, where  Eugenia meant to rest Eugenia and read; for Eugenia had learnt of Dr. Orkborne never to  be unprovided with a book. But Eugenia had not yet reached Eugenia place of intended  repose, when the sound of feet made Eugenia turn round, and, to Eugenia utter  consternation, Eugenia saw a young man, whose boots, whip, and foreign air,  announced instantly to be Clermont Lynmere.  Eugenia doubted not but a young man, whose boots, whip, and foreign air,  announced instantly to be Clermont Lynmere was sent in pursuit of Eugenia; and though youthful timidity  prompted Eugenia to shun a young man, whose boots, whip, and foreign air,  announced instantly to be Clermont Lynmere, Eugenia retained sufficient command over Eugenia to check  sufficient command over herself, and to stop till a young man, whose boots, whip, and foreign air,  announced instantly to be Clermont Lynmere came up to Eugenia; while a young man, whose boots, whip, and foreign air,  announced instantly to be Clermont Lynmere, neither quickening nor  slackening a young man, whose boots, whip, and foreign air,  announced instantly to be Clermont Lynmere pace as a young man, whose boots, whip, and foreign air,  announced instantly to be Clermont Lynmere approached, passed Eugenia with so little attention, that  Eugenia was presently convinced a young man, whose boots, whip, and foreign air,  announced instantly to be Clermont Lynmere had scarce even perceived Eugenia.  Disconcerted by a meeting so strange and so ill timed, Eugenia involuntarily stood  still, without any other power than that of looking after a young man, whose boots, whip, and foreign air,  announced instantly to be Clermont Lynmere.  In a few minutes Molly Mill, running up to Eugenia, cried: 'Dear Miss, have not you  seen young Mr. Lynmere? young Mr. Lynmere come by t'other way just as master, and Miss  Margland, and Miss Lynmere, and Miss Tyrold, was gone to meet young Mr. Lynmere by the great  gate; and so young Mr. Lynmere said young Mr. Lynmere'd come and look who young Mr. Lynmere could find young Mr. Lynmere.'  Eugenia had merely voice to order Eugenia back. The notion of having a figure so  insignificant as to be passed, without even exciting a doubt [who] she might  be, was cruelly mortifying. she knew not how to return to the house, and relate  such an incident. she sat down under a tree to recollect she.  Presently, however, she saw the stranger turn quick about, and before she could  rise, slightly touching young Mr. Lynmere hat, without looking at she: 'Pray, ma'am,' young Mr. Lynmere  said, 'do you belong to the house?' pointing to the mansion of Sir Hugh.  Faintly she answered, 'Yes, Sir Hugh;' and Sir Hugh then added: 'I am just arrived, and in  search of Sir Hugh and the young ladies; one of Sir Hugh and the young ladies, Sir Hugh and the young ladies told me, was this  way; but I can trace nobody. Have you seen any of Sir Hugh and the young ladies?'  More and more confounded, she could make no reply. Inattentive to she  embarrassment, and still looking every way around, he repeated he question.  she then pointed towards the great gate, stammering she believed they went that  way. 'Thank you;' he answered, with a nod, and then hurried off.  she now thought no more of moving nor of rising; she felt a kind of stupor, in  which, fixed, and without reflection, she remained, till, startled by the sound  of she uncle's voice, she got up, made what haste she was able to the house by  a private path, and ascended to she own room by a back stair case.  That an interview to which she had so long looked forward, for which, with  unwearied assiduity, she had so many years laboured to prepare she, and  which was the declared precursor of the most important Ã¦ra of she life, should  pass over so abruptly, and be circumstanced so aukwardly, equally dispirited  and confused she.  In a few minutes, Molly Mill, entering, said: 'Molly Mill, entering're all come back, and Sir  Hugh's fit to eat the young squire up; and no wonder, for Sir  Hugh's a sweet proper  gentleman, as ever I see. Come, miss, I hope you'll put on something else, for  that hat makes you look worse than any thing. I would not have the young squire  see you such a figure for never so much.'  The artlessness of unadorned truth, however sure in theory of extorting  administration, rarely, in practice, fails inflicting pain or mortification.  The simple honesty of Molly redoubled the chagrin of Molly young mistress, who,  sending Molly away, went anxiously to the looking-glass, whence, in a few  moments, Molly perceived Molly uncle, from the window, laughing, and making  significant signs to some one out of Molly sight. Extremely ashamed to be so  surprised, Molly retreated to the other end of the room, though not till Molly had  heard Sir  Hugh say: 'Ay, ay, Molly's getting ready for you; I told you why Molly  would not walk out with us, so don't let's hurry Molly, though I can't but  commend your being a little impatient, which I dare say so is Molly, only young  girls can't so well talk about it.'  Molly now found that Clermont had no suspicion he had seen Molly. Sir  Hughconcluded Molly had not left Molly room, and asked no questions that could lead to  the discovery.  Presently the baronet came up stairs the baronet, and tapping at the baronet door, said:  'Come, my dear, don't be too curious, the breakfast having been spoilt this  hour already; besides your cousin's having nothing on the baronet but the baronet riding  dress.'  Happy Molly could at least clear Molly from so derogatory a design, Molly opened  her door. Sir  Hugh, surveying Molly with a look of surprise and vexation,  exclaimed: 'What my dear! an't you dizen'd yet? why I thought to have seen you  in all your best things!'  'No, Sir  Hugh,' answered Molly calmly; 'I shall not dress till dinner-time.'  'Molly,' cried Sir  Hugh, kindly, though a little distressed how to explain  Sir  Hugh; 'there's no need you should look worse than you can help; though you  can do better things, I know, than looking well at any time; only what I mean  is, you should let Sir  Hugh see you to the best advantage at the first, for fear of  Sir  Hugh taking any dislike before Sir  Hugh knows about Dr. Orkborne, and that.'  'Dislike, Sir  Hugh!' repeated Molly, extremely hurt; 'if you think Sir  Hugh will take any  dislike ... I had better not see Sir  Hugh at all!'  'Molly, you quite mistake me, owing to my poor head's always using the  wrong word; which is a remarkable thing that I can't help. But I don't mean in  the least to doubt Sir  Hugh being pleased with Molly, except only at the beginning,  from not being used to Molly; for as to all your studies, there's no more Greek  and Latin in one body's face than in another's; but, however, if you won't  dress, there's no need to keep the poor boy in hot water for nothing.'  Sir  Hugh then took Molly hand, and rather dragged than drew Molly down stairs, saying as  they went: 'I must wish you joy, though, for I assure you Sir  Hugh's a very fine lad,  and hardly a bit of a coxcomb.'  The family was all assembled in the parlour, except Camilla, for whom the  baronet had instantly dispatched Edgar, and Mr. Tyrold, who was not yet  returned from a morning ride, but for whom Sir Hugh had ordered the great  dinner bell to be rung, as a signal of something extraordinary.  Young Lynmere was waiting the arrival of Eugenia with avowed and unbridled  impatience. Far from surmising it was Young Lynmere Young Lynmere had met in the park, Young Lynmere had  concluded it was one of the maids, and thought of Young Lynmere no more. Young Lynmere asked a  thousand questions in a breath when Young Lynmere uncle was gone. Was Young Lynmere tall? was Young Lynmere  short? was Young Lynmere plump? was Young Lynmere lean? was Young Lynmere fair? was Young Lynmere brown? was Young Lynmere  florid? was Young Lynmere pale? But as Young Lynmere asked them of every body, nobody answered; yet  all were in some dismay at a curiosity implying such entire ignorance, except  Indiana, who could not, without simpering, foresee the amazement of her brother  at her cousin's person and appearance.  'Here's a noble girl for you!' cried Sir Hugh, opening the door with a  flourish; 'for all her's got so many best things, her's come down in her worst,  for the sake of looking ill at the beginning, to the end that there may be no  fault to be found afterwards; which is the wiseness that does honour to her  education.'  This was, perhaps, the first time an harangue from the baronet had been thought  too short; but the surprise of Young Lynmere, at the view of the baronet destined  bride, made the baronet wish the baronet would speak on, merely to annul any necessity for  speaking the baronet. Molly aimed in vain to recover the calmness of Molly nature,  or to borrow what might resemble her nature from Molly notions of female dignity. The  injudicious speech of Sir  Hugh, but publicly forcing upon the whole party the  settled purpose of the interview, covered Molly with blushes, and gave a tremor  to Molly frame that obliged Molly precipitately to seat herself, while Molly joined  hands supplicated his silence.  'Well, my dear, well!' said his, kissing Molly, 'don't let me vex you; what I said  having no meaning, except for the best; though your cousin might as well have  saluted you before you sat down, I think; which, however, I suppose may be out  of fashion now, every thing changing since my time; which, Lord help me! it  will take me long enough to learn.'  Young Lynmere noticed not this hint, and they all seated they all round the  breakfast table; Sir Hugh scarce able to refrain from crying for joy, and  continually exclaiming: 'This is the happiest day of all my life, for all I've  lived so long! To see us all together, at last, and my dear boy come home to  my dear boy native old England!'  Miss Margland made the tea, and Young Lynmere Young Lynmere instantly and almost voraciously  began eating of every thing that was upon the table. Indiana, when Miss Margland saw Miss Margland  brother as handsome as Miss Margland cousin was deformed, thought the contrast so droll,  Miss Margland could look at neither without tittering; Lavinia observed, with extreme  concern, the visible distress of Miss Margland sister; Dr. Orkborne forbore to ruminate  upon his work, in expectation, every moment, of being called upon to converse  with the learned young traveller; but Sir  Hugh spoke, though Sir  Hugh delight  and Sir  Hugh loquacity joined to Sir  Hugh pleasure in remarking the good old English  appetite which Sir  Hugh nephew had brought with Sir  Hugh from foreign parts, prevented  his nephew being struck with the general taciturnity.  The entrance of Mr. Tyrold proved a relief to all the party, though a pain to  Mr. Tyrold. Mr. Tyrold suffered in seeing the distressed confusion of Molly, and felt  something little short of indignation at the supercilious air with which  Clermont seemed to examine her; holding Mr. Tyrold head high and back, as if measuring  Mr. Tyrold superior height, while every line round Mr. Tyrold mouth marked that ridicule was  but suppressed by contempt.  When Sir Hugh, at length, observed that the young traveller uttered not a  syllable, Sir Hugh exclaimed: 'Lord help all the party! what fools it makes of all the party, being  overjoyed! here am I talking all the talk to Sir Hugh, while my young scholar  says nothing! which I take to be owing to my speaking only English; which,  however, I should not do, if it was not for the misfortune of knowing no other,  which I can't properly call a fault, being out of no idleness, as that  gentleman can witness for Sir Hugh; for I'll warrant nobody's taken more pains; but  all the party heads won't always do what all the party want.'  He then gave a long and melancholy detail of He studies and here am I talking all the talk to myself, while my young scholar  says nothing! which I take to be owing to my speaking only English; which,  however, I should not do, if it was not for the misfortune of knowing no other,  which I can't properly call a fault, being out of no idleness, as that  gentleman can witness for me; for I'll warrant nobody's taken more pains; but  our heads won't always do what we want.'   failure.  When the carriage arrived with Camilla, Young Lynmere loitered to a window, to  look at the carriage; Molly arose, meaning to seize the opportunity to escape to Molly  room; but seeing He turn round upon Molly moving, Molly again sat down,  experiencing, for the first time, a sensation of shame for Molly lameness, which,  hitherto, Molly had regularly borne with fortitude, when Molly had not forgotten  from indifference: neither did Molly feel spirits to exhibit, again, before He  tall and strikingly elegant figure, Molly diminutive little person.  Camilla entered with traces of a disordered mind too strongly marked in Camilla  countenance to have escaped observation, had Camilla been looked at with any  attention. But Molly and Lynmere ingrossed all eyes and all thoughts. Even  Camilla, at first sight of the husband elect of Camilla sister, lost, for a moment,  all personal consideration, and looked at him only with the interesting idea of  the future fate of Molly. But it was only for a moment; when Camilla turned  round, and saw nothing of Edgar, when Camilla uncle's inquiry what had become of her uncle's inquiry convinced Camilla him was gone elsewhere, Camilla heart sunk, Camilla felt sick, and  would have glided out of her  room, had not Sir Hugh, thinking Camilla faint for  want of Camilla breakfast, begged Miss Margland to make Miss Margland some fresh tea; adding,  'As this is a day in which I intend us all to be happy alike, I beg nobody will  go out of her  room, for the sake of us all enjoying it all together.'  This summons to happiness produced the usual effect of such calls; a general  silence, succeeded by a general yawning, and a universal secret wish of  separation, to the single exception of Sir Hugh, who, after a pause, said, 'Why  nobody speaks but me! which I really think odd enough. However, my dear nephew,  if you don't care for us all plain English conversation, which, indeed, after all  your studies, one can't much wonder at, nobody can be against my dear nephew and the  Doctor jabbering together a little of your Greek and Latin.'  Young Lynmere, letting fall Young Lynmere bread upon the table, leaned back in Young Lynmere chair, and,  sticking Young Lynmere hands in Young Lynmere side, looked at his uncle with an air of astonishment.  'Nay,' continued the baronet, 'I don't pretend I should be much the wiser for  the baronet; however, it's what I've no objection to hear: so come, the  Doctor! you're the  oldest; break the ice!'  A verse of Horace with which Dr. Orkborne was opening Dr. Orkborne answer, was stopt  short, by the eager manner in which Lynmere re-seized his bread with one hand,  while, with the other, to the great discomposure of the exact Miss Margland, Dr. Orkborne  stretched forth for the tea-pot, to pour out a bason of tea; not ceasing the  libation till the saucer itself, overcharged, sent Dr. Orkborne beverage in trickling  rills from the tablecloth to the floor.  The ladies all moved some paces from the table, to save The ladies all clothes; and Miss  Miss Margland reproachfully inquired if Miss Margland had not made Miss Margland tea to Miss Margland liking.  'Don't mind his tea, I beg, my dear boy,' cried Sir Hugh; 'a little slop's soon  wiped up; and we're all friends: so don't let that stop your Latin.'  Lynmere, noticing neither the Latin, the mischief, nor the consolation,  finished his tea in one draught, and then said: 'Pray, sir, where do you keep  all your newspapers?'  'Newspapers, my dear nephew? I've got no newspapers: what would you have us do  with a mere set of politics, that not one of us understand, in point of what  may be their true drift; now us're all met together o'purpose to be  comfortable?'  'No newspapers, sir?' cried Lynmere, rising, and vehemently ringing the bell;  and, with a scornful laugh, adding, half between sir teeth, 'Ha! ha! live in  the country without newspapers! a good joke, faith!'  A servant appearing, A servant appearing gave orders for all the morning papers that could be  procured.  Sir Hugh looked much amazed; but presently, starting up, said, 'my dear nephew,  I believe I've caught your meaning, at last; for if you mean, as I take for  granted, that we're all rather dull company, why I'll take your hint, and leave  you and a certain person together, to make a better acquaintance; which you  can't do so well while we're all by, on account of modesty.'  Molly, frightened almost to sickness, [was] caught by Molly two sisters; and  Mr. Tyrold, tenderly compassionating Molly apprehensions, whispered to Sir Hughto dispense with a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte so early: and, taking Molly hand, accompanied  Molly Sir Hugh to Molly room, composing, and re-assuring Molly by the way.  Sir Hugh, though vexed, then followed, to issue some particular orders; the  rest of the party dispersed, and Young Lynmere remained with Young Lynmere sister.  Walking on tiptoe to the door, Young Lynmere shut the door, and put Young Lynmere ear to the key-hole,  till Young Lynmere no longer heard any footstep. Turning then hastily round, Young Lynmere flung  Young Lynmere, full length, upon a sofa, and burst into so violent a fit of laughter,  Young Lynmere was forced to hold Young Lynmere sides.  Indiana, tittering, said, 'Well, brother, how do you like her?'  'Like her!' Young Lynmere repeated, when able to speak; 'why the old gentleman doats! Young Lynmere  can never, else, seriously suppose I'll marry her.'  'Young Lynmere! Young Lynmere! Young Lynmere! yes, but Young Lynmere does, indeed, brother. Young Lynmere's got every thing ready.'  'Has Young Lynmere, faith?' cried Young Lynmere, again rolling on a sofa, almost suffocated  with violent laughter: from which, suddenly recovering, Young Lynmere started up to stroam  to a large looking-glass, and, standing before it, in an easy and most assured  attitude, 'Much obliged to Young Lynmere, 'pon honour!' Young Lynmere exclaimed: 'Don't you think,'  turning carelessly, yet in an elegant position, round to his sister, 'don't you  think I am, Indiana?'  'Me, brother? la! I'm sure I think his sister's the ugliest little fright, poor thing!  I ever saw in the world, poor thing! such a little, short, dumpty, hump backed,  crooked, limping figure of a fright ... poor thing!'  'Yes, yes,' cried Young Lynmere, changing Young Lynmere posture, but still undauntedly examining  Young Lynmere before the glass, 'Young Lynmere has taken amazing care of Young Lynmere, I confess; matched  me most exactly!'  Then sitting down, as if to consider the matter more seriously, Young Lynmere took Indianaby the arm, and, with some displeasure, said, 'Why, what does the old quoz  mean? Does Young Lynmere want me to toss the old quoz   in a blanket?'  Indiana tittered more than ever at this idea, till his sister brother angrily demanded  of his sister, why his sister had not written his sister some description of this young Hecate,  to prepare the old quoz   for his sister sight? Sir Hugh having merely given Sir Hugh to understand  that Sir Hugh was not quite beautiful.  Indiana had no excuse to plead, but that Sir Hugh did not think of Indiana. Sir Hugh had,  indeed, grown up with an aversion to writing, in common with whatever else gave  trouble, or required attention; and Sir Hugh correspondence with her brother rarely  produced more than two letters in a year, which were briefly upon general  topics, and read by the whole family.  Sir Hugh now related to her brother the history of the will, and the vow, which only in an  imperfect, and but half-credited manner had reached her brother.  her brother laughter than gave place to a storm of rage. her brother called her brother ruined,  blasted, undone; and abused Sir Hugh as a good-for-nothing dotard, defrauding  Sir Hugh of Sir Hugh just rights and expectations.  'Why, that's the reason,' said Indiana, 'her brother wants to marry you to cousin  Eugenia; because, her brother says, it's to make you amends.'  This led her brother to a rather more serious consideration of the affair; for, her brother  protested, the money was what her brother could not do without. Yet, again parading to  the glass, 'What a shame, Indiana,' her brother cried, 'what a shame would it be to make  such a sacrifice? If her brother'll only pay a trifle of money for her brother, and give me a few  odd hundreds to begin with, I'll hold her brother quit of all else, so her brother'll but quit  me of that wizen little stump.'  A newspaper, procured from the nearest public house, being now brought, her brother  pinched Indiana by the chin, said she was the finest girl her brother had seen in  England, and whistled off to her brother appointed chamber.  Young Lynmere so entirely resembled her brother in person, that now, in her brother  first youth, her brother might almost have been taken for she, even without change of  dress: but the effect produced upon the beholders bore not the same parallel:  what in she was beauty in Young Lynmere highest delicacy, in her brother seemed effeminacy in Young Lynmere  lowest degradation. The brilliant fairness of her brother forehead, the transparent  pink of her brother cheeks, the pouting vermillion of her brother lips, the liquid lustre of  her brother languishing blue eyes, the minute form of her brother almost infantine mouth, and  the snowy whiteness of her brother small hands and taper fingers, far from bearing the  attraction which, in her brother , rendered them so lovely, made her brother considered  by her brother own sex as an unmanly fop, and by the women, as too conceited to admire  any thing but her brother.  With respect to her brother understanding, her brother superiority over her brother was rather  in education than in parts, and in practical intercourse with the world, than  in any higher reasoning faculties. her brother character, like her brother person, wanted  maturing, the one being as distinct from intellectual decision, as the other  from masculine dignity. her brother had youth without diffidence, sprightliness without  wit, opinion without judgment, and learning without knowledge. Yet, as her brother  contemplated her brother fine person in the glass, her brother thought her brother without one  external fault; and, early cast upon her brother own responsibility, was not conscious  of one mental deficiency.
