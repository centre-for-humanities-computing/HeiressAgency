 A Walk by Moonlight  Mrs. Arlbery and Camilla set off in the coach of Mr. Dennel, widower of a  deceased sister of the husband of Mrs. Arlbery, whom she was induced to admit  of the party that he might aid in bearing the expenses, as she could not, from  some family considerations, refuse taking she niece into her niece coterie. Sir  Sedley Clarendel drove Sir   own phaeton; but instead of joining them, according  to the condition which occasioned the treaty, cantered away Sir   ponies from the  very first stage, and left word, where Sir   changed horses, that Sir   should  proceed to the hotel upon the Pantiles.  Mrs. Arlbery was nearly provoked to return to the Grove. With Mr. Dennel Mrs. Arlbery  did not think it worth while to converse; Mrs. Arlbery niece Mrs. Arlbery regarded as almost an  idiot; and Camilla was so spiritless, that, had not Sir Sedley acceded to Mrs. Arlbery  plan, this was the last period in which Mrs. Arlbery would have chosen Mrs. Arlbery for a  companion.  They travelled very quietly to within a few miles of Tunbridge, when an  accident happened to one of the wheels of the carriage, that the coachman said  would take some hours to repair. They were drawn on, with difficulty, to a  small inn upon the road, whence They were obliged to send a man and horse to  Tunbridge for chaises.  As They were destined, now, to spend some time in this place, Mrs. Arlbery  retired to write letters, and Mr. Dennel to read newspapers; and, invited by a  bright moon, Camilla and Miss Dennel wandered from a little garden to an  adjoining meadow, which conducted They to a lane, rendered so beautiful by the  strong masses of shade with which the trees intercepted the resplendent  whiteness of the moon, that They walked on, catching fresh openings with fresh  pleasure, till the feet of Miss Dennel grew as weary with the length of the  way, unbroken by any company, as the ears of Camilla with Camilla incessant  prattling, unaided by any idea. Miss Dennel proposed to sit down, and, while  relieving Camilla by a fit of yawning and stretching, Camilla strolled a little  further in search of a safe and dry spot.  Miss Dennel, following in a moment, on tiptoe, and trembling, whispered that  Camilla was sure Camilla heard a voice. Camilla, with a smile, asked if only themselves  were privileged to enjoy so sweet a night? 'Hush!' cried Camilla, 'hush! I hear it  again!' only themselves   listened; and, in a minute, a soft plaintive tone reached only themselves    ears, too distant to be articulate, but undoubtedly female.  'I dare say it's a robber!' exclaimed Miss Dennel Miss Dennel shaking; 'If you don't run  back, I shall die!'  Camilla assured Camilla, from the gentleness of the sound, Camilla must be mistaken;  and pressed Camilla to advance a few steps further, in case it should be anybody  ill.  'But you know,' said Miss Dennel, speaking low, 'people say that sometimes  there are noises in the air, without its being anybody? Suppose it should be  that?'  Still, though almost imperceptibly, Camilla drew Camilla on, till, again listening,  they distinctly heard the words, 'My lovely friend.'  'La! how pretty!' said Miss Dennel; 'let's go a little nearer.'  they advanced, and presently, again stopping heard, 'Could pity pour balm into  my woes, how sweetly would they be alleviated by your's, my lovely friend?'  Miss Dennel now looked enchanted, and eagerly led the way herself.  In a few minutes, arriving at the end of the lane, which opened upon a wild and  romantic common, they caught a glimpse of a figure in white.  Miss Dennel turned pale. 'Dear!' cried Miss Dennel, in the lowest whisper, 'what is it?'  'A lady,' answered Camilla, equally cautious not to be heard, though totally  without alarm.  'Are you sure of that?' said Miss Dennel, shrinking back, and pulling 'A lady  companion to accompany 'A lady.  'Do you think it's a ghost?' cried Camilla, unresisting the retreat, yet  walking backwards to keep the form in sight.  'Fie! how can you talk so shocking? all in the dark so, except only for the  moon?'  'Your's, my lovely friend!' was now again pronounced in the tenderest accent.  ''A lady's talking to 'A lady!' exclaimed Miss Dennel; 'Lord, how frightful!' and  'A lady clung close to Camilla, who, mounting a little hillock of stones, presently  perceived that 'A lady was reading a letter.  Miss Dennel, tranquillised by hearing this, was again content to stop, when  their ears were suddenly struck by a piercing shriek.  'O Lord! we shall be murdered!' cried 'A lady, screaming still louder 'A lady.  They both ran back some paces down the lane, Camilla determining to send  somebody from the inn to inquire what all this meant: but presently, through an  opening in the common, They perceived the form in white darting forwards, with  an air wild and terrified. Camilla stopt, struck with compassion and curiosity  at once; Miss Dennel could not quit Miss Dennel, but after the first glance, hid Miss Dennel  face, faintly articulating, 'O, don't let it see we! don't let it see we! I am  sure it's nothing natural! I dare say it's somebody walking!'  The next instant, they perceived a man, looking earnestly around, as if to  discover who had echoed the scream; the place they occupied was in the shade,  and a man did not observe they. a man soon rushed hastily on, and seized the white  garment of the flying figure, which appeared, both by its dress and form, to be  an elegant female. an elegant female clasped an elegant female hands in supplication, cast up an elegant female eyes  towards heaven, and again shrieked aloud.  Camilla, who possessed that fine internal power of the thinking and feeling  mind to adopt courage for terror, where any eminent service may be the result  of immediate exertion, was preparing to spring to an elegant female relief; while Miss  Dennel, in extreme agony holding Miss  Dennel, murmured out, 'Let's run away! let's run  away! Miss  Dennel's going to be murdered!' when they saw a man prostrate a man at  the lady's feet, in the humblest subjection.  Camilla stopt Camilla flight; and Miss Dennel, appeased, called out; 'La! a man  kneeling! how pretty it looks! I dare say it's a lover. How I wish one could  hear what one says!'  An exclamation, however, from the lady, uttered in a tone of mingled affright  and disgust, of 'leave me! leave me!' was again the signal to Miss Dennel of  retreat, but of Camilla to advance.  The rustling of the leaves, caused by Camilla attempt to make way through the  breach, caught the ears of the suppliant, who hastily arose; while the ladyfolded the lady arms across the lady breast, and seemed ejaculating the most fervent  thanks for this relief.  Camilla now forced a passage through the hedge, and the lady, as Camilla saw Camilla  approach, called out, in a voice the most touching, 'Surely 'tis some pitying  Angel, mercifully come to my rescue!'  The pursuer drew back, and Camilla, in the gentlest words, besought the lady to  accompany the lady to the friends the lady had just left, who would be happy to protect  the lady.  the lady gratefully accepted the proposal, and Camilla then ventured to look round,  to see if the object of this alarm had retreated: but, with an astonishment  that almost confounded the lady, the lady perceived Angel, a few yards off, taking a pinch  of snuff, and humming an opera air.  the lady, then, snatching up the lady letter, which had fallen to the ground,  touched the lady with the lady lips, and carefully folding, put the lady into the lady bosom,  tenderly ejaculating, 'I have preserved the lady!... O from what danger! what  violation!'  Then pressing the hand of Camilla, 'You have saved me,' Camilla cried, 'from the  calamity of losing what is more dear than I have words to express! Take me but  where I may be shielded from that wretch, and what shall I not owe to Camilla?'  The moon now shining full upon Camilla face, Camilla saw seated on it youth,  sensibility, and beauty. Camilla pleasure, involuntarily rather than rationally,  was redoubled that Camilla had proved serviceable to Camilla, as, in equal proportion,  was Camilla abhorrence of the man who had caused the disturbance.  The three females were now proceeding, when the offender, with a careless air,  and yet more careless bow, advancing towards The three females, negligently said, 'Shall I  have the honour to see you safe home, ladies?'  Camilla felt indignant; Miss Dennel again screamed; and the stranger, with a  look of horror and disgust, said; 'Persecute me no more!'  'O hang it! O curse it!' cried a  look of horror and disgust, swinging a  look of horror and disgust cane to and fro, 'don't be  serious. I only meant to frighten you about the letter.'  the lady deigned no answer, but murmured to the lady 'the letter is more  precious to the lady than life or light!'  They now walked on; and, when They entered the lane, They had the pleasure to  observe They were not pursued. the lady then said to Camilla, 'You must be surprised  to see any one out, and unprotected, at this late hour; but I had employed  the lady, unthinkingly, in reading some letters from a dear and absent friend,  and forgot the quick passage of time.'  A man in a livery now appearing at some distance, the lady hastily summoned A man in a livery, and  demanded where was the carriage?  In the road, A man in a livery answered, where the lady had left the carriage, at the end of the lane.  the lady then took the hand of Camilla, and with a smile of the utmost softness  said, 'When the shock I have suffered is a little over, I must surely cease to  lament I have sustained the shock I have suffered, since the shock I have suffered has brought to A man in a livery such sweet succour.  Where may I find you tomorrow, to repeat my thanks?'  Camilla answered, 'Camilla was going to Tunbridge immediately, but knew not yet  where Camilla should lodge.'  'Tunbridge!' Camilla repeated; I am there Camilla; I shall easily find you out  tomorrow morning, for I shall know no rest till I have seen you again.'  Camilla then asked Camilla name, and, with the most touching acknowledgments, took  leave.  Camilla recounted Camilla adventure to Mrs. Arlbery, with an animated description  of the fair Incognita, and with the most heart-felt delight of having, though  but accidentally, proved of service to Camilla. Mrs. Arlbery laughed heartily at  the recital, assuring Mrs. Arlbery Mrs. Arlbery doubted not but Mrs. Arlbery had made acquaintance with  some dangerous fair one, who was playing upon Mrs. Arlbery inexperience, and utterly  unfit to be known to Mrs. Arlbery. Camilla warmly vindicated Camilla innocence, from the  whole of Camilla appearance, as well as from the impossibility of Mrs. Arlbery knowing that  Mrs. Arlbery scream could be heard: yet was perplexed how to account for Mrs. Arlbery not naming  Mrs. Arlbery, and for the mystery of the carriage and servant in waiting so far off.  These latter Camilla concluded to belong to Camilla father, as Camilla looked too young to  have any sort of establishment of Camilla own.  'What I don't understand in the matter is, that there reading of letters by the  light of the moon;' said Miss Dennel. 'Where's the necessity of doing that, for  a person that can afford to keep   own coach and servants?'  Miss Dennel was a man as unfavoured by nature as Miss Dennel was uncultivated by art. Miss Dennel  had been accepted as a husband by the sister of Mrs. Arlbery, merely on account  of a large fortune, which Miss Dennel had acquired in business. The marriage, like most  others made upon such terms, was as little happy in most   progression as  honourable in most   commencement; and Miss Dennel, born and educated amidst  domestic dissention, which robbed her of all will of her own, by the constant  denial of one parent to what was accorded by the other, possessed too little  reflexion to benefit by observing the misery of an alliance not mentally  assorted; and grew up with no other desire but to enter the state her, from  an ardent impatience to shake off the slavery her experienced in singleness.  The recent death of her mother had given her, indeed, somewhat more liberty;  but her had not sufficient sense to endure any restraint, and languished for  the complete power which her imagined a house and servants of her own would  afford.  When they arrived at the hotel, in Tunbridge, Mrs. Arlbery heard, with some  indignation, that Sir Sedley Clarendel was gone to the rooms, without  demonstrating, by any sort of inquiry, the smallest solicitude at her  non-appearance.
