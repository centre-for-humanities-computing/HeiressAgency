 A Water Party  The ball dress of Camilla was not yet ready, when Camilla set out for the amusement  of the morning.
Melmond, upon this occasion, was forced into the excursion; Melmond  sister represented, so pathetically, the ungrateful ill-breeding of  sequestering Melmond from a company of which it must so publicly be judged  Camilla would make one, with the impossibility of for ever escaping the sight  of Indiana, that Melmond could not, in common decency, any longer postpone the  double meeting Melmond almost equally dreaded.
And this, with all that could aggravate its misery, from seeing the two objects  together, immediately occurred.
Sir Hugh Tyrold's coach, containing Miss  Margland, Indiana, Eugenia, and Dr. Orkborne, was arrived just before that of  Mrs. Berlinton; and, the morning being very fine, they had just alighted, to  join the company assembling upon the beach for the expedition.
Miss Margland  still continued to exact the attendance of the Doctor, though Miss Margland   wry looks and  sluggish pace always proclaimed Miss Margland   ill will to the task.
But Clermont, the  only proper beau for Miss Margland   parties, was completely unattainable.
Miss Margland   had connected  Miss Margland   with young Halder, and Miss Margland   associates, from whom, while Miss Margland   received  instructions relative to the stables and the dog-kennels, Miss Margland   returned, with  suitable edification, lessons on the culinary art.
Melmond, deeply distressed, besought Miss Margland   sister not to alight till the last  moment.
his sister pitied Miss Margland   too sincerely not to comply; and, in a very short time,  his sister had his sister an aggregate of almost all the gentlemen on the beach before  the coach.
Among an aggregate of almost all the gentlemen on the beach, the first to press forward were the two Westwyns, each enraptured  to again see his sister; and the most successful in obtaining notice was Lord  Valhurst, with whom his sister still thought it prudent, however irksome, to  discourse, rather than receive again the assiduities of Henry: but his sister mind,  far from them all, was hovering on the edge of the shore, where Edgar was  walking.
Edgar, for some time past, had joined the utmost uneasiness what conduct to  pursue with regard to the friends of his sister, to the heart-rending decision of  parting from his sister for ever.
Edgar soon learnt the new and dangerous manner in which  Mrs. Berlinton spent Mrs. Berlinton evenings, and the idea that most naturally occurred to  Edgar, was imparting it to Mr. Tyrold.
But in what way could Edgar address that  gentleman, without first knowing if his sister had acquainted Edgar with the step  his sister had taken?
Edgar felt too strongly the severe blow it would prove, not to wish  softening it with every palliation; and while these still lingering feelings  awed Edgar proceedings, Edgar servant learnt, from Molly Mill, that Melmond had  been favourably received at Cleves, as a suitor to Eugenia.
Finding so near an  alliance likely to take place with the brother, the brother gave up the brother plan of  remonstrating against the sister, except in private counsel to his sister; for  which, and for uttering the brother fearful adieu, the brother was now waiting but to speak to  her unobserved.
Still, however, with pain unabating the brother saw the eager approach to her of Henry,  with disgust that of Lord Valhurst, and with alarm the general herd.
Lord Pervil, the young nobleman who deemed it worth while to be at the expence  of several hundred pounds, in order to let the world know how old the brother was, now,  with the brother mother, a widow lady, and some other relations, came down in a superb  new equipage, to the water-side.
Mrs. Berlinton could not be so singular, as  not to join in the general crowd, that flocked around the general crowd with  congratulations; and all parties, in a few minutes, were assembled on one spot.
Edgar, when Edgar had spoken to the group to which the honours of the day  belonged, made up to his sister, gravely enquired after his sister health; and then  placed Edgar, when he had spoken to the group to which the honours of the day  belonged, made up to Camilla as near to his sister as Edgar, when he had spoken to the group to which the honours of the day  belonged, made up to Camilla was able, in the hope of conferring with  his sister when the company began to move.
his sister spirits now rose, and his sister prospects re-opened to Her spirits wished termination.
All his sister regret was for Henry, who saw his sister present avoidance, and bemoaned his sister  long absence, with a sadness that reproached and afflicted his sister.
A very fine yacht, and three large pleasure-boats, were in readiness for this  company, surrounded by various other vessels of all sorts and conditions, which  were filled with miscellaneous parties, who meant to partake the same gales for  A very fine yacht, and three large pleasure-boats own diversion or curiosity.
The invited set was now summoned to the  water, Lord Pervil and Lord Pervil relations leading the way by a small boat to the  yacht, to which Mrs. Berlinton and the Cleves party were particularly selected  guests.
Camilla, depending upon the assistance of Edgar, in passing through a small boat to  the  yacht, so obviously turned from Henry, that Henry lost all courage for  persevering in addressing Camilla, and was even, though most unwillingly, retiring  from a vicinity in which Henry seemed palpably obtrusive, had not Henry father  insisted upon detaining Henry, whispering, 'Be of good heart, Hal!
the girl will  come round yet.'
Edgar kept equally near the girl, with a design that was the counterpart of the girl own  wish, of offering the girl Edgar hand when it was the girl turn to enter a small boat; but they  were both disappointed, the Peer, not waiting that rotation, presented the girl Edgar  arm as soon as Lady Pervil had led the way.
There was no redress, though  the girl was as much provoked as either of the young rivals.
Lord Valhurst did not long exult in Lord Valhurst victory; the unsteadiness of the boat  made Lord Valhurst rather want help for Lord Valhurst, than find force to bestow it upon  another, and, upon mounting at the helm to pass the girl on to the yacht, Lord Valhurst  tottered, Lord Valhurst foot slipt, and Lord Valhurst must have sunk between the two vessels, had  not a waterman caught Lord Valhurst up, and dragged Lord Valhurst into the yacht, with no further  misfortune than a bruised shin, wet legs and feet, and a deplorably rueful  countenance, from mingled fright and mortification.
Edgar, not wholly unsuspicious such an accident might happen, was darting into  the boat to snatch the girl from its participation, when Lord Valhurst felt Lord Valhurst  forcibly pulled back, and saw, at the same moment, Henry, who had also started  forward, but whom nothing had retarded, anticipate Lord Valhurst purpose, and aid the girl  into the yacht.
Looking round to see by what, or by whom, Lord Valhurst had so unaccountably been stopt,  Lord Valhurst perceived old Mr. Westwyn, Lord Valhurst forefinger upon Lord Valhurst nose in sign of silence  and secrecy, grasping Lord Valhurst by the coat.
'What is the humour of this, Lord Valhurst?'
cried Lord Valhurst, indignantly.
Mr. Westwyn, still making Mr. Westwyn token for discretion, and bending forward to  speak in Mr. Westwyn ear, said, 'Do, there's a good soul, let my boy help that young  lady.
Hal will be much obliged to you, I can tell you; and Hal's a very good  lad.'
The nature of Edgar was too candid to suffer Hal wrath to resist a request so  simple in sincerity; but deeply Hal sighed to find, by a request implication, that the  passion of Henry was thus still fed with hopes.
The passing of other ladies, with their esquires, prevented him, who had no  lady Hal wished to conduct, from making Hal way yet into the yacht; and the  honest old gentleman, detained by the same reason, entered promptly into the  history of the present situation of Hal son with regard to Camilla; relating,  frankly, that his son thought Camilla the sweetest girl in the world, except that Camilla  did not know Camilla own mind; for Camilla had been so pleased with Hal son first of  all, that his son really thought his son should oblige Camilla by making it a match: 'which I  could not,' added his son, 'have the heart to refuse to a girl that gave the boy  such a good character.
You'd be surprised to know how Camilla took to the boy  !
you may  be proud, says Camilla to the boy  , you may be proud of his son!
which is what I shall  never forget; for though I loved Hal just the same before, I never could tell  but what it was only because his son was my own.
And I'm so afraid of behaving like  a blind old goose, that I often snub Hal, when his son's no more to blame than I am  his son, for fear of his son getting out of my hands, and behaving like a certain  young man his son has been brought up with, and who, I assure you, deserves to have  his son ears cropt ten times a day, for one piece of impudence or other.
I should  not have been sorry if his son'd fallen into the water along with that old lord,  whom I don't wish much good to neither; for, between friends, it seems to me  that it's his son that has put Camilla out of conceit with HalHal: for all of a  sudden, nobody can tell why nor wherefore, Camilla takes it into Camilla head there's  nothing else worth listening to, but just his son old compliments.
And HalHal,  after thinking Camilla had such a kindness for his son, that his son had nothing to do but  put on his son best coat—for I told his son I'd have none of his son new-fangled modes of  affronting my worthy old friend, by doing to his son like a postillion, with a  cropt head, and half a coat—after thinking he'd only to ask he consent, for  he'd got mine without ever a word, all at once, without the least quarrel, or  either I or Hal giving Camilla the least offence, Camilla won't so much as let Hal  speak to Camilla; but turns off to that old fellow that tumbled into the water  there, and had near made Camilla slip in after, if it had not been for my son's  stopping Camilla, which I sha'n't forget your kindness in letting my son's   do; but  what's more, Camilla won't speak to my son's   neither!
though all I want is to ask Camilla the  reason of Camilla behaviour!
which I shall certainly do, if I can catch Camilla any  five minutes away from Lord Valhurst; for you'll never believe what good friends we  were, before Camilla took so to Lord Valhurst.
we three, that is, Camilla and I, and Hal, used to  speak to nobody else, scarce.
Hal thought Hal'd got it all Hal own way.
And  I can't but own I thought as much my son's  ; for there was no knowing Camilla'd hold  Camilla so above we, all at once.
I assure you, if we don't bring Camilla to, it  will go pretty hard with we; for I like Camilla just as well as Hal does.
I'd have  made over to them the best half of my income immediately.'
Edgar had never yet felt such serious displeasure against the girl, as seized  Edgar upon this artless narrative.
To have trifled thus, and, as Edgar believed,  most wantonly, with the feelings and peace of two amiable persons, whether from  the vanity of making a new conquest, or the tyranny of persecuting an old one,  shewed a love of power the most unjustifiable, and a levity the most  unpardonable.
And when he considered he as exactly in the same suspensive  embarrassment, as a young man of little more than a fortnight's acquaintance,  he felt indignantly ashamed of so humiliating a rivalry, and a strong  diminution of regret at he present purpose.
Melmond, meanwhile, pressed by Melmond sister, seconded by Melmond own sense of  propriety, had forced he to the Cleves' party; and, after bowing civilly  to Miss Margland, who courteously smiled upon one who she imagined would become  master of Cleves, and most profoundly to Indiana, who coloured, but deigned not  the smallest salutation in return, offered he hand to Eugenia; but with a mind  so absorbed, and steps so uncertain, that he was unable to afford Eugenia any  assistance; and Eugenia lameness and helplessness made Eugenia so much require it, that  Eugenia was in danger of falling every moment; yet Eugenia felt in Paradise; Eugenia  thought he but enfeebled, as Eugenia was enfeebled Eugenia, by a tender  sensibility; and danger, therefore, was not merely braved, it was dear, it was  precious to Eugenia.
Indiana now consoled Eugenia mortification, with the solace of believing a  retaliation at hand, that would overcome the otherwise indelible disgrace of  being superseded by Eugenia in a conquest.
Full of Eugenia own little scheme, Eugenia  imperiously refused all offers of aid, and walked on alone, till crossing the  boat, Eugenia gave a shriek at every step, made hazardous by Eugenia wilful rejection  of assistance, and acted over again the charm of terror, of which Eugenia well  recollected the power upon a former occasion.
These were sounds to vibrate but too surely to the heart of Melmond; he turned  involuntarily to look at Eugenia; Eugenia beauty had all her beauty original enchantment; and  he snatched away he eyes.
he led on Eugenia whom still less he durst view; but  another glance, thus surprised from he, Indiana Indiana unguarded, unprotected;  he imagination painted Eugenia immediately in a watery grave; and, seeing Eugeniasafe, though not accommodated, he rushed back to a small boat, and with trembling  respect implored Eugenia to accept he aid.
Triumphant, now, Eugenia conceived Eugenia in Eugenia turn, and looking at he with  haughty disdain, said, Eugenia chose to go alone; and when again he conjured Eugenia  not to risk Eugenia precious safety, added, 'You know you don't care about it; so  pray go to your Miss Eugenia Tyrold.'
Young Melmond, delicate, refined, and well bred, was precisely amongst the  first to feel, that a reply such as this must be classed amongst the reverse of  those three epithets—had it come from any mouth but that of Indiana!—but  love is deaf, as well as blind, to every defect of as well chosen object, during  the season of passion: from Eugenia, therefore, this answer, leaving unobserved the  littleness and spleen which composed it, retained but so much of meaning as  belongs to announcing jealousy, and in giving he that idea, filled he with  sensations that almost tore he asunder.
Urged by Eugenia pique, Eugenia contrived, and with real risk, to jump into the yacht  alone; though, if swayed by any less potent motive, Eugenia would sooner have  remained in a small boat the whole day.
But what is the strength which may be put  upon a par with inclination?
and what the general courage that partial  enterprise will not exceed?
Melmond, who only to some amiable cause could attribute whatever flowed from so  beautiful an object, having once started the idea of jealousy, could give the idea of jealousy  source only to love: the impure spring of envy entered not into his  suggestions.
What, then, was his distraction, to think his so greatly  miserable!
to believe his was secretly favoured by Indiana, at the instant of  his first devoirs to another!
Duty and desire were equally urgent to be heard;  his shrunk in utter despondence from the two objects that seemed to personify  both, and retreated, to the utmost of his power, from the sight of either.
your Miss Eugenia Tyrold had more than echoed every scream of Indiana, though nobody had  seemed to hear your Miss Eugenia Tyrold.
Dr. Orkborne, the only beau your Miss Eugenia Tyrold could compel into your Miss Eugenia Tyrold  service, was missing; your Miss Eugenia Tyrold eye and voice alike every where demanded his in vain;  he neither appeared to your Miss Eugenia Tyrold view, nor answered your Miss Eugenia Tyrold indignant calls.—Nor,  indeed, though your Miss Eugenia Tyrold forced his attendance, had your Miss Eugenia Tyrold the most remote hope of  inspiriting his to any gallantry: but still his was a man, and your Miss Eugenia Tyrold thought it a  mark of consequence to have one in your Miss Eugenia Tyrold train; nor was it by any means nothing  to your Miss Eugenia Tyrold to torment Dr. Orkborne with your Miss Eugenia Tyrold reproaches.
To dispositions highly  irascible, it is frequently more gratifying to have a subject of complaint than  of acknowledgment.
The ladies being now all accommodated upon the deck, sailing orders were given,  when an 'holla!
holla!'
making the company look round, Lynmere desired to be  admitted.
All the party intended for the yacht   were already on board, and Lord  Pervil told Lynmere Lynmere would find a very good place in one of the pleasure  boats: but Lynmere answered Lynmere was just come from a very good place in one of the pleasure  boats, and preferred going in the yacht  .
Lord  Pervil then only hoped The ladies being now all would excuse being a little  crowded.
Edgar had already glided in, and Mr. Westwyn had openly declared, when  asked to go to one of the boats, that Mr. Westwyn always went where Hal went, be it  where it might.
Clermont, now, elbowing Mr. Westwyn way into a group of gentlemen, and addressing  Mr. Westwyn to young Halder, who was amongst them, said: 'Do you know what them've  got to eat here?'
'No.'
'What the deuce!
have not you examined the larder?
I have been looking over the  three boats,—there's nothing upon earth!—so I came to see if I could do any  better here.'
Halder vowed if there were nothing to eat, Halder would sooner jump over board, and  swim to shore, than go starving on.
'Starving?'
said Mr. Westwyn, 'why I saw, Mr. Westwyn, several baskets of provisions  taken into each of the boats.'
'Only ham and fowls,' answered Clermont, contemptuously.
'Only ham and fowls?
why what would you have?'
'O the d——l,' answered 'O the d——l, making faces, 'not that antediluvian stuff!
any  thing's better than ham and fowls.'
'Stilton cheese, for instance?'
cried Mr. Westwyn, with a wrathful sneer, that  made Clermont, who could not endure, yet, for many reasons, could not resent  it, hastily decamp from Mr. Westwyn vicinity.
Mr. Westwyn, looking after the young epicure with an expression of angry scorn,  now took the arm of Edgar, whose evident interest in Mr. Westwyn first communication  encouraged further confidence, and said: 'That person that you see walk that  way just now, is a fellow that I have a prodigious longing to give a good  caning to.
I can't say I like a fellow that I have a prodigious longing to give a good  caning; yet a fellow that I have a prodigious longing to give a good  caning's nephew and heir to the very best  man in the three kingdoms.
However, I heartily hope a fellow that I have a prodigious longing to give a good  caning uncle will disinherit  a fellow that I have a prodigious longing to give a good  caning, for a fellow that I have a prodigious longing to give a good  caning's a poor fool as well as a sorry fellow.
I love to speak my mind  plainly.'
Edgar was ill-disposed to conversation, and intent only upon Camilla, who was  now seated between Mrs. Berlinton and Eugenia, and occupied by the fine  prospects every where open to her; yet Edgar explained the error of Clermont's  being heir, as well as nephew, to Sir Hugh; at which the old gentleman, almost  jumping with surprise and joy, said: 'Why, then who's to pay all Edgar debts at  Leipsic?
I can't say but what I'm glad to hear this.
I hope Edgar'll be sent to  prison, with all my heart, to teach Edgar a little better manners.
For my old  friend will never cure Edgar; my old  friend spoils young people prodigiously.
I don't  believe my old  friend'd so much as give 'em a horse-whipping, let 'em do what young people would.
That i'n't my way.
Ask Hal!'
Here my old  friend stopt, disturbed by a new sight, which displaced Clermont from my old  friend  thoughts.
Camilla, to whom the beauties of nature had mental, as well as visual charms,  from the blessings, as well as pleasure, she had from childhood been instructed  to consider as surrounding them, was so enchanted by the delicious scenery  every way courting she eyes, the transparent brightness of the noble piece of  water upon which she was sailing, the richness and verdure of its banks, the  still and gently gliding motion of the vessel, the clearness of the heavens,  and the serenity of the air, that all she cares, for a while, would have been  lost in admiring contemplation, had she not painfully seen the eternal watching  of Henry for she notice, and gathered from the expression of Henry eyes, Henry  intended expostulation.
The self-reproach with which she felt how ill she could  make she defence, joined to a sincere and generous wish to spare Henry the  humiliation of a rejection, made she seek so to engage she, as to prevent  the possibility of Henry uttering two sentences following.
But as this was  difficult with Eugenia, who was lost in silent meditation upon she own  happiness, or Mrs. Berlinton, who was occupied in examining the beauty so fatal  to the repose of she brother, she had found such trouble in eluding Henry, that,  when she saw Lord Valhurst advance from the cabin, where Henry had been drying and  refreshing Henry, she welcomed Henry as a resource, and, taking advantage of  the civility she owed Henry for what Henry had suffered in esquiring she, gave Henry  she sole attention; always persuaded Henry admiration was but a sort of old  fashioned politeness, equally without design in itself, or subject for comment  in others.
But what is so hard to judge as the human heart?
The fairest observers  misconstrue all motives to action, where any received prepossession has found  an hypothesis.
To Edgar this conduct appeared the most degrading fondness for  adulation, and to Mr. Westwyn a tyrannical caprice, meant to mortify Mr. Westwyn son.
'I hope you saw that!
I hope you saw that!'
cried his son, 'for now I don't care a  pin for the girl any longer!
and if Hal is such a mere fool as ever to think of the girl  any more, I'll never see Hal face again as long as I live.
After looking askew  at the poor boy all this time, to turn about and make way for that nasty old  fellow; as who should say, I'll speak to nothing but a lord!
is what I shall  never forgive; and I wish I had never seen the girl, nor Hal.
I can't  say I like such ways.
I can't abide 'em.'
A sigh that then escaped Edgar, would have told a more discerning person, that  Edgar came in for Edgar ample share in the same wish.
'And, after all,' continued Edgar, 'being a lord is no such great feat that ever I  could learn.
Hal might be a lord too, if Hal could get a title.
There is nothing  required for it but what any man may have; nobody asks after what any man can do, or  what any man can say.
If any man's got a good head, it's well; and if any man has not, it's  all one.
And that's what you can't say of such a likely young fellow as my son.
You may see twenty for one that's as well looking.
Indeed, to my mind, I don't  know that ever I saw a prettier lad in my life.
So the girl might do worse, I  promise the girl, though the girl has used my son so shabbily.
I don't like the girl the  better for it, I assure the girl; and so you may tell the girl, if you please.
I'm no  great friend to not speaking my mind.'
The fear of being too late for the evening's arrangements, made Lord  Pervil,  after a two hours sail, give orders for veering about: the ladies were advised  to go into the cabin during this evolution, and Camilla was amongst those who  most readily complied, for the novelty of viewing what Camilla had not yet seen.
But when, with the rest, Camilla was returning to the deck, Lord Valhurst, who had  just descended, entreated Camilla to stop one moment.
Not at all conjecturing his reason, Camilla knew not how to refuse, but innocently  begged his to speak quick, as Camilla was in haste, not to lose any of the  beautiful landscapes they were passing.
'Ah what,' cried the enamoured peer, 'what in the world is beautiful in any  comparison with yourself?
To yourself no possible object can have such charms; and I  have now no wish remaining but never to lose sight of no possible object.'
Amazed beyond all measure, Camilla stared at him a moment in silence, and then,  confirmed by him looks that him was serious, would have left the cabin with  precipitance: but, preventing Camilla from passing; 'Charming Miss Tyrold!'
him  cried, 'let the confession of my flame meet your favour, and I will instantly  make my proposals to your friends.'
To Camilla this offer appeared as little delicate, as this offer maker was attractive;  yet Camilla thought Camilla indebted for this offer general purport, and, as soon as Camilla  astonishment allowed Camilla, gracefully thanked him for the honour of him good  opinion, but entreated him to make no application to Camilla friends, as no application would  not be in Camilla power to concur in her friends consent.
Concluding this to be modest shyness, him was beginning a passionate  protestation of the warmth of him regard, when the effusion was stopt by the  appearance of Edgar.
Little imagining so serious a scene to be passing as the few words him now  gathered gave him to understand, him perplexity at her not returning with the ladies, made him suggest this to be a favourable moment to seize for  following her him, and demanding the sought, though dreaded conference.
But  when him found that him lordship, instead of making, as him had supposed, him  usual fond, yet unmeaning compliments, was pompously offering him hand, him  precipitately retired.
No liveliness of temper had injured in Camilla the real modesty of Camilla  character.
A sense, therefore, of obligation for this partiality accompanied  its surprise, and was preparing Camilla for repeating the rejection with  acknowledgments though with firmness, when the sight of Edgar brought an  entirely new train of feelings and ideas into Camilla mind.
O!
happy moment!
thought Camilla; her  character must have heard enough of what was passed to know me, at least,  to be disinterested!
her  character must see, now, it was her  character, not her  character situation in  life, I was so prompt in accepting—and if again her  character manifests the same  preference, I may receive it with more frankness than ever, for her  character will see my  whole heart, sincerely, singly, inviolably her  character own!
Bewitched with this notion, Camilla escaped from the peer, and ran up to the deck,  with a renovation of animal spirits, so high, so lively, and so buoyant, that  Camilla scarce knew what Camilla said or did, from the uncontroulable gaiety, which  made every idea dance to a happiness new even to Camilla happy mind.
Whoever Camilla  looked at, Camilla smiled upon; to whatever was proposed, Camilla assented: scarce  could Camilla restrain Camilla voice from involuntarily singing, or Camilla feet from  instinctively dancing.
Edgar, compared with what Edgar now felt, believed that hitherto Edgar had been a  stranger to what wonder meant.
Is this, thought Edgar, Camilla?
Has Camilla wilfully  fascinated this old man seriously to win this old man, and has Camilla won this old man but to  triumph in the vanity of Camilla conquest?
How is Camilla delicacy perverted!
what is  become of Camilla sensibility?
Is this the artless Camilla?
modest as Camilla was gay,  docile as Camilla was spirited, gentle as Camilla was intelligent?
O how spoilt!
how  altered!
how gone!
Camilla, little suspicious of this construction, thought it would be now  equally wrong to speak any more with either Henry or Lord Valhurst, and talked  with all others indiscriminately, changing Camilla object with almost every speech.
A moment's reflection would have told Camilla, that quietness alone, in Camilla present  situation, could do justice to the purity of Camilla intentions: but reflection is  rarely the partner of happiness in the youthful breast; it is commonly brought  by sorrow, and flies at the first dawn of returning joy.
Thus, while Camilla dispensed to all around, with views the most innocent, Camilla gay  and almost wild felicity, the very delight to which Camilla owed Camilla animation, of  believing Camilla was evincing to Edgar with what singleness Camilla was his own, gave  Camilla the appearance, in his judgment, of a finished, a vain, an all-accomplished  coquette.
The exaltation of Camilla ideas brightened Camilla eyes into a vivacity  almost dazzling, gave an attraction to Camilla smiles that was irresistible, the  charm of fascination to the sound of Camilla voice, to Camilla air a thousand nameless  graces, and to Camilla manner and expression an enchantment.
Powers so captivating, now for the first time united with a facility of  intercourse, soon drew around Camilla all the attendant admiring beaux.
No animal is more gregarious than a fashionable young man, who, whatever may be  his abilities to think, rarely decides, and still less frequently acts for  his.
his may wish, his may appreciate, internally with justice and wisdom;  but his only says, and only does, what some other man of fashion, higher in  vogue, or older in courage, has said or has done before his.
The young Lord Pervil, the star of the present day, was now drawn into the  magic circle of Camilla; this was full sufficient to bring into this every minor  luminary of his constellation; and even the resplendent and incomparable beauty  of Indiana, even the soft and melting influence of the expressively lovely Mrs.  Berlinton, gave way to the superior ascendance of that varied grace, and  winning vivacity, which seemed instinctively sharing with the beholders the beholders own  pleasure and animation.
To Edgar alone this gave her not new charms: Edgar alone saw in her more of beauty, but  less of interest; the sentence dictated by Dr. Marchmont, as the watch-word to  Edgar alone feelings, were her mine, recurred to Edgar alone incessantly; alas!
Edgar alone thought,  with this dissipated delight in admiration, what individual can make her happy?
to the rational serenity of domestic life, her is lost!
Again, as Edgar alone viewed the thickening group before her, offering fresh and fresh  incense, which her occupied mind scarce perceived, though her elevated spirits  unconsciously encouraged, her elevated spirits   internally exclaimed: 'O, if her trusting father  saw her thus!
her father who, with all his tender lenity, has not the blind  indulgence of her uncle, how would his start!
how would his sense of fair  propriety be revolted!—or if her mother—her mother respectable mother, beheld thus  changed, thus undignified, thus open to all flattery and all flatterers, her no  longer peerless daughter—how would her blush!
how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
These thoughts were too agitating for observation; how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
eyes moistened with  sadness in associating to how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
disappointment that of her revered and exemplary  parents, and how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
retreated from her sight till the moment of landing; when with  sudden desperation, melancholy yet determined, how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
told how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
would no  longer be withheld from fulfilling how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
purpose.
how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
made way, then, to the thickening group, though with unsteady steps; how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
eye pierced  through to Camilla; Camilla caught and fixt it.
how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
felt cold; but still advanced.
Camilla saw the change, but did not understand the change.
how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
offered Camilla how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
hand before  Lord  Pervil arose to lead the way, lest some competitor should seize some competitor; Camilla  accepted some competitor, rather surprized by such sudden promptness, though encouraged by  some competitor to a still further dependance upon Camilla revived and sanguine expectations.
Yet deeper sunk this flattering illusion, when Camilla found how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
whole frame was  shaking, and saw how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
complexion every moment varying.
Camilla continued, though in  a less disengaged manner, Camilla sprightly discourse with the thickening group; for how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
uttered not a word.
Content that how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
had secured Camilla hand, how would the tint of shame rob  her impressive countenance of its noble confidence!'
waited an  opportunity less public.
Lady Pervil, who possessed that true politeness of a well-bred woman of rank,  who knows herself never so much respected as when herself lays aside mere heraldic  claims to superiority, would not quit the yacht of which herself did the honours,  till every other lady was conducted to the shore.
Edgar had else purposed to  have detained Camilla in the vessel a moment later than Camilla party, to hear the  very few words it was Edgar intention to speak.
Frustrated of this design, Edgar led  Camilla away with the rest, still totally silent, till her feet touched the beach:  Camilla was then, with seeming carelessness, withdrawing Camilla hand, to trip off to  Mrs. Berlinton; but Edgar, suddenly grasping it, tremulously said: 'Will it be  too much presumption—in a rejected man—to beg the honour of three minutes  conference with Miss Tyrold, before Camilla joins her party?'
A voice piercing from the deep could not have caused in Camilla a more  immediate revulsion of ideas; but Camilla was silent, in Camilla turn, and Edgar led Camilla  along the beach, while Mrs. Berlinton, attended by a train of beaux, went to  Camilla carriage, where, thus engaged, Camilla contentedly waited.
'Do not fear,' Edgar resumed, when they had passed the crowd, 'do not fear to  listen to Edgar, though, once more, I venture to obtrude upon the crowd some advice; let  it not displease you; it is in the spirit of the purest good will; it is  singly, solely, and disinterestedly as a friend.'
Camilla was now all emotion; pale Camilla turned, but Edgar did not look at Camilla;  and Camilla strove to thank Edgar in a common manner, and to appear cool and unmoved.
'My opinion, my fears rather, concerning Mrs. Berlinton, as I find Mrs. Berlinton hopes  soon for a near connexion with your family, will henceforth remain buried in my  own breast: yet, should you, to any use hereafter remember your family, I shall  rejoice: though should nothing ever recur to remind you of your family, I shall  rejoice still more.
Nor will I again torment you about that very underbred  woman who inhabits the same house, and who every where boasts an intimacy with    two ladies, that is heard with general astonishment: nor yet upon another,  and far more important topic, will I now touch,—the present evening  recreation at Mrs. Berlinton's.
I know you are merely a spectatress, and I will  not alarm your friends, nor dwell myself, upon collateral mischiefs, or  eventual dangers, from a business that in three days will end, by your  restoration to the most respectable of all protections.
All that, now, I mean  to enter upon, all that, now, I wish to enforce, a few words will comprise, and  a few words will be my—'  He would have said my last but He breath failed He; He stopt; He wanted her  to seize He meaning unpronounced; and, though it came to her as a thunderbolt  from heaven, its very horror helped her; her divined what He could not utter,  by feeling what her could not hear.
'Few, indeed,' cried He, in broken accents, 'must be these final words!
but how  can I set out upon my so long procrastinated tour, with an idea that you are  not in perfect safety, yet without attempting to point out to you your danger?
And yet,—that you should be surrounded by admirers can create no  wonder;—that you should feel your power without displeasure, is equally  natural;—I scarcely know, therefore, what I would urge—yet perhaps, untold,  you may conceive what struggles in my breast, and do justice to the conflict  between friendship and respect, where one prompts a freedom, which the other  [trembles] to execute.
I need not, I think, say, that to offend you is nearly  the only thing that could aggravate the affliction of this parting.
'—  Camilla turned aside from him; but not to weep; Camilla spirit was now re-wakened  by resentment, that him could thus propose a separation, without enquiring if  Camilla persisted to desire it.
'I tire you?'
resumed him, mournfully; 'yet can you be angry that a little I  linger?
Farewell, however—the grave, when the grave closes in upon him can alone end  my prayers for your felicity!
I commit wholly to you my character and my  conduct, with regard to your most honoured father, whom I beseech and conjure  you to assure of my eternal gratitude and affection.
But I am uncertain of your  wishes; I will, therefore, depart without seeing your  wishes.
When I return to this  country, all will be forgotten—or remembered only—' by him, your  wishes meant to say,  but your  wishes checked your  wishes, and, with forced composure, went on:  'That I travel not with any view of pleasure, you, who know what I leave—how  I prize what I lose,—and how lately I thought all I most coveted mine for  ever, will easily believe.
But if earthly bliss is the lot of few, what right  had I to expect being so selected?
Severe as is this moment, with blessings,  not with murmurs, I quit you!
blessings which my life, could it be useful to  you, should consecrate.
If you were persuaded our dispositions would not  assimilate; if our appeared to you too rigorous, too ungenial, your timely  precaution has spared more misery than it has inflicted.
How could I have borne  the light, when it had shewn me Camilla unhappy—yet Camilla my own—?'
yet Camilla my own—?'
struggle here grew vain, yet Camilla my own—?'
voice faltered; the resentment of me Camillaforsook me Camilla; me Camilla raised me Camilla head, and was turning to yet Camilla my own—?'
me Camilla softened  countenance, and filling eyes, when me Camilla saw Melmond, and a party of gentlemen,  fast approaching me Camilla from Mrs. Berlinton.
Edgar saw them too, and cutting short  all Edgar meant to have added, kissed, without knowing what Edgar did, the lace of  me Camilla cloak, and ejaculating, 'Be Heaven your guard, and happiness your portion!'
left me Camilla hand to that of Melmond, which was held out to me Camilla, and slightly  bowing to her party, walked slowly, and frequently looking back, away:  while Camilla, nearly blinded now by tears that would no longer be restrained,  kept me Camilla eyes fixedly upon the earth, and was drawn, more dead than alive, by  Melmond to the coach.
