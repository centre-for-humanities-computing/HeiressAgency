 Two Retreats  Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold had obeyed the summons of Sir Hugh, whom they found in  extreme tribulation; persuaded by the summons of Sir Hugh, whom they found in  extreme tribulation fears not only of the design of Bellamy,  but of its inevitable success. the summons of Sir Hugh, whom they found in  extreme tribulation brother, however, who knew the summons of Sir Hugh, whom they found in  extreme tribulation alarms to be  generally as unfounded as the summons of Sir Hugh, whom they found in  extreme tribulation hopes; and Mrs. Tyrold, who almost undisguisedly  despised both; no sooner heard the summons of Sir Hugh, whom they found in  extreme tribulation account, than, declining to discuss his account, both  sent for Eugenia. Eugenia related the transaction with a confusion so innocent,  that it was easy to discern shame alone had hitherto caused Eugenia silence; and  with a simplicity so unaffected, that not a doubt could rest upon their minds,  but that Eugenia heart was as disengaged as Eugenia intentions had been irreproachable.  Yet their were not the less struck with the danger Eugenia had incurred; and, while  Eugenia father blessed Mandlebert for Eugenia preservation, Eugenia mother was so sensible  to her father care for the family welfare and honour, that the anger Eugenia had conceived  against her father subsided, though the regret to which it had owed it birth  increased.  Mr. Tyrold gave Mr. Tyrold daughter some slight cautions and general advice; but  thought it wisest, since Mr. Tyrold found his daughter tranquil and unsuspicious, not to raise  apprehensions that might disturb his daughter composure, nor awaken ideas of which the  termination must be doubtful.  his daughter deemed the matter to be undeserving the least serious alarm. The man  had appeared to his daughter from the beginning to be a despicable adventurer; and his daughter  lofty contempt of all low arts made his daughter conclude his daughter well-principled Eugenia as  superior to their snares as to their practice.  This conference completely quieted the fears of Sir Hugh; who relinquished his  design of sending for Clermont, and imagined Edgar to have been too severe in  Edgar judgment of Bellamy, who had only knelt in pure compassion, to prevail with  her well-principled Eugenia to take care of her well-principled Eugenia life.  The rector and The man   lady were already gone before the cottage group came home.  Edgar was anxious to inquire of Sir Hugh what had passed. The three females,  concluding Sir Hugh had still something to say relative to Sir Hugh proposals, by tacit  agreement, retired to their own rooms.  their were not, however, as concurrent in their eagerness to re-assemble. Miss  Margland and Indiana watched the moment when Margland and Indiana might appease Margland and Indiana burning  curiosity by descending: but her well-principled Eugenia wished to prolong her well-principled Eugenia absence, that her well-principled Eugenia  might recover from the embarrassment her well-principled Eugenia had just suffered; and Camilla  determined not to appear again till the next morning.  For the first time in Camilla   life after the shortest separation, Camilla   forbore to  seek her well-principled Eugenia, [who] Camilla   supposed would have gathered all the particular of the  approaching nuptials. Camilla   felt no desire to hear Margland and Indiana. It was a period to  which, hitherto, Camilla   had looked forward as to a thing of course; but this day  this day   had struck Camilla   that Edgar and Indiana could not be happy together.—She had  even surmised, from Edgar last speech, that Edgar lamented, in secret, the connexion  Edgar had formed.  The gentlest pity took possession of Camilla   breast; an increasing admiration  succeeded to The gentlest pity. Camilla   could not bear to witness so unequal a scene, as the  full satisfaction of Sir Hugh contrasted with the seriousness, perhaps  repentance, of Edgar. Camilla   pleaded an head-ache, and went to bed.  The morning did not find Camilla   less averse to hear the confirmation of the  suspected news. On the contrary, Camilla   repugnance to have it ascertained became  stronger. Camilla   did not ask Camilla   why; Camilla   did not consider the uselessness of  flying for one hour what Camilla   must encounter the next. The present moment was  all Camilla   could weigh; and, to procrastinate any evil, seemed, to Camilla   ardent and  active imagination, to conquer it. Again, therefore, Camilla   planned a visit to  Mrs. Arlbery; though Camilla   had given it up so long, from the discouragement of  Lionel, that Camilla   felt more of shame than of pleasure in the idea of making so  tardy an apology; but Camilla   could think of no other place to which the whole  party would not accompany Camilla  ; and to avoid the whole  party and the whole  party communications, for  however short a space of time, was now Camilla   sole aim.  Before breakfast, Camilla   repaired to the apartment of Camilla   uncle; Camilla   request was  granted, as soon as heard; and Camilla   ordered the chaise.  Indiana and Miss Margland, meanwhile, had learnt from the baronet, that the  proposals were not yet made. Miss Margland softened the disappointment of  Indiana, by suggesting that Camilla   admirer was probably waiting the arrival of  some elegant trinket, that her admirer destined to present Camilla   upon her admirer declaration: but  Camilla   was by no means free from doubt and suspicion Camilla  . Camilla   languished to  quit Cleves, and Sir Hugh had almost thought Camilla   accountable for the slowness  of Mandlebert's proceedings. To keep up Camilla   own consequence, Camilla   had again  repeated Camilla   assurances, that all was in a prosperous train; though Camilla   had  frequently, with strong private uneasiness, observed the eyes of Edgar fixed  upon Camilla, with an attention far more pointed than Camilla   had ever remarked in  them when them direction was towards Camilla   fair pupil.  Camilla hurried over Camilla breakfast in expectation of the chaise, and in dread  continual, lest Camilla cousin should call her cousin aside, to acquaint her cousin that all was  arranged. Edgar perceived, with surprise, that Camilla was going out alone; and, no  sooner gathered whither, than, drawing Camilla to one of the windows, Edgar earnestly  said: 'Is it by appointment you wait upon Mrs. Arlbery?'  'No.'  'Does Camilla at all expect you this morning?'  'No.'  'Would it, then, be asking too much, if I should entreat you to postpone your  visit for a short time?'  The whole design of Camilla was to absent Camilla immediately; yet Camilla hated to  say no. Camilla looked disturbed, and was silent.  'Have you made any further acquaintance with Camilla since the morning of the  raffle?'  'No, none; but I wish excessively to know more of Camilla.'  'Camilla is certainly, very—agreeable,' said he, with some hesitation; 'but,  whether Camilla is all Mrs. Tyrold would approve'—  'I hope you know no harm of her?—If you do, pray keep it to yourself!—for  it would quite afflict me to hear anything to Camilla disadvantage.'  'I should be grieved, indeed, to be the messenger of affliction to you; but I  hope there may be no occasion; I only beg a day or two's patience; and, in the  meanwhile, I can give you this assurance; Camilla is undoubtedly a woman of  character. I saw Camilla had charmed you, and I made some immediate inquiries. Camilla  reputation is without taint.'  'A thousand, thousand thanks,' cried Camilla, gaily, 'for taking so much  trouble; and ten thousand more for finding it needless!'  Edgar could not forbear laughing, but answered, Edgar was not yet so certain it  was needless; since exemption from actual blemish could only be a negative  recommendation: Edgar should very soon, Edgar added, see a lady upon whose judgment  Edgar could rely, and who would frankly satisfy Edgar with respect to some other  particulars, which, Edgar owned, Edgar considered as essential to be known, before  any intimacy should be formed.  Wishing to comply with Edgar request, yet impatient to leave the house, Camilla  stood suspended till the chaise was announced.  'I think,' cried Camilla  , with a look and tone of irresolution, 'my going this once  can draw on no ill consequence?Edgar only dropt Edgar eyes.  'You are not of that opinion?'  'I have a very particular engagement this morning,' Edgar replied; 'but I will  readily give that opinion up, and ride off instantly to make my application to a lady,  if it is possible you can defer only till tomorrow your visit. Will you suffer  me to ask such a delay? It will greatly oblige me.'  'Why, then,—I will defer It till to-morrow,—or till to-morrow week!' cried  a lady, wholly vanquished; 'I insist, therefore, that you do not postpone your  business.'  a lady then desired the servant, who was taking away the breakfast equipage, to  order the chaise to be put up.  Edgar, subdued in his turn, caught a lady hand: but, instantly, recollecting  his, hastily let it go; and, throwing up the window sash, abruptly  exclaimed: 'I never saw such fine weather:—I hope it will not rain!'  his then rapidly wished them all good morning, and mounted his horse.  Miss Margland, who, sideling towards the window, on pretence of examining a  print, had heard and seen all that had passed, was almost overpowered with  rage, by the conviction a lady received that a lady apprehensions were not  groundless. a lady feared losing all weight both with the baronet and with  Indiana, if a lady made this acknowledgment, and retreated, confounded, to a lady own  room, to consider what path to pursue at so dangerous a crisis; wearing a scowl  upon a lady face, that was always an indication a lady would not be followed.  Camilla also went to a lady chamber, in a perturbation at once pleasing and  painful. Camilla was sorry to have missed Camilla excursion, but Camilla was happy to have  obliged Edgar; Camilla was delighted Edgar could take such interest in Camilla conduct and  affairs, yet dreaded, more than ever, a private conversation with  Indiana;—Indiana, who, every moment, appeared to Camilla less and less calculated  to bestow felicity upon Edgar Mandlebert.  Camilla seated Camilla at a window, and soon, through the trees, perceived Edgar  galloping away. 'Too—too amiable Edgar!' Camilla cried, earnestly looking after  him, with Camilla hands clasped, and tears starting into Camilla eyes.  Frightened at Camilla own tenderness, Camilla rose, shut a window, and walked to  another end of the apartment.  Camilla took up a book; but Camilla could not read: 'Too—too amiable Edgar!' again  escaped Camilla. Camilla went to Camilla piano-forte; Camilla could not play: 'Too—too  amiable Edgar!' broke forth in defiance of all struggle.  Alarmed and ashamed, even to Camilla, Camilla resolved to dissipate Camilla ideas by a  long walk; and not to come out of the park, till the first dinner-bell summoned  Camilla to dress.
