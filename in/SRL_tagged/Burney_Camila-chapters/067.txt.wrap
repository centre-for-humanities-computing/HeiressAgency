 An Accorder  Thus, self-confined and almost in an agony, Camilla remained for a quarter of  an hour, without any species of interruption, and in the greatest amazement  that Lionel forbore pursuing her, either with letter or message.  Another violent ringing at the bell, but still without any carriage, then  excited her attention, and presently the voice and steps of Lionel resounded  upon the stairs, whence her name was with violence vociferated.  She did not move; and in another minute, he was rapping at her chamber door,  demanding admittance, or that she would instantly descend.  Alarmed for her open letter and papers, she inquired who was in the parlour.  'Not a soul,' he answered; 'I have left them all at the Rooms.'  'Have you returned, then, twice?'  'No. I should have been here sooner, but I met two or three old cronies, that  would not part with me. Come, where's your letter?'  'Have you not seen what I have written?'  Down upon this intimation he flew, without any reply; but was presently back,  saying he found nothing in the parlour, except a letter to herself.  Affrighted, she followed him; but not one of her papers remained. The table was  cleared, and nothing was to be seen but a large packet, addressed to her in a  hand she did not know.  She rang to inquire who had been in the house before her brother.  The servant answered, only Sir Sedley Clarendel, who he thought had been there  still, as he had said he should wait till Mrs. Arlbery came home.  'Is it possible,' cried she, 'that a gentleman such as Sir Sedley Clarendel,  can have permitted himself to touch my papers?'  Lionel agreed that it was shocking; but said the loss of time to himself was  still worse; without suffering her, therefore, to open her packet, he insisted  that she should write another letter directly; adding, he had met the Baronet  in his way from the Rooms, but had little suspected whence he came, or how he  had been amusing himself.  Camilla now hung about her brother in the greatest tribulation, but refused to  take the pen he would have put into her hands, and, at last, not without tears,  said: 'Forgive me, Lionel! but the papers you ought to have found would have  explainedâ€”that I cannot write for you to my uncle.'  Lionel heard this with the indignation of an injured man. He was utterly, he  said, lost; and his family would be utterly disgraced, for ruin must be the lot  of his father, or exile or imprisonment must be his own, if she persisted in  such unkind and unnatural conduct.  Terrour now bereft her of all speech or motion, till the letter, which Lionel  had been beating about in his agitation, without knowing or caring what he was  doing, burst open, and some written papers fell to the floor, which she  recognised for her own.  Much amazed, she seized the cover, which had only been fastened by a wafer that  was still wet, and saw a letter within it to herself, which she hastily read,  while a paper that was enclosed dropt down, and was caught by Lionel.  To Miss Camilla Tyrold.  Forgive, fairest Camilla, the work of the Destinies. I came hither to see if  illness detained you; the papers which I enclose from other curious eyes caught  mine by accident. The pathetic sisterly address has touched me. I have not the  honour to know Mr. Lionel Tyrold; let our acquaintance begin with an act of  confidence on his part, that must bind to him for ever his lovely sister's.  Most obedient and devoted           Sedley Clarendel.  The loose paper, picked up by Lionel, was a draft, upon a banker, for two  hundred pounds.  While this, with speechless emotion, was perused by Camilla, Lionel, with  unbounded joy, began jumping, skipping, leaping over every chair, and capering  round and round the room in an ecstasy.  'My dearest Lionel,' cried she, when a little recovered, 'why such joy? you  cannot suppose it possible this can be accepted.'  'Not accepted, child? do you think me out of my senses? Don't you see me freed  from all my misfortunes at once? and neither my father grieved, nor my mother  offended, nor poor numps fleeced?'  'And when can you pay it? And what do you mean to do? And to whom will be the  obligation? Weigh, weigh a little all this.'  Lionel heard her not; his rapture was too buoyant for attention, and he whisked  every thing out of its place, from frantic merriment, till he put the apartment  into so much disorder, that it was scarce practicable to stir a step in it; now  and then interrupting himself to make her low bows, scraping his feet all over  the room, and obsequiously saying: 'My sister Clarendel! How does your La'ship  do? my dear Lady Clarendel, pray afford me your La'ship's countenance.'  Nothing could be less pleasant to Camilla than raillery which pointed out,  that, even by the unreflecting Lionel, this action could be ascribed to but one  motive. The draft, however, had fallen into his hands, and neither remonstrance  nor petition, neither representation of impropriety nor persuasion, could  induce him to relinquish it; he would only dance, sing, and pay her grotesque  homage, till the coach stopt at the door; and then, ludicrously hoping her  Ladyship would excuse his leaving her, for once, to play the part of the  house-maid, in setting the room to rights, he sprang past them all, and bounded  down the hill.  Mrs. Arlbery was much diverted by the confusion in the parlour, and Miss Dennel  asked a thousand questions why the chairs and tables were all thrown down, the  china jars removed from the chimney-piece into the middle of the room, and the  sideboard apparatus put on the chimney-piece in their stead.  Camilla was too much confounded either to laugh or explain, and hastily wishing  them good-night, retired to her chamber.  Here, in the extremest perturbation, she saw the full extent of her  difficulties, without perceiving any means of extrication. She had no hope of  recovering the draft from Lionel, whom she had every reason to conclude already  journeying from Tunbridge. What could she say the next day to Sir Sedley? How  account for so sudden, so gross an acceptance of pecuniary obligation? What  inference might he not draw? And how could she undeceive him, while retaining  so improper a mark of his dependence upon her favour? The displeasure she felt  that he should venture to suppose she would owe to him such a debt, rendered  but still more palpable the species of expectation it might authorise.  To destroy this illusion occupied all her attention, except what was  imperiously seized upon by regret of missing Edgar, with whom to consult was  more than ever her wish.  In this disturbed state, when she saw Mrs. Arlbery the next morning, her whole  care was to avoid being questioned: and that lady, who quickly perceived her  fears by her avoidance, took the first opportunity to say to her, with a laugh,  'I see I must make no inquiries into the gambols of your brother last night:  but I may put together, perhaps, certain circumstances that may give me a  little light to the business: and if, as I conjecture, Clarendel spoke out to  him, his wildest rioting is more rational than his sister's gravity.'  Camilla protested they had not conversed together at all.  'Nay, then, I own myself still in the dark. But I observed that Clarendel left  the Rooms at a very early hour, and that your brother almost immediately  followed.'  Camilla ventured not any reply; and soon after retreated.  Mrs. Arlbery, in a few minutes, pursuing her, laughingly, and with sportive  reproach, accused her of intending to steal a march to the altar of Hymen; as  she had just been informed, by her maid, that Sir Sedley had actually been at  the house last night, during her absence.  Camilla seriously assured her, that she was in her chamber when he arrived, and  had not seen him.  'For what in the world, then, could he come? He was sure I was not at home, for  he had left me at the Rooms?'  Camilla again was silent; but her tingling cheeks proclaimed it was not for  want of something to say. Mrs. Arlbery forbore to press the matter further; but  forbore with a nod that implied I see how it is! and a smile that published the  pleasure and approbation which accompanied her self-conviction.  The vexation of Camilla would have prompted an immediate confession of the  whole mortifying transaction, had she not been endued with a sense of honour,  where the interests of others were concerned, that repressed her natural  precipitance, and was more powerful even than her imprudence.  She waited the greatest part of the morning in some little faint hope of seeing  Lionel: but he came not, and she spent the rest of it with Mrs. Berlinton. She  anxiously wished to meet Edgar in the way, to apologise for her non-appearance  the preceding evening; but this did not happen; and her concern was not  lessened by reflecting upon the superior interest in her health and welfare,  marked by Sir Sedley, who had taken the trouble to walk from the Rooms to Mount  Pleasant to see what was become of her.  She returned home but barely in time to dress for dinner, and was not yet  ready, when she saw the carriage of the Baronet drive up to the door.  In the most terrible confusion how to meet him, what to say about the draft,  how to mention her brother, whether to seem resentful of the liberty he had so  unceremoniously taken, or thankful for its kindness, she had scarce the force  to attire herself, nor, when summoned down stairs, to descend.  This distress was but increased upon her entrance, by the sight and the  behaviour of the Baronet; whose address to her was so marked, that it covered  her with blushes, and whose air had an assurance that spoke a species of secret  triumph. Offended as well as frightened, she looked every way to avoid him, or  assumed a look of haughtiness, when forced by any direct speech to answer him.  She soon, however, saw, by his continued self-complacency, and even an increase  of gaiety, that he only regarded this as coquetry, or bashful embarrassment,  since every time she attempted thus to rebuff him, an arch smile stole over his  features, that displayed his different conception of her meaning.  She now wished nothing so much as a prompt and positive declaration, that she  might convince him of his mistake and her rejection. For this purpose, she  subdued her desire of retreat, and spent the whole afternoon with Mrs. Arlbery  and the Dennels in his company.  Nevertheless, when Mrs. Arlbery, who had the same object in view, though with a  different conclusion, contrived to draw her other guests out of the apartment  and to leave her alone with Sir Sedley, modesty and shame both interfered with  her desire of an explanation, and she was hastily retiring; but the Baronet, in  a gentle voice, called after her, 'Are you going?'  'Yes, I have forgotten something....'  He rose to follow her, with a motion that seemed purporting to take her hand;  but, gliding quickly on, she prevented him, and was almost at the same moment  in her own chamber.  With augmented severity, she now felt the impropriety of an apparent acceptance  of so singular and unpleasant an obligation, which obviously misled Sir Sedley  to believe her at his command.  Shocked in her delicacy, and stung in her best notions of laudable pride, she  could not rest without destroying this humiliating idea; and resolved to apply  to Edgar for the money, and to pay the Baronet the next day. Her objections to  betraying the extravagance of Lionel, though great and sincere, yielded to the  still more dangerous evil of letting Sir Sedley continue in an errour, that  might terminate in branding her in his opinion, with a character of  inconsistency or duplicity.  Edgar, too, so nearly a brother to them both, would guard the secret of Lionel  better, in all probability, than he would guard it himself; and could draw no  personal inferences from the trust and obligation when he found its sole  incitement was sooner to owe an obligation to a ward of her father, than to a  new acquaintance of her own.  Pleased at the seeming necessity of an application that would lead so naturally  to a demand of the counsel she languished to claim, she determined not to  suffer Sir Sedley to wait even another minute under his mistake; but, since she  now could speak of returning the money, to take courage for meeting what might  either precede or ensue in a conference.  Down, therefore, she went; but as she opened the parlour door, she heard Sir  Sedley say to Mrs. Arlbery, who had just entered before her: 'O, fie! fie! you  know she will be cruel to excruciation! you know me destined to despair to the  last degree.'  Camilla, whose so speedy re-appearance was the last sight he expected, was too  far advanced to retreat; and the resentment that tinged her whole complexion  shewed she had heard what he said, and had heard it with an application the  most offensive.  An immediate sensibility to his own impertinence now succeeded in its vain  display; he looked not merely concerned, but contrite; and, in a voice softened  nearly to timidity, attempted a general conversation, but kept his eyes, with  an anxious expression, almost continually fixed upon her's.  Anger with Camilla was a quick, but short-lived sensation; and this sudden  change in the Baronet from conceit to respect, produced a change equally sudden  in herself from disdain to inquietude. Though mortified in the first moment by  his vanity, it was less seriously painful to her than any belief that under it  was couched a disposition towards a really steady regard. With Mrs. Arlbery she  was but slightly offended, though certain she had been assuring him of all the  success he could demand: her way of thinking upon the subject had been openly  avowed, and she did justice to the kindness of her motives.  No opportunity, however, arose to mention the return of the draft; Mrs. Arlbery  saw displeasure in her air, and not doubting she had heard what had dropt from  Sir Sedley, thought the moment unfavorable for a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, and resolutely  kept her place, till Camilla herself, weary of useless waiting, left the room.  Following her then to her chamber, 'My dear Miss Tyrold,' she cried, 'do not  let your extreme youth stand in the way of all your future life. A Baronet,  rich, young, and amiable, is upon the very point of becoming your slave for  ever; yet, because you discover him to be a little restive in the last agonies  of his liberty, you are eager, in the high-flown disdain of juvenile  susceptibility, to cast him and his fortune away; as if both were such  every-day baubles, that you might command or reject them without thought of  future consequence.'  'Indeed no, dear madam; I am not actuated by pride or anger; I owe too much to  Sir Sedley to feel either above a moment, even where I think them ... pardon  me!... justly excited. But I should ill pay my debt, by accepting a lasting  attachment, where certain I can return nothing but lasting, eternal,  unchangeable indifference.'  'You sacrifice, then, both him and yourself, to the fanciful delicacy of a  first love?'  'No, indeed!' cried she blushing. 'I have no thought at all but of the single  life. And I sincerely hope Sir Sedley has no serious intentions towards me; for  my obligations to him are so infinite, I should be cruelly hurt to appear to  him ungrateful.'  'You would appear to him, I confess, a little surprising,' said Mrs. Arlbery,  laughing; 'for diffidence certainly is not his weak part. However, with all his  foibles, he is a charming creature, and prepossession only can blind you to his  merit.'  Camilla again denied the charge, and strove to prevail with her to undeceive  the Baronet from any false expectations. But she protested she would not be  accessary to so much after-repentance; and left her.  The business now wore a very serious aspect to Camilla. Mrs. Arlbery avowed she  thought Sir Sedley in earnest, and he knew she had herself heard him speak with  security of his success. The bullfinch had gone far, but the draft seemed to  have riveted the persuasion. The bird it was now impossible to return till her  departure from Tunbridge; but she resolved not to defer another moment putting  upon her brother alone the obligation of the draft, to stop the further  progress of such dangerous inference.  Hastily, therefore, she wrote to him the following note:  To Sir Sedley Clarendel, Bart.  Sir,  Some particular business compelled my brother so abruptly to quit Tunbridge,  that he could not have the honour to first wait upon you with his thanks for  the loan you so unexpectedly put into his hands; by mine, however, all will be  restored to-morrow morning, except his gratitude for your kindness.  I am, sir, in both our names,                     your obliged humble servant,           Camilla Tyrold.  Mount Pleasant,   Thursday Evening.  She now waited till she was summoned down stairs to the carriage, and then gave  her little letter to a servant, whom she desired to deliver it to Sir Sedley's  man.  Sir Sedley did not accompany them to the Rooms, but promised to follow.  Camilla, on her arrival, with palpitating pleasure, looked round for Edgar. She  did not, however, see him. She was accosted directly by the Major; who, as  usual, never left her, and whose assiduity to seek her favour seemed increased.  She next joined Mrs. Berlinton; but still she saw nothing of Edgar. Her eyes  incessantly looked towards the door, but the object they sought never met them.  When Sir Sedley entered, he joined the group of Mrs. Berlinton.  Camilla tried to look at him and to speak to him with her customary civility  and chearfulness, and nearly succeeded; while in him she observed only an  expressive attention, without any marks of presumption.  Thus began and thus ended the evening. Edgar never appeared.  Camilla was in the utmost amaze and deepest vexation. Why did he stay away? was  his wrath so great at her own failure the preceding night, that he purposely  avoided her? what, also, could she do with Sir Sedley? how meet him the next  morning without the draft she had now promised?'  In this state of extreme chagrin, when she retired to her chamber, she found  the following letter upon her table:  To Miss Camilla Tyrold.  Can you think of such a trifle? or deem wealth so truly contemptible, as to  deny it all honourable employment? Ah, rather, enchanting Camilla! deign  further to aid me in dispensing it worthily!  Sedley Clarendel.  Camilla now was touched, penetrated, and distressed beyond what she had been in  any former time. She looked upon this letter as a positive intimation of the  most serious designs; and all his good qualities, as painted by Mrs. Arlbery,  with the very singular obligation she owed to him, rose up formidably to  support the arguments and remonstrances of that lady; though every feeling of  her heart, every sentiment of her mind, and every wish of her soul, opposed  their smallest weight.
