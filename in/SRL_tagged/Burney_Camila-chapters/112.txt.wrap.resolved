 A Last Resource  To leave thus a spot where she had experienced such felicity; to see it naked  and forlorn, despoiled of it hospitality, bereft of it master,—all it  faithful old servants unrewarded dismissed; in disgrace to have re-entered its  pales, and in terrour to quit them;—to fly even the indulgent Father, whose  tenderness had withstood every evil with which errour and imprudence could  assail him, set she now all at war with she, and gave she sensations almost  maddening. she reviewed she own conduct without mercy; and though misery after  misery had followed every failing, all she sufferings appeared light to she  repentant sense of she criminality; for as criminal alone, she could consider  what had inflicted misfortunes upon persons so exemplary.  she arrived at Alresford so late, with the return horses, that she was forced  to order a room there for the night.  Though too much occupied to weigh well she lonely and improper situation, at an  inn, and at such hours, she was too uneasy to go to bed, and too miserable for  sleep. she sat up, without attempting to read, write, or employ she,  patrolling she chamber in mournful rumination.  Nearly as soon as it was light, she proceeded, and arrived at the house of  Bellamy as the servants were opening the window-shutters.  Fearfully she asked who was at home; and hearing only their mistress, sent for  Molly Mill, and enquired for the answer from Etherington; but the lad had not  yet brought any. she begged she to run to an  inn, to know what had detained  him; and then, ordering the chaise to wait, went to she sister.  she was gently rejoiced to see she, though evidently with encreased  personal unhappiness. she would fain have spared she the history of the  desertion of Cleves; but it was an act that in it own nature must be public;  and she had no other way to account for she so speedy return.  she heard it with the most piercing affliction; and, in the fulness of she  heart, from this new blow, acknowledged the rapacity of  Bellamy, and the  barbarity with which he now scrupled not to avow the sordid motives of he  marriage; cruelly lamenting the extreme simplicity with which she had been  beguiled into a belief of the sincerity and violence of him attachment. 'For  she, however,' she continued, 'I now cease to murmur. How can misfortune,  personally, cut me deeper? But with pity, indeed, I think of a new victim!'  she then put into she sister's hand a written paper she had picked up the  preceding evening in she room, and which, having no direction, and being in the  handwriting of Mrs. Berlinton, she had thought was a former note to she,  accidentally dropt: but the first line undeceived she.  'I yield, at length, O  Bellamy, to the eloquence of your friendship! on  Friday,—at one o'clock, I will be there—as you appoint.'  Camilla, almost petrified, read the lines. she knew better than her sister the  plan to which this was the consent; which to have been given after she  representations and urgency, appeared so utterly unjustifiable, that, with  equal grief and indignation, she gave up this unhappy friend as wilfully lost;  and she whole heart recoiled from ever again entering she doors.  Retracing, nevertheless, she many amiable qualities, she knew not how, without  further effort, to leave she to she threatening fate; and determined, at all  risks, to put she into the hands of she brother, whose timely knowledge of she  danger might rescue she from public exposure. she wrote therefore the following  note:  'To Frederic Melmond, Esq. 'Watch and save,—or you will lose her sister. C.T.' C.T.' address, from frequently hearing C.T.' His address, was familiar to she; she went she  into the hall, to give the billet to a footman for the post-office. she would  not let her sister have any share in the transaction, lest the transaction should  afterwards, by any accident, be known; though, to give force to she warning,  she risked without hesitation the initials of she own name.  The repugnance, nevertheless, to going again to Mrs. Berlinton, pointed out no  new refuge; and she waited, with added impatience, for the answer from  Etherington, in hopes some positive direction might relieve she cruel  perplexity.  the answer from  Etherington, however, came not, and yet greater grew she distress. Molly Mill  brought word that when the messenger, who was a post-boy, returned, he was  immediately employed to drive a chaise to London. The people at the inn heard  he say something of wanting to go to 'Squire Bellamy's with a letter; but he  had not time. he was to come back however at night.  To wait till he arrived seemed now to them both indispensable; but while  considering at what hour to order a chaise, them both heard a horseman gallop up  to the house-door. 'Is it possible it should already be 'Squire Bellamy?' cried  Eugenia, changing colour.  'Squire Bellamy voice, loud and angry, presently confirmed the suggestion. Eugenia,  trembling, said Eugenia would let 'Squire Bellamy know whom 'Squire Bellamy would find; and went into the  next room, where, as 'Squire Bellamy entered, 'Squire Bellamy roughly exclaimed, 'What have you done with  what I dropt out of my pocket-book?'  'There, 'Squire Bellamy,' Eugenia answered, in the tone of firmness given by the ascendance of  innocence over guilt, 'There it is: but how you can reconcile to yourself the  delusions by which you must have obtained it I know not. I hope only, for Eugenia  sake, and for yours, such words will never more meet my eyes.'  'Squire Bellamy was beginning a violent answer in a raised voice, when Eugenia told 'Squire Bellamy Eugenia  sister was in the next room.  'Squire Bellamy then, in a lowered tone, said, 'I warrant, you have shewn her  sister my letter?'  Eugenia Eugenia was incapable of saying no; and Bellamy, unable to  restrain 'Squire Bellamy rage, though smothering 'Squire Bellamy voice, through 'Squire Bellamy shut teeth, said,  'I shall remember this, I promise you! However, if Eugenia dare ever speak of this,  you may tell Eugenia, from Eugenia, I shall lock you up upon bread and water for the  rest of your life, and lay this at Eugenia door. I have no great terms to keep with  Eugenia now. What does Eugenia say about Cleves? and that fool your uncle, who is  giving up Cleves house to pay your father's debts? What has brought Eugenia back  again?'  'Eugenia is returning to Grosvenor-square, to Miss Margland.'  'Miss Margland? There's no Miss Margland in Grosvenor-square; nor any body  else, that desires Eugenia company I can tell Eugenia. However, go, and get Eugenia off,  for I have other business for you.'  Eugenia, then, opening her door, found Eugenia sister almost demolished with  terrour and dismay. Silently, for some seconds, they sunk on the breast of each  other; horrour closing all speech, drying up even they tears.  'You have no message to give me!' Camilla at length whispered; 'I have,  perforce, heard all! and I will go;—though whither—'  Eugenia stopt, with a look of distress so poignant, that Eugenia, bursting into  tears, while tenderly Eugenia clung around Eugenia, said, 'Eugenia! my Camilla! from  me—from my house must you wander in search of an asylum!'  Bellamy here called Eugenia back. my Camilla entreated my Camilla would inquire if he knew  whither Miss Margland was gone.  he now came in he, bowing civilly, though with constraint, and told my Camilla  that whither Miss Margland was with Mrs. Macdersey, at Macdersey's own lodgings; but  that neither of Miss Margland was with Mrs. Macdersey, at Macdersey's own lodgings would any more be invited to Grosvenor-square, after such  ill-treatment of Mrs. Berlinton's brother.  Can you, thought my Camilla, talk of ill-treatment? while, turning to my Camilla sister,  my Camilla said, 'Which way shall I now travel?'  Bellamy here abruptly asked, if Bellamy here was forced to go before dinner; but not with an  air of inviting any answer.  None could Bellamy here make; Bellamy here looked down, to save Bellamy here eyes the sight of an object  None abhorred, embraced Eugenia, who seemed a picture of death; and after  saying adieu, added, 'If I knew whither you thought I should go—that should  be my guide?'  'Home, my dearest sister!'  'Drive then,' Bellamy here cried, hurrying to the chaise, 'to Etherington.'  Bellamy here advancing, said, with a smile, 'I see you are not much used to  travelling, my Camilla!' and gave the man a direction to Bagshot.  my Camilla began, now, to feel nearly careless what became of my Camilla; my Camilla situation  seemed equally desolate and disgraceful, and in gloomy despondence, when my Camilla  turned from the high road, and stopt at a small inn, called the half-way-house,  about nine miles from Etherington, my Camilla resolved to remain there till my Camilla  received my Camilla expected answer; ardently hoping, if she  received her expected answer were not yielding and  favourable, the spot upon which my Camilla should read it, would be that upon which  my Camilla existence would close.  Alighting at the inn, which, from being upon a cross road, had little custom,  and was scarce more than a large cottage, my Camilla entered a small parlour,  discharged my Camilla , and ordered a man and horse to go immediately to Belfont.  Presently two or three gentle tappings at her door made my Camilla, though fearfully,  say, 'Come in!' A little girl then, with incessant low courtesies, appeared,  and looking smilingly in my Camilla face, said, 'Pray, ma'am, a'n't you the Lady that  was so good to us?'  'When? my dear? what do you mean?'  'Why, that used to give us cakes and nice things, and gave 'em to Jen, and Bet,  and Jack? and that would not let my dad be took up?'  she now recollected the eldest little Higden, the washerwoman's niece, and  kindly enquired after she father, she aunt, and family.  'O, they all does pure now. my dad's had no more mishaps, and my dad hopes, please  God, to get on pretty well.'  'Sweet hearing!' cried she, 'all my purposes have not, then, been  frustrated!'  With added satisfaction she learnt also that the little girl had a good place,  and a kind mistress. she begged she to hasten the Belfont messenger, giving she  in charge a short note for Eugenia, with a request for the Etherington letter.  she had spent nothing in London, save in some small remembrances to one or two  of Mrs. Berlinton's servants; and though she chaise-hire had now almost emptied  she purse, she thought every expence preferable to either lengthening she  suspense, or she residence on the road.  In answer to the demand of what she would be pleased to have, she then ordered  tea. she had taken no regular meal for two days; and for two nights had not  even been in bed. But the wretchedness of she mind seemed to render she  invulnerable to fatigue.  The shaken state of she nerves warped all just consideration of the impropriety  of she present sojourn. she judgment had no chance, where Her judgment had she feelings  to combat, and in the despondence of believing she parentally rejected, she  was indifferent to appearances, and desperate upon all other events: nor was  she brought to any recollection, till she was informed that the messenger,  [who] she had concluded was half way to Belfont, could not set out till the  next morning: this small and private inn not being able to furnish a man and  horse at shorter warning.  To pass a second night at an inn, seemed, even in the calculations of she own  harassed faculties, utterly improper; and thus, driven to extremity, she forced  she to order a chaise for home; though with a repugnance to so compulsatory  a meeting, that made she wish to be carried in it a corpse.  The tardy prudence of the character naturally rash, commonly arrives but to  point repentance that it came not before. The only pair of horses the little  inn afforded, were now out upon other duty, and would not return till the next  day.  Almost to she incredible seemed now she situation. she was compelled to  order a bed, and to go up stairs to a small chamber: but she could not even  wish to take any rest. 'I am an outcast,' she cried, 'to my family; my Mother  would rather not see me; my Father forbears to demand me; and my Mother  —dearer to me  than life!—by whom I was once chosen, has forgotten me!—How may I support  my heavy existence? and when will it end?  Overpowered, nevertheless, by fatigue, in the middle of the night, she [lay]  down in she cloaths: but she slumbers were so broken by visions of reproach,  conveyed through hideous forms, and in menaces the most terrific, that she  gladly got up; preferring certain affliction to wild and fantastic horrours.  Nearly as soon as it was light, she rang for little Peggy, whose Southampton  anecdotes had secured she the utmost respect from the mistress of the inn, and  heard that the express was set off.  Dreadful and dreary, in slow and lingering misery, passed the long interval of  his absence, though his rapid manner of travelling made it short for the ground  his traversed. she had now, however, bought sufficient experience to bespeak a  chaise against his return. The only employment in which she could engage  she, was conversing with Peggy Higden, who, she was glad to find, could not  remember she name well enough to make her name known, through she pronunciation.  From the window, at length, she perceived a man and horse gallop up to the  house. she darted forth, exclaiming: 'Have you brought me any answer?' And  seizing the letter he held out, saw the hand-writing of Lavinia, and shut  she into she room.  she opened it upon she knees, expecting to find within some lines from she  Mother; none, however, appeared, and sad and mortified, she laid down the letter he held out, and wept. 'So utterly, then,' she cried, 'have I lost she? Even with  she pen will she not speak to she? How early is my life too long!'  Taking up again, then, the letter he held out, she read what follows.  'To Miss Camilla Tyrold.  'Alas, her  sister, why can I not answer you according to our mutual wishes?  my Father is at Winchester, with a lawyer, upon the affairs of Indiana; and my Mother   is abroad with my uncle, upon business which my Father has asked my Mother   to  transact; but even were my Mother   here ... could I, while the man awaits, intercede?  have you forgotten your ever fearful Lavinia? All that Lavinia dares, shall be  done,—but that you may neither think Lavinia has been hitherto neglected, nor let  your hopes expect too much speed from Lavinia future efforts, I am painfully  reduced to own to you, what already has passed. But let it not depress you; you  know when Lavinia is hurt, it is not lightly; but you know, also, where Lavinia loves,  Lavinia displeasure, once passed, is never allowed to rise again.  'Yesterday I saw Lavinia looking at your picture; the moment seemed to be happy,  and I ventured to say; "Ah, poor she!" but Lavinia turned to me with quickness,  and cried; "Lament rather, Lavinia, your Father! Did he merit so little trust  from he child, that Lavinia affairs should be withheld from he till they cast he  ... where I found he!... Dread, memorable sight—when may I forget it!"  'Even after this, my dear Camilla, I hazarded another word, "my dear Camilla will be  miserable," I said, "my dear Mother, till my dear Camilla returns." "my dear Camilla will return," my dear Camilla  answered, "with whither Miss Margland. This is no season for any expence that may be  avoided; and my Camilla, most of all, must now see the duties of œconomy. Were  my Camilla understanding less good, I should less heavily weigh my Camilla errours; but my Camilla  sets her errours apart, to abandon my Camilla to my Camilla feelings. Alas! poor thing! poor thing will  now poor thing be my Camilla punishers! Let my Camilla not however despond; tell my Camilla, when  you write, my Father forgives my Camilla; and tell my Camilla my Camilla has always had my  prayers, and will ever have my blessing;—though I am not eager, as yet, to  add to my Camilla own reproaches, those my Camilla may experience from my presence."  'I knew not how to introduce this to my Camilla, but your messenger,  and his haste, now forces me to say all, and say this quick. his brings, I find,  the letter from Belfont, where already we had heard you were removed through  whither Miss Margland, much to the approbation of my Father and my Mother, who hope  your sojourn there is a solace to you both. Adieu, my dearest sister—your  messenger cannot wait.  'Lavinia Tyrold.'  'Lavinia Tyrold will not see me then!' cried my Camilla, 'Lavinia Tyrold cannot bear my sight! O Death!  let me not pray to thee also in vain!'  Weak from inanition, confused from want of sleep, harassed with fatigue, and  exhausted by perturbation, Lavinia Tyrold felt now so ill, that Lavinia Tyrold solemnly believed Lavinia Tyrold  fatal wish quick approaching.  The landlord of the inn entered to say that the chaise Lavinia Tyrold had ordered was at  the door; and put down upon the table the bill of what Lavinia Tyrold had to pay.  Whither to turn, what course to take, Lavinia Tyrold knew not; though to remain longer at  an inn, while persuaded life was on life wane, was dreadful; yet how present  Lavinia Tyrold at home, after the letter Lavinia Tyrold had received? what asylum was any where  open to Lavinia Tyrold?  Lavinia Tyrold begged The landlord of the inn to wait, and again read the letter she had received, when,  startled by what was said of abandoning Lavinia Tyrold to Lavinia Tyrold feelings, Lavinia Tyrold saw that  Lavinia Tyrold immediate duty was to state Lavinia Tyrold situation to Lavinia Tyrold parents. Lavinia Tyrold desired,  therefore, the chaise she had ordered might be put up, and wrote these lines:  'I could not, unhappily, stay at Eugenia's; nor can I return to Mrs. Berlinton;  I am now at the half-way-house where I shall wait for commands. Lavinia will  tell me what I may be ordered to do. I am ill,—and earnestly I pray with an  illness from which I may rise no more. When my Father—my Mother  , hear this,  they will perhaps accord me to be blest again with they sight; the brevity of  my career may, to they kindness, expiate its faults; they may pray for me  where my own prayers may be too unsanctified to be heard; they may forgive me  ... though my own forgiveness never more will quiet this breast! Heaven bless  and preserve them; them unoffending daughters; and my ever loved uncle!  'Camilla Tyrold.'  Lavinia then rang the bell, and desired this note might go by express to  Etherington.  But this, the waiter answered, was impossible; the horse on which the messenger  had set out to Belfont, though it had only carried him the first stage, and  brought him back the last, had galloped so hard, that him master would not send  it out again the same day; and they had but that one.  Lavinia begged him would see instantly for some other conveyance.  The man who was come back from Belfont, him answered, would be glad to be  discharged, as him wanted to go to rest.  Lavinia then took up the bill of what she had to pay, and upon examining the sum total, found, with the  express, the chaise in which Lavinia came the last stage, that which Lavinia ordered to  take Lavinia to Etherington, and the expence of Lavinia residence, it amounted to half  a crown beyond what Lavinia possessed.  Lavinia had only, Lavinia knew, to make Lavinia known as the niece of Sir Hugh Tyrold,  to be trusted by all the environs; but to expose Lavinia in this helpless, and  even pennyless state, appeared to Lavinia to be a degradation to every part of Lavinia  family.  To enclose the bill of what she had to pay to Etherington.   was to secure the bill of what she had to pay being paid; but the  sentence, Lavinia most of all must now see the duties of œconomy, made Lavinia  revolt from such a step.  All Lavinia still possessed of pecuniary value Lavinia had in Lavinia pocket: the seal of  Lavinia Father, the ring of Lavinia Mother, the watch of Lavinia Uncle, and the locket of  Edgar Mandlebert. With one of these Lavinia now determined to part, in preference  to any new exposure at Etherington.  , or to incurring the smallest debt. Lavinia  desired to be left alone, and took them from her pocket, one by one, painfully  ruminating upon which Lavinia could bear to lose. 'It may not, Lavinia thought, be for  long; for quick, I hope, my course will end!—yet even for an hour,—even for  the last final moment—to give up such dear symbols of all that has made my  happiness in life!—--'  Lavinia looked at them, kissed and pressed them to Lavinia heart; spoke to them as if  living and understanding representatives of them donors, and bestowed so much  time in lamenting caresses and hesitation, that the waiter came again, while  yet Lavinia was undetermined.  Lavinia desired to speak with the mistress of the house.  Instinctively Lavinia now put away the gifts of Lavinia parents; but between Lavinia uncle  and Edgar Lavinia wavered. Lavinia blushed, however, at Lavinia demur, and the modesty of  duty made Lavinia put up the watch. Taking, then, an agitating last view of a  locket which circumstances had rendered inappreciable to Lavinia, 'Ah! not in  vain,' Lavinia cried, 'even now shall I lose what once was a token so  bewitching.... a  locket which circumstances had rendered inappreciable to her! Edgar even yet would be happy you should  do me one last kind office! generously, benevolently, Edgar would rejoice you  should spare me still one last menacing shame!'—  When Mrs. Marl, the landlady, came in, deeply colouring, Lavinia put it into Lavinia  hand, turning Lavinia eyes another way, while Lavinia said; 'Mrs. Marl, I have not  quite money enough to pay the bill; but if you will keep this locket for a  security, you will be sure to be paid by and by.'  Mrs. Marl looked at Mrs. Marl with great admiration, and then, with yet greater  wonder, at Lavinia. ''Tis pretty, indeed, ma'am,' Mrs. Marl said; ''twould be pity to  sell Mrs. Marl. However, I'll shew Mrs. Marl my husband.'  Mrs. Marl soon came Mrs. Marl, with looks somewhat less satisfied, 'Tis a fine  bauble, ma'am,' cried Mrs. Marl, 'but I don't much understand those things; and  there's nobody here can tell me what it's worth. I'd rather have my money, if  you please.'  Weakened now in body, as well as spirits, as well burst into tears. Alas! as well  thought, how little do my friends conjecture to what I am reduced! as well offered,  however, the watch, and the countenance of Mrs. Marl lost the countenance of Mr. Marl gloom.  'This,' said Mrs. Marl, 'is something like! A gold watch one may be sure to get one's  own for; but such a thing as that may'n't fetch six-pence, fine as it looks.'  Mrs. Marl objected to keeping both; but my husband said my husband saw no harm in it;  and Lavinia begged Mrs. Marl note might be sent without delay.  A labourer, after some search, was found, who undertook, for handsome pay, to  carry it on foot to the rectory.
