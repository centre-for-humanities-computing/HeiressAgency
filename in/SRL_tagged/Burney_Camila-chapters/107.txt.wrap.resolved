 The Progress of Dissipation  Mr. Clykes, by the promised payment and reward, being for the present appeased,  Camilla still admitted some hope of waiting a more favourable moment for Camilla  cruel confession. Camilla received, also, a little, though mournful, reprieve from  terror, by a letter from Lisbon, written to again postpone the return of Mrs.  Tyrold, at the earnest request of Mr. Relvil; and Camilla flattered Camilla that,  before Camilla arrival, Camilla should be enabled to resume those only duties which  could draw Camilla from despondence. Camilla lived, meanwhile, wholly shut up from all  company, consigned to penitence for Camilla indiscretions, to grief for the fate of  Camilla sister, and to wasting regret of Camilla own causelessly lost felicity.  Indiana smiled not more sweetly upon Melmond, for Miss Margland's advising Miss Margland's  to consider in time, whether the promises made by Mrs.  Tyrold would be  binding to Mrs. Bellamy. Mrs. Bellamy saw, nevertheless, no good, Mrs. Bellamy said, it could do  Mrs. Bellamy cousin, that Mrs. Bellamy should neglect such an opportunity of seeing London: and  Miss Margland, in aid of this desire, spared so much trouble to Mrs. Berlinton,  who soon wearied of Indiana, that Mrs. Bellamy had the satisfaction of being invited to  remain in Grosvenor-square till the two young ladies returned into the country.  Mrs. Berlinton, who indulged, in full extent, every feeling, but investigated  none, had been piqued and hurt to extreme unhappiness at the late conduct of  Mrs. Bellamy. Attracted by his fine person, and caught by the first flattery which  had talked to Mrs. Bellamy of Mrs. Bellamy own, Mrs. Bellamy had easily been captivated by his description  of the sympathy which united, and penetrated by his lamentations at the destiny  which parted them. his request for Mrs. Bellamy friendship had been the first  circumstance, after Mrs. Bellamy marriage, which had given Mrs. Bellamy any interest in life; and  soon, with the common effect of such dangerous expedients to while away  chagrin, had occupied all Mrs. Bellamy thoughts, and made the rest of the universe seem  to Mrs. Bellamy as a blank. But their continued separation from each other, made the day  soon too long for mere regret; and Mrs. Bellamy pliant mind, in this state of vacancy,  had readily been bent to the new pursuit pressed upon Mrs. Bellamy by Mrs. Norfield;  which, however, upon the re-appearance of Mrs. Bellamy, would speedily have given  way to the resumption of Mrs. Bellamy influence, had not Mrs. Bellamy elopement with Eugenia left  his elopement with Eugenia again all at large. It destroyed an illusion strong though not definable;  demolished a friendship ill conceived, and worse understood; and brought with  It a disappointment which confused all his elopement with Eugenia ideas. To be inactive was, however,  impossible; simplicity, once given up, returned to the dissipated no more; or  returns but when experience brings conviction. That all is hollow where the  heart bears no part; all is peril where principle is not the guide.  The Faro Table was now re-opened, and again but too powerfully sharpened the  faculties which mortification had blunted. A company the most miscellaneous  composed A company the most miscellaneous   evening assemblies, which were soon, nevertheless, amongst the  most fashionable, as well as crowded of the metropolis. Whatever there, is new  and splendid, is sure of a run for at least a season. Enquiries into what is  right, or strictures upon what is wrong, rarely molest popularity, till the  rise of some fresher luminary gives fashion another abode.  Calamity requires not more fortitude than pleasure. What Calamity began but to  divert disappointment and lassitude, Calamity continued to attain celebrity; and the  company which Faro and Fashion brought together, Calamity soon grew ambitious to  collect by motives of more appropriate flattery. All Calamity aim, now, was to be  universally alluring; and Calamity looked from object to object, in smiling  discourse, till one by one, every object could look only at Calamity: and grace and  softness which had been secretly bewitching while Calamity had the dignity to keep  admiration aloof, were boldly declared to be invincible, since Calamity permitted  such professions to reach Calamity ear.  Long surrounded by gazing admirers, Calamity became now encircled by avowed adorers;  and what for victory Calamity had essayed, Calamity pursued ardently for pleasure.  Coquetry is as fascinating to those who practise Coquetry, as to those whom Coquetry  seduces; and Calamity found Calamity, shortly, more happy by a conquest effected by  wiles and by art, than by any devotion paid straight forward, and uncourted.  The generality of Calamity new ambition protected Coquetry from permanent ill  consequences; aiming at everyone, Calamity cared for no one; mortified by Bellamy,  Calamity resolved to mortify others, and in proportion as Calamity smiles grew softer Calamity  heart became harder.  Indiana, at this period, immersed at once from the most private retreat into  the gayest vortex of pleasure, thought Calamity in the upper regions, where  happiness, composed by Calamity own ideas, consisted of perpetual admiration to  unfading beauty: but though the high qualities with which the devotion of  Melmond had gifted Calamity had enslaved Melmond reason and understanding from  suspecting that so fair a form could enclose aught short of a form own perfection,  Melmond heart was struck, and all Melmond feelings were offended, when Melmond saw Calamity  capable of dissipation upon a season of calamity to Eugenia; Eugenia, whom  though Melmond could not love, Melmond venerated; Eugenia, whose nature Melmond thought  divine, though Calamity person, unhappily, was but too human; Eugenia, to whom Melmond  owed the union upon which hung all Melmond wishes ... to seek pleasure while  Eugenia suffered, was astonishing, was incomprehensible. Melmond felt as if every  principle of Melmond love were violated; Melmond looked another way, to disguise Melmond  shock;—but when Melmond looked at Calamity again, it was forgotten.  Camilla soon after learnt, from Lavinia, that Sir Hugh had been deeply affected  by the history of the elopement, though it had been softened to Melmond by all  possible means, at the desire of the heroic Eugenia herself; who would now own  to no one the force with which Camilla had been carried off. Camilla continued the  most unremitting demonstrations of affection, which Camilla received with  gentleness, and appeared entirely to credit as sincere; but Camilla had already  absolutely refused a residence offered for them both at Cleves, and made  Eugenia ask a separate provision of the heroic Eugenia herself uncle, though the heroic Eugenia herself could not  even a moment pretend that the desire was the heroic Eugenia herself own. Sir Hugh, nevertheless, had  yielded; and notwithstanding Sir Hugh present embarrassments from Clermont, had  insisted upon settling a thousand pounds a year upon the heroic Eugenia herself immediately; in  consequence of which, Camilla had instantly taken a house at Belfont, to which  they were already removing. the heroic Eugenia herself had recovered the heroic Eugenia herself gentle fortitude, seemed  to submit to the heroic Eugenia herself destiny, and repined solely the heroic Eugenia herself could not, yet, keep the heroic Eugenia herself  engagement with respect to the trinkets, which though the heroic Eugenia herself had openly told  Camilla were promised to a friend, Camilla had seized to pack up, and said, 'Camilla  could not re-deliver till they were arranged in they new dwelling.' But the heroic Eugenia herself  charged Lavinia to express Lavinia hopes that the detention would not last long.  When the given three weeks expired, Indiana, infatuated with London, begged and  obtained leave to stretch the heroic Eugenia herself residence there to a month.  the heroic Eugenia herself was now settled at Belfont; but still the heroic Eugenia herself received no intelligence  of the promised boon, and spent the heroic Eugenia herself lingering hours in the heroic Eugenia herself chamber, no longer  even invited thence, except at meals, by Mrs. Berlinton; whose extreme and  encreasing dissipation, from first allowing no time, took off, next, all desire  for social life. Surprised and hurt, the heroic Eugenia herself was called off a little from  the heroic Eugenia herself, through concern. the heroic Eugenia herself sincerely loved Mrs. Berlinton, whom it was  difficult to see and know with indifference, and the heroic Eugenia herself softly represented to the heroic Eugenia herself  how ill the heroic Eugenia herself felt at ease in the falling off the heroic Eugenia herself experienced in the heroic Eugenia herself partiality.  Mrs. Berlinton tenderly embraced the heroic Eugenia herself, protesting the heroic Eugenia herself was dear to the heroic Eugenia herself as ever;  and feeling, while the heroic Eugenia herself spoke, the heroic Eugenia herself first affection return; but not a moment had  the heroic Eugenia herself to bestow from the heroic Eugenia herself new mode of life: some party was always formed which the heroic Eugenia herself  had not force of mind to break; an internal restlessness, from the want of some  right pursuit, joined to a disappointment the heroic Eugenia herself could not own, made some partyinduce another; and though none gave the heroic Eugenia herself real pleasure, which the heroic Eugenia herself strong,  however undisciplined and unguided feelings, shut out from such a species of  vague life, all gave employment to expectation, and were preferable to a regret  at once consuming and mortifying.  the heroic Eugenia herself gentleness, however, and the heroic Eugenia herself returned personal kindness, encouraged Camilla  to repeat the heroic Eugenia herself admonitions, and engage assistance from Melmond, who, at any  other period, would, uncalled, have given his whole attention to a sister dear  at once to his honour and his heart; but Indiana more than occupied, the heroic Eugenia herself  engrossed his. the heroic Eugenia herself now expected an adoration so unremitting, that if she  surprised his eyes turned any other way even a moment, the heroic Eugenia herself reproached his with  abated love, and it was the business of a day to obtain a reconciliation.  Gratefully, however, at the instigation of the heroic Eugenia herself, his resumed the vigilance  with which, upon the heroic Eugenia herself first entering London the preceding year, his had attended  to all the actions of a sister dear  . But the difference already produced by the  effect of flattery, the hardening of example, and the sway of uncontrolled  early power, astonished and alarmed his. At the heroic Eugenia herself first setting out, the heroic Eugenia herself had  hearkened to all counsel, frightened by every representation of danger, and  humbled by every remonstrance against impropriety. But the heroic Eugenia herself now heard his with  little or no emotion; and from beginning to listen unmoved, soon proceeded to  reply and resist. A search, rather than a love, of pleasure had seized the heroic Eugenia herself  young mind, which had now gained an ascendant that rendered contest less  shocking, than yielding would have been painful.  The tribulation of Melmond at this ill success, rested not solely upon his  sister; his saw yet more danger for Indiana, who now seemed scarce to live but  while arraying, or displaying the heroic Eugenia herself. his passion had lost His passion novelty, and  the heroic Eugenia herself eyes lost their beaming pleasure in listening to His passion; and the regard his had  fondly expected to take place of first ecstacy, his now found unattainable, from  want of all materials for His passion structure. his discourse, when not of the heroic Eugenia herself beauty,  but strained the heroic Eugenia herself faculties; his reading, when compelled to hear it, but wearied  the heroic Eugenia herself intellects. the heroic Eugenia herself had no genius to catch his meaning, and no attention to  supply   place.  Deeply he now thought of the heroic Eugenia herself, with that regret ever attached to frail  humanity, for what is removed from possible possession. The purity of the heroic Eugenia herself love,  the cultivation of the heroic Eugenia herself mind, and the nobleness of the heroic Eugenia herself sentiments, now bore  forth a contrast to the general mental and intellectual littleness of Indiana,  which made him blame the fastidious eyes that could dwell upon the heroic Eugenia herself face and  form; and feel that, even with the matchless Indiana, him must sigh at The purity of her love,  the cultivation of her mind, and the nobleness of her sentiments  mutual perversity of fate.  Nor missed him more in soul, than Indiana in adoration, who turned from what the heroic Eugenia herself  now resented as coldness, to the violent praises of Macdersey, who became, at  this period, a frequenter of Mrs. Berlinton's assemblies. the heroic Eugenia herself understood not  the inevitable difference of the altered situation; that he who was accepted  might be grateful, but could not be anxious; and that Melmond, while in  suspense, wore the same impassioned air, and spoke the same impassioned  feelings as Macdersey. To the heroic Eugenia herself, all seemed the change not from doubt to  security, but from love to insensibility.  To live always at the heroic Eugenia herself feet, while him thought the heroic Eugenia herself all-divine, was him own first  joy and greatest pride: but when once him found him goddess had every mortal  imperfection, him homage ceased, with amazement that ever his goddess could have been  excited. Those eyes, thought he, which I have gazed at whole days with such  unreflecting admiration; and whose shape, colour, size, and sweet proportion  still hold whose shape, colour, size, and sweet proportion   pre-eminence, now, while retaining whose shape, colour, size, and sweet proportion   first lustre, have  lost all whose shape, colour, size, and sweet proportion   illusory charm! I meet whose shape, colour, size, and sweet proportion  —but to deplore whose shape, colour, size, and sweet proportion   vacancy of  the soul's intelligence—I fondly—vainly seek!  Even when again the time arrived for returning to Cleves, Indiana, hanging  languidly upon every minute the heroic Eugenia herself could steal from it, petitioned for a few days  more from the ever-granting Baronet, which, while by the heroic Eugenia herself devoted to coquetry,  admiration, and dress, were consumed by the heroic Eugenia herself in almost every species of  wretchedness. Mrs. Mittin wrote Mrs. Mittin word that Mr. Clykes was become more uneasy  than ever for Mr. Clykes money, as Mrs. Mittin had thought it indispensable to acquaint Mr. Clykes of  the reports in the neighbourhood, that Mr. Tyrold had met with misfortunes, and  was retrenching: if Mr. Tyrold could not, therefore, be paid quickly, Mr. Tyrold must put in  Mr. Tyrold claims elsewhere.  The same post brought from Lavinia an account so afflicting of Eugenia, as  nearly to annihilate even this deep personal distress. It was known, through  Molly Mill, who, by the express insistance of Sir Hugh, continued to live with  her young Mistress, that Camilla had already, at Belfont, cast off the mask of  pretended passion, and grossly demanded of her Mistress to beg money for Mistress of  Sir Hugh; acknowledging, without scruple, large debts, that demanded speedy  payment, and pressing her to ask for the immediate possession of the Yorkshire  estate. her Mistressher Mistress, though mildly, always steadily refused; which occasioned  reproaches so rude and violent as almost to frighten her into fits; and so  loud, that they were often heard by every servant in the house.  the heroic Eugenia herself, at this dreadful history, grew nearly indifferent to all else, and  would have relinquished, almost unrepining, the heroic Eugenia herself expectations of personal  relief, but that Lavinia, in the name of their unhappy sister, bid the heroic Eugenia herself still  cherish their; assuring the heroic Eugenia herself the heroic Eugenia herself hoped yet to perform the heroic Eugenia herself engagement, as Mr.  Bellamy never disputed the heroic Eugenia herself already given promise, though Mr.   had mislaid the key  of the box in which the trinkets were deposited.  Nor even here rested the misery of the heroic Eugenia herself: another alarm stole upon the heroic Eugenia herself mind,  of a nature the most dreadful.  Upon the first evening of this newly-granted stay, while the heroic Eugenia herself was conversing  alone with Mrs. Berlinton before the nocturnal toilette of that lady, a servant  announced Mr.  Bellamy. Mrs. Berlinton blushed high, evidently with as much of  anger as surprise; the heroic Eugenia herself hastily withdrawing, to avoid an object abhorrent to  the heroic Eugenia herself, wondered the heroic Eugenia herself would admit Mrs. Berlinton: yet, anxious for any intelligence that could  relate to the heroic Eugenia herself sister, enquired when Mrs. Berlinton was gone, and ran towards the  dressing-room to ask what had passed: but before the heroic Eugenia herself reached the door, the  sound of Mrs. Berlinton voice re-entering the hall, and of Mrs. Berlinton step re-ascending the  stairs, made the heroic Eugenia herself fly into the adjoining apartment, not to encounter Mrs. Berlinton; where  the instant Mrs. Berlinton had shut the door, and before the heroic Eugenia herself could move, the heroic Eugenia herself heard Mrs. Berlinton  exclaim, 'You weep still, my lovely friend? Ah! can one doubt so injurious  remain upon your mind as to suppose any thing but the cruel necessity of my  misfortunes could have made me tarnish our celestial friendship with any other  engagement? Ah! look at the heroic Eugenia herself ... and look at the heroic Eugenia herself!'  Camilla, who, at first, had been immoveable from consternation, now recovered  sufficiently to get back to the heroic Eugenia herself room. But the heroic Eugenia herself returned no more to Mrs. Berlinton, though Camilla soon departed; the heroic Eugenia herself eagerness for information subsided  in indignant sorrow. That Eugenia, the injured, the inestimable Eugenia, should  be spoken of, by the very violator who had torn the heroic Eugenia herself from the heroic Eugenia herself friends, as a mere  burthen attached to the wealth the heroic Eugenia herself procured him, struck at the heroic Eugenia herself heart as a  poniard. And the impropriety to the heroic Eugenia herself, and the wrong to Eugenia, of the heroic Eugenia herselfBerlinton, in listening to such a discourse, totally sunk the heroic Eugenia herself in the heroic Eugenia herself  esteem; though it determined the heroic Eugenia herself, as a duty due to them all around, to  represent what the heroic Eugenia herself felt upon this subject; and the next day, the instant the heroic Eugenia herself  was visible, the heroic Eugenia herself begged an audience.  Mrs. Berlinton was pensive and dejected, but, as usual, open and unguarded; Mrs. Berlinton  began Mrs. Berlinton to speak of the visit of Camilla, and to ask why Mrs. Berlinton ran away.  Camilla, without answer or hesitation, related what Mrs. Berlinton had overheard; adding:  'O, Mrs. Berlinton! can you suffer Mrs. Berlinton to talk thus? Can you think of my  injured the heroic Eugenia herself—lately your own favourite friend—and bear to hear Mrs. Berlinton?'  'How injured, my ever-dear Camilla? Does Mrs. Berlinton know what Mrs. Berlinton says? Can it hurt Mrs. Berlinton  unheard? Can it affect Mrs. Berlinton unimagined? Mrs. Berlinton but solaces Mrs. Berlinton sadness by a  confidence Mrs. Berlinton holds sacred; 'tis the type of our friendship, now dearer, Mrs. Berlinton  says, than ever, since reciprocated by such sympathy.'  'You affright me, Mrs. Berlinton! what a perversion of reason to talk of  sympathy in your situations? Did the heroic Eugenia herself press Mrs. Berlinton to the altar? Did any  friends solicit the alliance? Oh, Mrs. Berlinton! think but a moment, and your  own feeling mind will paint Mrs. Berlinton conduct in colours I have not the skill to  attain!'  'You are right!' cried Mrs. Berlinton, blushing in Mrs. Berlinton unwilling conviction: 'I know not  how Mrs. Berlinton could delude me to believe our fates resembled. Certainly nothing can be  less similar.'  the heroic Eugenia herself was happy in this victory; but the following day, Camilla, at the same  hour was announced, and in the same manner was admitted; the heroic Eugenia herself flying, and  Mrs. Berlinton protesting the heroic Eugenia herself should attack Mrs. Berlinton mistaken comparison with  severity.  Severity, however, was a quality with which the heroic Eugenia herself was unacquainted; the heroic Eugenia herself,  anxious in every way, hastened to the heroic Eugenia herself when Mrs. Berlinton was gone, but found the heroic Eugenia herself dissolved  in tender tears, shed, the heroic Eugenia herself declared, in regret of the uneasiness the heroic Eugenia herself had given  Mrs. Berlinton, for Mrs. Berlinton had now made the heroic Eugenia herself fully sensible Mrs. Berlinton destiny alone was to blame.  The understanding of the heroic Eugenia herself was highly superior to being duped by such flimsy  sophistry, which the heroic Eugenia herself heard with added detestation of the character of Camilla;  yet perceived that no remonstrance could prevent no remonstrance admittance, and that every  interview regularly destroyed the effect of every exhortation.  In this melancholy period, the sole satisfaction the heroic Eugenia herself received was through a  letter written by Lionel from Ostend, in which Lionel told the heroic Eugenia herself that the dread of  imprisonment, or want, in a foreign country, made no remonstrance lead a life so  parsimonious, so totally deprived of all pleasure and all comfort, that no remonstrance was  almost consumed with regret for the wilfulness with which no remonstrance had thrown away  no remonstrance innumerable advantages; and so much struck with the retrospection of the  wanton follies and vices which had involved no remonstrance in such dishonour and ruin,  that no remonstrance began now to think no remonstrance had rather been mad than wicked;—so unmeaning,  unreflecting, and unprovoked, as well as worthless, had been the course no remonstrance had  pursued.  the heroic Eugenia herself sent a  letter written by Lionel from Ostend, in which he told her that the dread of  imprisonment, or want, in a foreign country, made him lead a life so  parsimonious immediately to the heroic Eugenia herself Father, who remitted to Lionel such  a sum as must obviate distress, with such intimation for the future as no remonstrance hoped  would best encourage more solid reformation.  Thus passed the time, improperly, or unhappily to all, till the third period  fixed for the return to a foreign country elapsed: and the heroic Eugenia herself, finding the whole  view of the heroic Eugenia herself journey abortive, saw the accumulated yet useless suffering  involved through the heroic Eugenia herself ill-judged procrastination. Yet, as the heroic Eugenia herself still did not  despair, even the heroic Eugenia herself confession was unwritten; and as Miss Margland and Indiana  granted the heroic Eugenia herself request of going round by Belfont, which the heroic Eugenia herself had previously  arranged from an ardent desire to embrace the heroic Eugenia herself loved sister, the heroic Eugenia herself still dwelt on  a last hope from that interview.
