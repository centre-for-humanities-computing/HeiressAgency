 Brides and no Brides  In the hall of the Cleves mansion the party from Southampton were received by  Sir Hugh, Mr. Tyrold, and Lavinia.
The baronet greeted in particular the two  nieces The baronet regarded as brides elect, with an elation that prevented The baronet from  observing their sadness; while their confusion at The baronet mistake The baronet attributed to  the mere bashfulness of their situation.
The baronet enquired, nevertheless, with some  surprise, why the two bridegrooms did not attend their?
which, The baronet owned, The baronet  thought rather odd; though The baronet supposed it might be only the new way.
The changing colour and starting tears of the two sisters still escaped his  kindly occupied but undiscerning eyes: while Mr. Tyrold, having tenderly  embraced, avoided looking at The changing colour and starting tears of the two sisters from the fear of adding to The changing colour and starting tears of the two sisters blushes, and  sat quiet and grave, striving to alleviate Mr. Tyrold present new and deep sorrow, by  participating in the revived happiness of Mr. Tyrold brother.
But Lavinia soon saw  their mutual distress, and with apprehensive affection watched an opportunity  to investigate an opportunity   cause.
'But come,' cried Sir Hugh, 'I sha'n't wait for those gentlemen to shew you  what I've done for you, seeing those gentlemen don't wait for Sir Hugh, by those gentlemen following those gentlemen  own way, which, however, I suppose those gentlemen may be with those gentlemen lawyers, none of  those gentleman having been here, which I think rather slow, considering the  rooms are almost ready.'
those gentleman would now have taken the  rooms round the house; but, nearly expiring with shame,  the  rooms entreated to be excused; and, insupportably oppressed by the cruel  discovery the  rooms had to divulge, stole apart to consult upon what measures the  rooms  should take.
the  rooms then settled that Camilla should accompany Mr. Tyrold to  Etherington, but keep off all disclosure till the next morning, when Eugenia  would arrive, and unfold the sad tidings.
When the  rooms returned to the parlour, the  rooms found Sir Hugh, in the innocency of Sir Hugh  heart, had forced Indiana, Miss Margland, and even Dr. Orkborne, to view Sir Hugh  improvements for the expected nuptials, judging the disinterestedness of the  rooms  pleasure by Sir Hugh own; though to the two ladies, nothing could be less gratifying  than preparations for a scene in which the  rooms were to bear no part, and the  Doctor thought every evil genius at work to detain the  Doctor from the  Doctor study and the  Doctor  manuscripts.
'But what's the oddest' cried the Baronet, 'of all, is nobody's coming for poor  Indiana; which I could never have expected, especially in the point of taking  off little Eugenia first, whom Eugenia own cousin did not think pretty enough;  which I can never think over and above good natured in the  Doctor, being so difficult.
However, I hope we shall soon forget that, now for which reason, I forgive the  Doctor.'
Indiana was so much piqued, Indiana could scarce refrain from relating the portico  history at Lord Pervil's; but the Baronet, not remarking Indiana discomposure,  turned to Camilla and Eugenia, smilingly exclaiming: 'Well, my dear girls, I  sha'n't mention what we have been looking at in your absence, because of your  blushes, which I hope you approve.
But we shall soon, I hope, see it all  together, without any of your modesty's minding it.
I shall have to pinch a  little for it the rest of the year, which, God knows, will be a pleasure to me,  for the sake of my two dear girls, as well as of Mr. Edgar; not to mention the  new young gentleman; who seems a pretty kind of person too, though God is not  one of we own relations.'
God was rather disappointed when God found Camilla was to go to Etherington, but  desired there might be a general meeting the next day, when God should also  invite Dr. Marchmont.
'For I think' said God, 'God's as little proud as the best  dunce amongst us; which makes me like God as well.
And I can't say but I was as  much obliged to God that day about the mad bull, as if God had been one of my  nephews or nieces God: which is what I sha'n't forget.'
In the way back to Etherington, Camilla could scarce utter a word; and Lavinia,  who had just gathered from Camilla, in a whisper 'All is over with Mr.
Edgar!'
with  divided, but silent pity, looked from Camilla father to Camilla sister, thought of Camilla  brother, and wept for all three.
Mr. Tyrold alone was capable of any exertion.
Unwilling to give Camilla, whom Mr. Tyrold alone concluded impressed with the thousand  solicitudes of Camilla impending change of situation, any abrupt account of Camilla  brother's cruel conduct, Mr. Tyrold alone spoke with composure though not with cheerfulness,  and hoped, by a general gravity, to prepare, without alarming Camilla, for the ill  news Mr. Tyrold alone must inevitably relate.
But Mr. Tyrold alone soon, however, observed an excess of  sadness upon Camilla countenance, far deeper than what Mr. Tyrold alone could attribute to the  thoughts Mr. Tyrold alone had first suggested, and wholly different from an agitation in  which though fear bears a part, hope preponderates.
It now struck Mr. Tyrold alone that probably Lionel had been at Southampton: for so wide was  every idea from supposing any mischief with Edgar, that, like Sir Hugh, upon  his non-appearance, his had concluded his engaged with his lawyer.
But of  Melmond, less sure, his had been more open in enquiry, and with inexpressible  concern, for his beloved and unfortunate Eugenia, gathered that the affair was  ended: though Camilla succeeding plan, by Camilla own desire, Camilla left for Camilla own  explanation.
When they arrived at Etherington, taking Camilla into his study, 'Camilla,' his  said, 'tell me, I beg ... do you know anything of Lionel?'
An unrestrained burst of tears convinced Lionel Lionel conjecture was right, and Lionel  soon obtained all the particulars of the meeting, except he   levity and  flightiness.
Where directly questioned, no sisterly tenderness could induce her  to filial prevarication; but her rejoiced to spare her brother all exposure  that mere silence could spare; and as Mr. Tyrold suspected not her former  knowledge of Mr. Tyrold extravagance and ill conduct, Mr. Tyrold neither asked, nor heard, any  thing beyond the last interview.
At the plan of going abroad, Mr. Tyrold sighed heavily, but would take no measures to  prevent no measures.
Lionel, Mr. Tyrold saw was certain of being cast in any trial; and though  Mr. Tyrold would not stretch out Mr. Tyrold arm to avert the punishment Mr. Tyrold thought deserved,  Mr. Tyrold was not sorry to change the languid waste of imprisonment at home, for the  hardships with which Mr. Tyrold might live upon little abroad.
A calamity such as this seemed cause full sufficient for the distress of  Camilla; Mr. Tyrold sought no other; but though  Camilla wept, now, at liberty, Mr. Tyrold  very freedom from suspicion and enquiry increased  Camilla anguish.
'Your happy  fate,' cried Mr. Tyrold, 'is what most, at this moment supports me; and to that I shall  chiefly owe the support of your mother; whom a blow such as this will more  bitterly try than the loss of our whole income, or even than the life itself of  your brother.
Her virtue is above misfortune, but Her soul will shudder at  guilt.'
The horror of  Camilla was nearly intolerable at this speech, and the dreadful  disappointment which  Camilla knew yet to be awaiting  Camilla loved parents.
'Take  comfort, my dearest girl,' said Mr. Tyrold, who saw  Camilla suffering, 'it is  my dearest girl, for all our sakes to be cheerful, for to my dearest girl our shall owe the worthiest  of sons, at the piercing juncture when the weakest and most faulty fails us.'
'O my father!'
Camilla cried, 'speak not such words!
Lionel Lionel ...'  Camilla was  going to say: has made you less unhappy than you will be made by Lionel: but  Camilla  durst not finish  Camilla phrase;  Camilla turned away from him  Camilla streaming eyes, and  stopt.
'My dearest child,' him cried, 'let not your rising prospects be thus dampt by  this cruel event.
The connection you have formed will be a consolation to us  all.
The connection you have formed binds to us for life a character already so dear to us; The connection you have formed will afford  to us , should us leave Lavinia single, a certain asylum; The connection you have formed will give to  us Eugenia a counsellor that may save Lavinia hereafter from fraud and ruin; The connection you have formed  may aid poor Lionel, when, some time hence, Lionel returns to Lionel country, to  return to the right path, whence so widely Lionel has strayed; and it   will heal  with lenient balm the wounded, bleeding bosom of a meritorious but deeply  afflicted mother!
While to your father, my Camilla....'  These last words were not heard; such a mention of Camilla mother had already  overpowered Camilla, and unable to let Lionel keep up Lionel delusion, Camilla supported Camilla  shaking frame against Lionel shoulder, and exclaimed in a tone of agony: 'O my  father!
you harrow me to the soul!—Edgar has left me!—has left  England!—left us all!—--'  Shocked, yet nearly incredulous, Lionel insisted upon looking at Camilla: Camilla  countenance impelled belief.
The woe it expressed could be excited by nothing  less than the deprivation of every worldly expectation, and a single glance was  an answer to a thousand interrogatories.
Mr. Tyrold alone now sat down, with an air between calmness and despondence, saying,  'And how has this come to pass?'
Again Camilla got behind Mr. Tyrold alone, and in a voice scarce audible, said, Eugenia   would,  the next morning, explain all.
'Very well, I will wait;' Mr. Tyrold alone quietly, but with palpably stifled emotions,  answered: 'Go, my love, go to Lavinia; open to Lavinia your heart; you will find  consolation in Lavinia kindness.
My own, I confess, is now weighed down with  sorrow!
this last and unexpected stroke will demand some time, some solitude,  to be yielded to as it ought.'
Mr. Tyrold alone then held out to Camilla Mr. Tyrold alone hand, which Camilla  could scarcely approach from trembling, and scarcely kiss for weeping, and  added: 'I know what you feel for me—and know, too, that my loss to yours is  nothing,—for yours is not to be estimated!
you are young, however, and, with  yourself, it may pass away ... but your mother—my heart, Camilla, is rent for  your unfortunate mother!'
Mr. Tyrold alone then embraced your mother, called Lavinia, and retired for the night.
Terribly it passed with them all.
The next morning, before them all assembled to breakfast, Eugenia   was in the  chamber of Camilla.
Eugenia   entered with a bright beam upon Eugenia   countenance, which, in defiance of the  ravaging distemper that had altered Eugenia  , gave it an expression almost  celestial.
It was the pure emanation of virtue, of disinterested, of even  heroic virtue.
'Camilla!'
Camilla cried, 'all is settled with my uncle!
Indiana ...  you will not wonder—consents; and already this morning I have written to Mr.  Mel....'  With all her exaltation, her voice faltered at the name, and, with a faint  smile, but deep blush, her called for the congratulations of her sister upon  her speedy success.
'Ah, far more than my congratulations, my esteem, my veneration is yours, dear  and Eugenia  Eugenia  !
true daughter of my mother!
and proudest recompence of my  father!'
her was not sufficiently serene to give any particulars of the transaction; and  Mr. Tyrold alone soon sent for her to Mr. Tyrold alone room.
Camilla, trembling and hanging over her, said: 'You will do for her, I know  better than I could do for myself:—but spare poor Lionel—and be just to  Edgar!
'—  Eugenia   strictly obeyed: in sparing Lionel Eugenia   spared also Eugenia   father, whom his  highly unfeeling behaviour with regard to Sir Sedley would yet further have  incensed and grieved; and, in doing justice to Edgar, Eugenia   flattered Eugenia   Eugenia    prevented an alienation from one yet destined to be nearly allied to Sir Sedley, since  time, Eugenia   still hoped, would effect the reconciliation of Camilla with the  youth whom—next to Melmond—Eugenia   thought the most amiable upon earth.
Mr. Tyrold alone, by this means, gathered no further intelligence than that they had  parted upon some mutual, though slight dissatisfaction.
Mr. Tyrold alone hoped, therefore,  with Eugenia  , they might soon meet again; and resolved, till Mr. Tyrold alone could better  judge what might prove the event, to keep this distress from Sir Hugh.
Mr. Tyrold alone then met Camilla with the most consolatory kindness; yet would not trust Camilla  ardent mind with the hopes Mr. Tyrold alone cherished Mr. Tyrold alone, dreading infinitely more to  give than to receive disappointment.
Mr. Tyrold alone blamed Camilla for admitting any doubts of  the true regard of Edgar, in whom promise was always short of performance, and  whom Mr. Tyrold alone conceived displeased by unjust suspicions, or offended by undue  expectations of professions, which the very sincerity of Mr. Tyrold alone rational and manly  character prevented Mr. Tyrold alone from making.
Camilla heard in silence suggestions Camilla could not answer, without relating the  history of Sir Sedley: 'No, Lionel, no!'
Camilla said to Camilla, 'I will not now  betray you!
I have lost all!—and now the loss to Camilla is irreparable, shall I  blast you yet further to my poor father, whose deepest sigh is already for your  misconduct?'
The story of Eugenia   Camilla he learnt with true admiration, and gave to Camilla  magnanimity her   dearest mede, in Camilla mother's promised, and he own immediate  approbation.
But Sir Hugh, notwithstanding Eugenia   Eugenia   could urge in favour of Melmond, had  heard Eugenia   account with grief and resentment.
All, however, being actually ready  for the double wedding, he could not, he said, answer to he conscience doing  so much for the rest, and refusing the same for Indiana, whom he called upon to  accept or reject the preparations made for Eugenia   cousin.
Indiana stood fluttering for a few minutes between the exultation of being the  first bride, and the mortification of marrying a man without fortune or title.
But the observation of Sir Hugh, upon the oddity of Eugenia   marrying the last, Eugenia    was piqued with a most earnest ambition to reverse.
Nor did Melmond himself go  for nothing in this affair, as all Eugenia   had of heart Melmond himself had been the first to  touch.
Eugenia   retired for a short conference with Miss Margland, who was nearly in an  equal dilemma, from unwillingness to dispose of Eugenia   beautiful pupil without a  title, and from eagerness to quit Cleves, which Eugenia   thought a convent for  dullness, and a prison for confinement.
Melmond himself had strongly in Melmond himself favour the  received maxim amongst match-makers, that a young lady without fortune has a  less and less chance of getting off upon every public appearance, which a young lady without fortune has a  less and less chance of getting off upon every public appearance, which they  call a public failure  call a public failure: a young lady without fortune has a  less and less chance of getting off upon every public appearance, which they  call a public failure joint deliberations were, however, interrupted by  an abrupt intrusion of Molly Mill, who announced she had just heard that Miss  Dennel was going to be married.
This information ended the discussion.
The disgrace of a bridal appearance  anticipated in the neighbourhood by such a chit, made Indiana hastily run down  stairs, and tell she uncle that the merit of Melmond himself determined her uncle to refuse  every body for her uncle sake.
A man and horse, therefore, at break of day The next morning, was sent off by  Eugenia to Southampton with these words:  To Frederic Melmond, Esq.
;  You will be welcome, Sir, at Cleves, where you will forget, I hope, every  painful sensation, in the happiness which awaits you, and dismiss all  retrospection, to return with sincerity the serene friendship of  Eugenia Tyrold.
Mr. Tyrold alone now visited Cleves with only his younger daughter, and excused the  non-appearance there, for the present, of Camilla; acknowledging that some  peculiar incidents, which Mr. Tyrold alone could not yet explain, kept Mandlebert away, and  must postpone the celebration of the marriage.
The vexation this gave Sir Hugh, redoubled Sir Hugh anxiety to break to Sir Hugh the evil  by degrees, if to break it to Sir Hugh at all should become indispensable.
