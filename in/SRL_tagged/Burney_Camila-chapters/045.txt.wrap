 A Pursuer  Notwithstanding the fears so justly excited from the mixt emotions and  exertions of Sir Hugh, Mr. Tyrold had the happiness to see him fall into a  tranquil sleep, from which he awoke without any return of pain; his night was  quiet; the next day was still better; and the day following he was pronounced  out of danger.  The rapture which this declaration excited in the house, and diffused  throughout the neighbourhood, when communicated to the worthy baronet, gave a  gladness to his heart that recompensed all he had suffered.  The delight of Camilla exceeded whatever she had yet experienced: her life had  lost half its value in her estimation, while she believed that of her uncle to  be in danger.  No one single quality is perhaps so endearing, from man to man, as good-nature.  Talents excite more admiration; wisdom, more respect; and virtue, more esteem:  but with admiration envy is apt to mingle, and fear with respect; while esteem,  though always honourable, is often cold: but good-nature gives pleasure without  any allay; ease, confidence, and happy carelessness, without the pain of  obligation, without the exertion of gratitude.  If joy was in some more tumultuous, content was with none so penetrating as  with Eugenia. Apprised now that she had been the immediate cause of the  sufferings of her uncle, his loss would have given to her peace a blow  irrecoverable; and she determined to bend the whole of her thoughts to his  wishes, his comfort, his entire restoration.  To this end all her virtue was called in aid; a fear, next to aversion, having  seized her of Clermont, from the apprehension she might never inspire in him  such love as she had inspired in Bellamy, nor see in him, as in young Melmond,  such merit as might raise similar sentiments for himself.  Molly Mill had not failed to paint to her the disappointment of Bellamy in not  seeing her; but she was too much engrossed by the dangerous state of her uncle,  to feel any compunction in her breach of promise; though touched with the  account of his continual sufferings, she became very gentle in her reprimands  to Molly for again meeting him; and, though Molly again disobeyed, she again  was pardoned. He came daily to the lane behind the park pales, to hear news of  the health of Sir Hugh, without pressing either for an interview or a letter;  and Eugenia grew more and more moved by his respectful obsequiousness. She had  yet said nothing to Camilla upon the subject; not only because a dearer  interest mutually occupied them, but from a secret shame of naming a lover at a  period so ungenial.  But now that Sir Hugh was in a fair way of recovery, her situation became  alarming to herself. Openly, and before the whole house, she had solemnly been  assigned to Clermont Lynmere; and, little as she wished the connexion, she  thought it, from circumstances, her duty not to refuse it. Yet this gentleman  had attended her so long, had endured so many disappointments, and borne them  so much to her satisfaction, that, though she lamented her concession as an  injury to Clermont, and grew ashamed to name it even to Camilla, she believed  it would be cruelty unheard of to break it. She determined, therefore, to see  him, to pronounce a farewell, and then to bend all her thoughts to the partner  destined her by her friends.  Molly Mill was alone to accompany her to give her negative, her good wishes,  and her solemn declaration that she could never again see or hear of him more.  He could deem it no indelicacy that she suffered Molly to be present, since she  was the negociator of his own choice.  Molly carried him, therefore, this news, with a previous condition that he was  not to detain her mistress one minute. He promised all submission; and the next  morning, after breakfast, Eugenia, in extreme dejection at the ungrateful task  she had to perform, called for Molly, and walked forth.  Camilla, who was then accidentally in her own room, was, soon after, summoned  by three smart raps to her chamber door.  There, to her great surprise, she saw Edgar, who, after a hasty apology, begged  to have a few minutes conference with her alone.  She descended with him into the parlour, which was vacant.  'You suspect, perhaps,' said he, in an hurried manner, though attempting to  smile, 'that I mean to fatigue you with some troublesome advice; I must,  therefore, by an abrupt question, explain myself. Does Mr. Bellamy still  continue his pretensions to your sister Eugenia?'  Startled in a moment from all thoughts of self, that at first had been rushing  with violence to her heart, Camilla answered, 'No! why do you ask?'  'I will tell you: In my regular visits here of late, I have almost constantly  met him, either on foot or on horseback, in the vicinity of the park. I  suspected he watched to see Eugenia; but I knew she now never left the house;  and concluded he was ignorant of the late general confinement. This moment,  however, upon my entrance, I saw him again; and, as he hastily turned away upon  meeting my eye, I dismounted, gave my horse to my man, and determined to  satisfy myself which way he was strolling. I then followed him to the little  lane to the right of the park, where I perceived an empty post-chaise-and-four  in waiting: he advanced, and spoke with the postillion—I came instantly into  the house by the little gate. This may be accidental; yet it has alarmed me;  and I ventured, therefore, thus suddenly to apply to you, in order to urge you  to give a caution to Eugenia, not to walk out, just at present, unattended.'  Camilla thanked him, and ran eagerly to speak to her sister; but she was not in  her room; nor was she with her uncle; nor yet with Dr. Orkborne. She returned  uneasily to the parlour, and said she would seek her in the park.  Edgar followed; but they looked around for her in vain: he then, deeming the  danger urgent, left her, to hasten to the spot where he had seen the  post-chaise.  Camilla ran on alone; and, when she reached the park gate, perceived her  sister, Molly Mill, and Bellamy, in the lane.  They heard her quick approach, and turned round.  The countenance of Bellamy exhibited the darkest disappointment, and that of  Eugenia the most excessive confusion. 'Now then, Sir,' she cried, 'delay our  separation no longer.'  'Ah, permit me,' said he, in a low voice, 'permit me to hope you will hear my  last sad sentence, my final misery, another day!—I will defer my mournful  departure for that melancholy joy, which is the last I shall feel in my  wretched existence!'  He sighed so deeply, that Eugenia, who seemed already in much sorrow, could not  utter an abrupt refusal; and, as Camilla now advanced, she turned from him,  without attempting to say any thing further.  Camilla, in the delight of finding her sister safe, after the horrible  apprehensions she had just experienced, could not speak to her for tears.  Abashed at once, and amazed, Eugenia faintly asked what so affected her? She  gave no explanation, but begged her to turn immediately back.  Eugenia consented; and Bellamy, bowing to them both profoundly, with quick  steps walked away.  Camilla asked a thousand questions; but Eugenia seemed unable to answer them.  In a few minutes they were joined by Edgar, who, walking hastily up to them,  took Camilla apart.  He told her he firmly believed a villainous scheme to have been laid: he had  found the chaise still in waiting, and asked the postillion to whom he  belonged. The man said he was paid for what he did; and refused giving any  account of himself. Bellamy then appeared: he seemed confounded at his sight;  but neither of them spoke; and he left him and his chaise, and his postillion,  to console one another. He doubted not, he said, but the design had been to  carry Eugenia off, and he had probably only pretended to take leave, that the  chaise might advance, and the postillion aid the elopement: though finding help  at hand, he had been forced to give up his scheme.  Camilla even with rapture blest his fortunate presence; but was confounded with  perplexity at the conduct of Eugenia. Edgar, who feared her heart was entangled  by an object who sought only her wealth, proposed dismissing Molly Mill, that  he might tell her himself the opinion he had conceived of Bellamy.  Camilla overtook her sister, who had walked on without listening to or  regarding them; and, sending away Molly, told her Edgar wished immediately to  converse with her, upon something of the utmost importance.  'You know my high esteem of him,' she answered; 'but my mind is now occupied  upon a business of which he has no information, and I entreat that you will  neither of you interrupt me.'  Camilla, utterly at a loss what to conjecture, joined Mandlebert alone, and  told him her ill success. He thought every thing was to be feared from the  present state of the affair, and proposed revealing at once all he knew of it  to Mr. Tyrold: but Camilla desired him to take no step till she had again  expostulated with her sister, who might else be seriously hurt or offended. He  complied, and said he would continue in the house, park, or environs,  incessantly upon the watch, till some decisive measure were adopted.  Joining Eugenia then again, she asked if she meant seriously to encourage the  addresses of Bellamy.  'By no means,' she quietly answered.  'My dear Eugenia, I cannot at all understand you; but it seems clear to me that  the arrival of Edgar has saved you from some dreadful violence.'  'You hurt me, Camilla, by this prejudice. From whom should I dread violence?  from a man who—but too fatally for his peace—values me more than his life?'  'If I could be sure of his sincerity,' said Camilla, 'I should be the last to  think ill of him: but reflect a little, at least, upon the risk that you have  run; my dear Eugenia! there was a post-chaise in waiting, not twenty yards from  where I stopt you!'  'Ah, you little know Bellamy! that chaise was only to convey him away; to  convey him, Camilla, to an eternal banishment!'  'But why, then, had he prevailed with you to quit the park?'  'You will call me vain if I tell you.'  'No; I shall only think you kind and confidential.'  'Do me then the justice,' said Eugenia, blushing, 'to believe me as much  surprised as yourself at his most unmerited passion: but he told me, that if I  only cast my eyes upon the vehicle which was to part him from me for ever, it  would not only make it less abhorrent to him, but probably prevent the loss of  his senses.'  'My dear Eugenia,' said Camilla, half smiling, 'this is a violent passion,  indeed, for so short an acquaintance!'  'I knew you would say that,' answered she, disconcerted; 'and it was just what  I observed to him myself: but he satisfied me that the reason of his feelings  being so impetuous was, that this was the first and only time he had ever been  in love.—So handsome as he is!—what a choice for him to make!'  Camilla, tenderly embracing her, declared, 'the choice was all that did him  honour in the affair.'  'He never,' said she, a little comforted, 'makes me any compliments; I should  else disregard, if not disdain him: but indeed he seems, notwithstanding his  own extraordinary manly beauty, to be wholly superior to external  considerations.'  Camilla now forbore expressing farther doubt, from the fear of painful  misapprehension; but earnestly entreated her to suffer Edgar to be entrusted  and consulted: she decidedly, however, refused her consent. 'I require no  advice,' cried she, 'for I am devoted to my uncle's will: to speak then of this  affair would be the most cruel indelicacy, in publishing a conquest which,  since it is rejected, I ought silently, though gratefully, to bury in my own  heart.'  She then related the history of all that had passed to Camilla; but solemnly  declared she would never, to any other human being, but him who should  hereafter be entitled to her whole heart, betray the secret of the unhappy  Bellamy.
