 Ease and Freedom  Lynmere, at tea-time, returned from his ride, with a fixed plan of frightening  or disgusting the baronet from the alliance; with Eugenia, herself, he imagined  the attempt would be vain, for he did not conceive it possible any woman who  had eyes could be induced to reject him.  Determined, therefore, to indulge, in full, both the natural presumption and  acquired luxuriance of his character, he conducted himself in a manner that, to  any thing short of the partiality of Sir Hugh, would have rendered him  insupportably offensive: but Sir Hugh had so long cherished a reverence for  what he had himself ordered with regard to his studies, and what he implicitly  credited of his attainments, that it was more easy to him to doubt his senses,  than to suppose so accomplished a scholar could do any thing but what was right.  'Your horses are worth nothing, sir,' cried he, in entering; 'I never rode so  unpleasant a beast. I don't know who has the care of your stud; but whoever it  is, he deserves to be hanged.'  Sir Hugh could not refuse, either to his justice or his kindness, to vindicate  his faithful Jacob; and for his horses he made as many excuses, as if every one  had been a human creature, whom he was recommending to his mercy, with a fear  they were unworthy of his favour.  Not a word was said more, except what Miss Margland, from time to time,  extorted, by begging questions, in praise of her tea, till Lynmere, violently  ringing the bell, called out to order a fire.  Every body was surprised at this liberty, without any previous demand of  permission from the baronet, or any inquiry into the feelings of the rest of  the company; and Sir Hugh, in a low voice, said to Eugenia, 'I am a little  afraid poor Mary will be rather out of humour to have the grate to polish again  tomorrow morning, in the case my nephew should not like to have another fire  then; which, I suppose, if the weather continues so hot, may very likely not be  agreeable to him.'  Another pause now ensued; Dr. Marchmont, who, of the whole party, was alone, at  this time, capable of leading to a general conversation, was separately  occupied by watching Camilla; while himself, as usual, was curiously and  unremittingly examined by Dr. Orkborne, in whom so much attention to a young  lady raised many private doubts of the justice of his scholastic fame; which  soon, by what he observed of his civility even to Miss Margland, were confirmed  nearly to scepticism.  Mary, now, entering with a coal scuttle and a candle, Lynmere, with much  displeasure, called out, 'Bring wood; I hate coals.'  Mary, as much displeased, and nearly as much humoured as himself, answered that  nothing but coals were ever burnt in that grate.  'Take it all away, then, and bid my man send me my pelisse. That I made to  cross the Alps in.'  'I am very sorry, indeed, nephew,' said Sir Hugh, 'that we were not better  prepared for your being so chilly, owing to the weather being set in so sultry,  that we none of us much thought of having a fire; and, indeed, in my young  time, we were never allowed thinking of such things before Michaelmas-day;  which I suppose is quite behind-hand now. Pray, nephew, if it is not too much  trouble to you, what's the day for lighting fires in foreign parts?'  'There's no rule of that sort, now, sir, in modern philosophy; that kind of  thing's completely out; entirely exploded, I give you my word.'  'Well, every thing's new, Lord help me, since I was born! But pray, nephew, if  I may ask, without tiring you too much, on account of my ignorance, have they  fires in summer as well as winter there?'  'Do you imagine there are grates and fires on the Continent, sir, the same as  in England? ha! ha!'  Sir Hugh was discountenanced from any further inquiry.  Another silence ensued, broken again by a vehement ringing of the bell.  When the servant appeared, 'What have you got,' cried Lynmere, 'that you can  bring me to eat?'  'Eat, nephew! why you would not eat before supper, when here's nobody done tea?  not that I'd have you baulk your appetite, which, to be sure, ought to be the  best judge.'  The youth ordered some oysters.  There were none in the house.  He desired a barrel might immediately be procured; he could eat nothing else.  Still Edgar, though frequent opportunities occurred, had no fortitude to  address Camilla, and no spirits to speak. To her, however, his dejection was a  revival; she read in it her power, and hoped her present plan would finally  confirm it.  A servant now came in, announcing a person who had brought two letters, one for  Sir Hugh, the other for Miss Camilla, but who said he would deliver them  himself. The baronet desired he might be admitted.  Several minutes passed, and he did not appear. The wonder of Sir Hugh was  awakened for his letter; but Camilla, dreading a billet from Sir Sedley, was in  no haste.  Lynmere, however, glad of an opportunity to issue orders, or make disturbance,  furiously rang the bell, saying: 'Where are these letters?'  'Jacob,' said the baronet, 'my nephew don't mean the slowness to be any fault  of yours, it being what you can't help; only tell the person that brought us  our letters, we should be glad to look at them, not knowing who they may be  from.'  'Why he seems but an odd sort of fish, sir; I can't much make him out; he's  been begging some flour to put in his hair; he'll make himself so spruce, he  says, we sha'n't know him again; I can't much think he's a gentleman.'  He then, however, added he had made a mistake, as there was no letter for his  master, but one for Miss Camilla, and the other for Miss Margland.  'For me?' exclaimed Miss Margland, breaking forth from a scornful silence,  during which her under lip had been busy to express her contempt of the  curiosity excited upon this subject. 'Why how dare they not tell me it was for  me? it may be from somebody of consequence, about something of importance, and  here's half a day lost before I can see it!'  She then rose to go in search of it herself, but opened the door upon Mr.  Dubster.  A ghost, could she have persuaded herself she had seen one, could not more have  astonished, though it would more have dismayed her. She drew haughtily back,  saying: 'Is there nobody else come?'  The servant answered in the negative, and she retreated to her chair.  Camilla alone was not perplext by this sight; she had, already, from the  description, suggested whom she might expect, according to the intimation given  by the ever mischievous Lionel.  Miss Margland, concluding he would turn out to be some broken tradesman,  prepared herself to expect that the letter was a petition, and watched for an  opportunity to steal out of the room.  Mr. Dubster made two or three low bows, while he had his hand upon the door,  and two or three more when he had shut it. He then cast his eyes round the  room, and espying Camilla, with a leering sort of smile, said: 'O, you're  there, ma'am! I should find you out in a hundred. I've got a letter for you,  ma'am, and another for the gentlewoman I took for your mamma; and I was not  much out in my guess, for there's no great difference, as one may say, between  a mamma and a governess; only the mother's the more natural, like.'  He then presented her a letter, which she hastily put up, not daring to venture  at a public perusal, lest it might contain not merely something ludicrous  concerning Mr. Dubster, to which she was wholly indifferent, but allusions to  Sir Sedley Clarendel, which, in the actual situation of things, might be  fatally unseasonable.  'And now,' said Mr. Dubster, 'I must give up my t'other letter, asking the  gentlewoman's pardon for not giving it before; only I was willing to give the  young lady her's first, young ladies being apt to be more in a hurry than  people a little in years.'  This address did not much add to the benevolent eagerness of Miss Margland to  read the epistle, and endeavouring to decline accepting it: 'Really,' she said,  'unless I know what it's about, I'm not much used to receiving letters in that  manner.'  'As to what it's about,' cried he, with a half suppressed simper, and nodding  his head on one side; 'that's a bit of a secret, as you'll see when you've read  it.'  'Indeed, good man, I wish you very well; but as to reading all the letters that  every body brings one, it requires more time than I can pretend to have to  spare, upon every trifling occasion.'  She would then have retired; but Mr. Dubster, stopping her, said: 'Why, if you  don't read it, ma'am, nobody'll be never the wiser for what I come about, for  it's ungain-like to speak for one's self; and the young gentleman said he'd  write to you, because, he said, you'd like it the best.'  'The young gentleman? what young gentleman?'  'Young squire Tyrold; he said you'd be as pleased as any thing to tell it to  the old gentleman yourself; for you was vast fond, he said, of matrimony.'  'Matrimony? what have I to do with matrimony?' cried Miss Margland, reddening  and bridling; 'if it's any vulgar trick of that kind, that Mr. Lionel is  amusing himself with, I'm not quite the right sort of person to be so played  upon; and I desire, mister, you'll take care how you come to me any more upon  such errands, lest you meet with your proper deserts.'  'Dear heart! I'm not going to offer anything uncivil. As to matrimony, it's no  great joke to a man, when once he's made his way in the world; it's more an  affair of you ladies by half.'  'Of us? upon my word! this is a compliment rather higher than I expected. Mr.  Lionel may find, however, I have friends who will resent such impertinence, if  he imagines he may send who he will to me with proposals of this sort.'  'Lauk, ma'am, you need not be in such a fright for nothing! however, there's  your letter, ma'am,' putting it upon the table; 'and when you are in better  cue, I suppose you'll read it.'  Then, advancing to Camilla: 'Now, ma'am, let's you and I have a little talk  together; but first, by good rights, I ought to speak to your uncle; only I  don't know which he is; 'twill be mortal kind if you'll help a body out.'  Sir Hugh was going to answer for himself, when Lynmere, fatigued with so long a  scene in which he had no share, had recourse to his friend the bell, calling  out, at the same time, in a voice of impatience, 'No oysters yet!'  Sir Hugh now began to grow unhappy for his servants; for himself he not only  could bear any thing, but still concluded he had nothing to bear; but his  domestics began all to wear long faces, and, accustomed to see them happy, he  was hurt to observe the change. No partiality to his nephew could disguise to  him, that, long used to every possible indulgence, it was vain to hope they  would submit, without murmuring, to so new a bondage of continual and  peremptory commands. Instead of attending, therefore, to Mr. Dubster, he  considered what apology to offer to Jacob; who suspecting by whom he was  summoned, did not make his appearance till Lynmere rung again.  'Where are these oysters?' he then demanded; 'have you been eating them?'  'No, sir,' answered he surlily; 'we're not so sharp set; we live in Old  England; we don't come from outlandish countries.'  This true John Bullism, Lynmere had neither sense to despise, nor humour to  laugh at; and, seriously in a rage, called out, 'Sirrah, I'll break your  bones!' and lifted up his riding switch, with which, as well as his boots, he  had re-entered the parlour.  'The Lord be good unto me!' cried Sir Hugh, 'what new ways are got into the  world! but don't take it to heart, Jacob, for as to breaking your bones, after  all your long services, it's a thing I sha'n't consent to; which I hope my  nephew won't take ill.'  Affronted with the master, and enraged with the man, Lynmere stroamed  petulantly up and down the room, with loud and marked steps, that called, or at  least disturbed the attention of every one, exclaiming, at every turning, 'A  confounded country this! a villainous country! nothing to be had in it! I don't  know what in the world to think of that there's any chance I can get!'  Sir Hugh, recovering, said he was sorry he was so badly off; and desired Jacob  not to fail procuring oysters if they were to be had within a mile.  'A mile?... ten miles! say ten miles round,' cried Lynmere, 'or you do nothing;  what's ten miles for a thing of that sort?'  'Ten miles, nephew? what? at this time of night! why you don't think, with all  your travelling, that when they've got ten miles there, they'll have ten miles  to come back, and that makes count twenty.'  'Well, sir, and suppose it was forty; what have such fellows to do better?'  Sir Hugh blessed himself, and Mr. Dubster said to Camilla: 'So, ma'am, why you  don't read your letter, neither, no more than the gentlewoman; however, I think  you may as well see a little what's in it; though I suppose no great matters,  being from a lady.'  'A lady! what lady?' cried she, and eagerly taking it from her pocket, saw the  hand-writing of Mrs. Berlinton, and inquired how it came into his possession.  He answered, that happening to meet the lady's footman, whom he had known  something of while in business, as he was going to put it to the post, he told  him he was coming to the very house, and so took it to bring himself, the man  being rather in a hurry to go another way; 'so I thought 'twas as well, ma'am,'  he added, 'to save you the postage; for as to a day or so sooner or later, I  suppose it can break no great squares, in you ladies letter-writing.'  Camilla, hastily running it over, found it contained a most pressing repetition  of invitation from Mrs. Berlinton for the Southampton plan, and information  that she should make a little circuit, to call and take her up at Cleves, if  not immediately forbidden; the time she named for her arrival, though four days  distant from the date of her letter, would be now the following morning.  This seemed, to the agitated spirits of Camilla, an inviting opening to her  scheme. She gave the letter to her uncle, saying, in a fluttered manner, she  should be happy to accompany Mrs. Berlinton, for a few days, if her father  should not disapprove the excursion, and if he could himself have the goodness  to spare one of the carriages to fetch her home, as Southampton was but sixteen  miles off.  While Sir Hugh, amazed at this request, yet always unable to pronounce a  negative to what she desired, stammered, Edgar abruptly took leave.  Thunderstruck by his departure, she looked affrighted, after him, with a sigh  impossible to repress; she now first weighed the hazard of what she was doing,  the deep game she was inconsiderately playing. Would it sunder ... would it  unite them?... Tears started into her eyes at the doubt; she did not hear her  uncle's answer; she rose to hurry out of the room; but before she could escape,  the big drops rolled fast down her cheeks; and, when arrived at her chamber, 'I  have lost him!' she cried, 'by my own unreflecting precipitance; I have lost  him, perhaps, for ever!'  Dr. Marchmont now also took leave; Mr. Dubster desired he might speak with the  baronet the next morning; and the family remained alone.
