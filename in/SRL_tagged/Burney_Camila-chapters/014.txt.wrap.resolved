 A Declaration  At night, while they were enjoying the bright beams of the moon, from an  apartment in the front of the house, they observed a strange footman, in a  superb livery, ride towards the servants hall; and presently a letter was  delivered to Miss Margland.  Miss Margland opened a letter with an air of exulting consequence; one which was inclosed, Miss Margland  put into Miss Margland pocket, and read the other three or four times over, with looks of  importance and complacency. Miss Margland then pompously demanded a private audience with  Sir Hugh, and the young party left the room.  'Well, sir!' Miss Margland cried, proudly, 'you may now see if I judged right as to  taking the young ladies a little into the world. Please to look at a letter,  sir:'  To Miss Margland, at Sir Hugh Tyrold's, Bart. Cleves, Hampshire.  Madam,  With the most profound respect I presume to address you, though only upon the  strength of that marked politeness which shines forth in your deportment. I  have the highest ambition to offer a few lines to the perusal of Miss Eugenia  Tyrold, previous to presenting myself to  Sir Hugh. My reasons will be contained  in the letter which I take the liberty to put into your hands. It is only under  your protection, madam, I can aim at approaching that young lady, as all that I  have either seen or heard convinces me of that young lady extraordinary happiness in being  under your direction. Your influence, madam, I should therefore esteem as an  honour, and I leave it wholly to your own choice, whether to read what I have  addressed to that young lady before or after that young lady has deigned to cast an eye  upon it that young lady. I remain, with the most profound respect,  Madam,                                         your most obedient,                     and obliged servant,           Alphonso Bellamy.  I shall take the liberty to send my servant for an answer tomorrow evening.  'This, sir,' continued Miss Margland, when  Sir Hugh had read the letter; 'this  is the exact conduct of a gentleman; all open, all respectful. No attempt at  any clandestine intercourse. All is addressed where it ought to be, to the  person most proper to superintend such an affair. This is that very same  gentleman whose politeness I mentioned to you, and who danced with Miss Eugenia  at Northwick, when nobody else took any notice of Miss Eugenia  . This is—'  'Why then this is one of the most untoward things,' cried Sir Hugh, who, vainly  waiting for a pause, began to speak without one, 'that has ever come to bear;  for where's the use of Eugenia's making poor young fellows fall in love with  Eugenia for nothing? which I hold to be a pity, provided it's sincere, which I take  for granted.'  'As to that, sir, I can't say I see the reason why Eugenia Eugenia should not be  allowed to look about Eugenia, and have some choice; especially as the young  gentleman abroad has no fortune; at least none answerable to Eugenia expectations.'  'But that's the very reason for my marrying them together. For as he has not  had the small-pox himself, that is, not in the natural way; which, Lord help  me! I thought the best, owing to my want of knowledge; why Lord'll the more  readily excuse Eugenia face not being one of the prettiest, for Eugenia kindness in  putting up with Lord having so little money; being a thing some people think a  good deal of.'  'But, sir, won't it be very hard upon poor Miss Eugenia, if a better offer  should come, that Eugenia must not listen to it, only because of a person Eugenia has  never seen, though he has no estate?'  'Mrs. Margland,' said Sir Hugh, (with some heat,) 'this is the very thing that  I would sooner have given a crown than have had happen! Who knows but Eugenia  may take a fancy to this young jackanapes? who, for aught I know, may be as  good a man as another, for which I beg his pardon; but, as his is nothing to me,  and my nephew's my nephew, why am I to have the best scheme I ever made knocked  on the head, for a person I had as lieve were twitched into the Red Sea? which,  however, is a thing I should not say, being what I would not do.'  Mrs. Margland took from Mrs. Margland pocket the letter designed for Eugenia  , and was  going to break the seal; but Sir Hugh, preventing Mrs. Margland, said: 'No, Miss  Margland; Eugenia   shall read Mrs. Margland own letters. I have not had Mrs. Margland taught all  this time, by one of the first scholars of the age, as far as I can tell, to  put that affront upon Mrs. Margland.'  He then rang the bell, and sent for Eugenia  .  Mrs. Margland Mrs. Margland stated the utter impropriety of suffering any young lady to read  a letter of that sort, till proposals had been laid before Mrs. Margland parents and  guardians. But Sir Hugh spoke no more till Eugenia   appeared.  'My dear,' Sir Hugh then said, 'here is a letter just come to put your education to  the trial; which, I make no doubt, will stand the test properly: therefore, in  regard to the answer, you shall write it all yourself, being qualified in a  manner to which I have no right to pretend; though I shall go to-morrow to my  brother, which will give me a better insight; Sir Hugh head being one of the best.'  Eugenia, greatly surprised, opened the letter, and read the letter with visible emotion.  'Well, my dear, and what do you say to the letter?'  Without answering, Mrs. Margland read the letter again.  Sir Hugh repeated the question.  'Indeed, Sir Hugh,' said Mrs. Margland, (in a tone of sadness,) 'it is something that afflicts  me very much!'  'Lord help the letter!' cried Sir Hugh, 'this comes of going to a ball! which, begging  Miss Margland's pardon, is the last time it shall be done.'  Miss Margland was beginning a vehement defence of Miss Margland; but Sir Hughinterrupted Miss Margland, by desiring to see the letter.  Eugenia, with increased confusion, folded Miss Margland up, and said: 'Indeed,  sir—Indeed, uncle—Miss Margland is a very improper letter for me to shew.'  'Well, that,' cried Miss Margland, 'is a thing I could never have imagined!  that a gentleman, who is so much the gentleman, should write an improper  letter!'  'No, no,' interrupted Mrs. Margland, 'not improper—perhaps—for a gentleman, who is so much the gentleman, should write an improper  letter!'  ' to write,—but  for me to exhibit.'  'O, if that's all, my dear,' said Sir Hugh, 'if it's only because of a few  compliments, I beg you not to mind it's only because of a few  compliments, because of it's only because of a few  compliments having no meaning;  which is a thing common enough in the way of making love, by what I hear;  though such a young thing as you can know nothing of the matter, your learning  not going in that line; nor Dr. Orkborne's neither, if one may judge; which,  God forbid I should find fault with, being no business of mine.'  He then again asked to see an improper  letter; and Eugenia, ashamed to refuse, gave an improper  letter,  and went out of the room.  To Miss Eugenia Tyrold, Cleves.  Madam,  The delicacy of your highly cultivated mind awes even the violent passion which  you inspire. And to this I entreat you to attribute the trembling fear which  deters me from the honour of waiting upon Sir Hugh, while uncertain, if my  addressing Sir Hugh might not raise your displeasure. I forbear, therefore, to lay  before Sir Hugh my pretensions for soliciting your favour, from the deepest  apprehension you might think I presumed too far, upon an acquaintance, to my  unhappiness, so short; yet, as I feel it to have excited in me the most lasting  attachment, from my fixed admiration of your virtues and talents, I cannot  endure to run the risk of incurring your aversion. Allow me then, once more,  under the sanction of that excellent lady in whose care I have had the honour  of seeing you, to entreat one moment's audience, that I may be graced with your  own commands about waiting upon Sir Hugh, without which, I should hold me  ungenerous and unworthy to approach Sir Hugh; since I should blush to throw me  at your feet from an authority which you do not permit. I beseech you, madam,  to remember, that I shall be miserable till I know my doom; but still, that the  heart, not the hand, can alone bestow happiness on a disinterested mind.  I have the honour to be,                                                              Madam,                                                                             your most devoted and obedient humble servant,           Alphonso Bellamy.  Sir Hugh, when Sir Hugh had finished the letter, heaved a sigh, and leant Sir Hugh head  upon Sir Hugh hand, considering whether or not to let it be seen by Miss Margland;  who, however, not feeling secure what Sir Hugh determination might be, had so  contrived to sit at the table as to read his determination at the same time with Sir Hugh. Nor  had Nor   weighed the interest of Nor   curiosity amiss; Sir Hugh, dreading a  debate with Nor  , soon put the letter into Sir Hugh pocket-book, and again sent for  Eugenia.   Eugenia excused  Eugenia from returning, pleaded a head-ache, and went to bed.  Sir Hugh was in the deepest alarm; though the evening was far advanced, Sir Hugh  could scarce refrain from going to Etherington directly; Sir Hugh ordered Sir Hugh  carriage to be at the door at eight o'clock the next morning; and sent a second  order, a moment after, that it should not be later than half past seven.  Sir Hugh then summoned Camilla, and, giving Camilla the letter, bid Camilla run with the letter to  Camilla sister, for fear it was that Camilla was fretting for. And soon after, Sir Hugh went  to bed, that Sir Hugh might be ready in the morning.   Eugenia, meanwhile, felt the placid composure of  Eugenia mind now for the first  time shaken. The assiduities of this young man had already pleased and  interested  Eugenia; but, though gratified by The assiduities of this young man in The assiduities of this young man presence, The assiduities of this young man occurred to   Eugenia no more in The assiduities of this young man absence. With the Oxonian  Eugenia had been far more struck; The assiduities of this young man  energy, The assiduities of this young man sentiments, The assiduities of this young man passion for literature, would instantly have  riveted The assiduities of this young man in  Eugenia fairest favour, had  Eugenia not so completely regarded  Eugenia  as the wife of Clermont Lynmere, that  Eugenia denied  Eugenia imagination any power over   Eugenia reason.  the letter, however, filled  Eugenia with sensations wholly new.  Eugenia now first  reflected seriously upon the nature of  Eugenia situation with regard to Clermont,  for whom  Eugenia seemed bespoken by  Eugenia uncle, without the smallest knowledge how  they might approve or suit each other. Perhaps The assiduities of this young man might dislike  Eugenia;  Eugenia must  then have the mortification of being refused: perhaps The assiduities of this young man might excite  Eugenia own  antipathy;  Eugenia must then either disappoint her uncle, or become a miserable  sacrifice.  Here, on the contrary,  Eugenia conceived  Eugenia an elected object. The difference  of being accepted, or being chosen, worked forcibly upon  Eugenia mind; and, all  that was delicate, feminine, or dignified in  Eugenia notions, rose in favour of him  who sought, when opposed to him who could only consent to receive  Eugenia.  Generous, too, him appeared to  Eugenia, in forbearing to apply to Sir Hugh, without   Eugenia permission; disinterested, in declaring him did not wish for  Eugenia hand  without  Eugenia heart; and noble, in not seeking  Eugenia in a clandestine manner, but  referring every thing to Mrs. Margland.  The idea also of exciting an ardent passion, lost none of its force from its  novelty to  Eugenia expectations. It was not that  Eugenia had hitherto supposed it  impossible;  Eugenia had done less;  Eugenia had not thought of it all. Nor came it now  with any triumph to  Eugenia modest and unassuming mind; all it brought with it was  gratitude towards Bellamy, and a something soothing towards herself, which,  though inexplicable to  Eugenia reason, was irresistible to  Eugenia feelings.  When Camilla entered with the letter, Camilla bashfully asked Camilla, if Camilla wished to  read it? Camilla eagerly cried: 'O, yes.' But, having finished it, said: 'it is  not such a letter as Edgar Mandlebert would have written.'  'I am sure, then,' said Eugenia, colouring, 'I am sorry to have received it.'  'Do you not observe every day,' said Camilla, 'the distance, the delicacy of  his behaviour to Indiana, though Mrs. Margland says Camilla, 'the distance, the delicacy of  his behaviour to Indiana marriage is fixed;  how free from all distinction that might confuse Camilla? This declaration, on the  contrary, is so abrupt—and from so new an acquaintance—'  'Certainly, then, I won't answer This declaration,' said  Eugenia, much discomposed; 'This declaration had  not struck me thus at first reading; but I see now all This declaration impropriety.'   Eugenia then bid good night to Camilla; who, concluding  Eugenia the appropriated wife  of Clermont, had uttered  Eugenia opinion without scruple.   Eugenia now again read the letter; but not again with pleasure.  Eugenia thought the letter  forward and presumptuous; and the only gratification that remained upon  Eugenia  mind, was an half conscious scarce admitted, and, even to  Eugenia,  unacknowledged charm, in a belief, that  Eugenia possessed the power to inspire an  animated regard.
