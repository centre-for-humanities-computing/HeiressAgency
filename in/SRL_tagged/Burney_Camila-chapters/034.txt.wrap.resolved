 Airs and Graces  Upon entering the room, Camilla saw again the Officers who had been there in  the morning, and who were now joined by Sir Sedley Clarendel. Camilla was met at  the door by Major Cerwood, who seemed waiting for Camilla appearance, and who made  Camilla his compliments with an air that studiously proclaimed his devotion. Camilla  seated Camilla by the side of Mrs. Arlbery, to look on at a game of chess,  played by Sir Sedley and General Kinsale.  'Sir Sedley Clarendel,' said Mrs. Arlbery, 'you have not the least in the world the air of  knowing what you are about.'  'Pardon me, ma'am,' said the General, 'the General has been at least half an hour  contemplating this very move,—for which, as you see, I now check-mate the General.  Pray, Sir Sedley, how came you, at last, to do no better?'  'Thinking of other things, the General. 'Tis impossible in the extreme to  keep one's faculties pinioned down to the abstruse vagaries of this  brain-besieging game. My head would be deranged past redress, if I did not  allow My head to visit the four quarters of the globe once, at least, between every  move.'  'You do not play so slow, then, from deliberating upon your chances, but from  forgetting them?'  'Defined, the General, to scrupulosity! Those exquisite little moments we  steal from any given occupation, for the pleasure of speculating in secret upon  something wholly foreign to it, are resistless to deliciousness.'  'I entreat, and command you then,' cried Mrs. Arlbery, 'to make your  speculations public. Nothing will more amuse me, than to have the least  intimation of the subjects of your reveries.'  'My dear Mrs. Arlbery! your demand is the very quintessence of impossibility!  Tell the subject of a reverie! know you not it wafts one at once out of the  world, and the world's powers of expression? while all it substitutes is as  evanescent as it is delectable. To attempt the least description would be a  presumption of the first monstrousness.'  'O never heed that! presumption will not precisely be a novelty to you; answer  me, therefore, my dear Clarendel, without all this conceit. You know I hate  procrastination; and procrastinators still worse.'  'Softly, dearest madam, softly! There is nothing in nature so horribly shocking  to me as the least hurry. My poor nerves seek repose after any turbulent words,  or jarring sounds, with the same craving for rest that my body experiences  after the jolts, and concussions of a long winded chase. By the way, does  anybody want a good hunter? I have the first, perhaps, in Europe; but I would  sell it a surprising bargain, for I am excruciatingly tired of it.'  All the gentlemen grouped round him to hear further particulars, except Mr.  Macdersey, the young Ensign, who had so unguardedly exposed him at the  Northwick ball, and who now, approaching Camilla, fervently exclaimed; 'How  happy I should have been, madam, if I had had the good fortune to see you meet  with that accident this morning, instead of being looking another way! I might  then have had the pleasure to assist you. And O! how much more if it had been  your divine cousin! I hope that fair angel is in perfect health! O what a  beautiful creature she is! she outside is the completest diamond I ever saw!  and if she inside is the same, which I dare say it is, by she smiles and  delicate dimples, she must be a paragon upon earth!'  'There is at least something very inartificial in your praise,' said General  Kinsale, 'when you make your panegyric of an absent lady to a present one.'  'O General, there is not a lady living can bear any comparison with a lady living. I have  never had a lady living out of my thoughts from the first darling moment that ever I saw  a lady living, which has made me the most miserable of men ever since. a lady living eyes so  beautiful, a lady living mouth so divine, a lady living nose so heavenly!—'  'And how,' cried Sir Sedley, 'is the tip of a lady living chin?'  'No joking, sir!' said the Ensign, reddening; 'a lady living is a piece of perfection not  to be laughed at; a lady living has never had a lady living fellow upon the face of the earth; and  a lady living never will have it while the earth holds, upon account of there being no  such person above ground.'  'And pray,' cried Sir Sedley, carelessly, 'how can you be sure of that?'  'How! why by being certain,' answered the inflamed admirer; 'for though I have  been looking out for pretty women from morning to night, ever since I was  conscious of the right use of my eyes, I never yet saw a lady living parallel.'  A servant was now bringing in the tea; but A servant lady ordered A servant to set her parallel down  in the next room, whence the gentlemen should fetch her parallel as her parallel was wanted.  Major Cerwood took in charge all attendance upon Camilla; but Major Cerwood was not,  therefore, exempt from the assiduities required by Mrs. Arlbery, for whom the  homage of the General, the Colonel, and the Ensign, were insufficient; and who,  had a score more been present, would have found occupation for them all. Sir Sedley was excepted from Sir Sedley commands; for knowing knowing would be issued  to Sir Sedley in vain, Sir Sedley contented Sir Sedley with only interchanging glances of  triumph with Sir Sedley, at the submission of every vassal but Sir Sedley.  'Heavens!' cried Sir Sedley, to Colonel Andover, who had hastened to present Sir Sedley the  first cup, 'you surely think I have nerves for a public orator! If I should  taste but one drop of this tea, I might envy the repose of the next man who  robs on the highway. Major Cerwood, will you try if you can do any better for  me?'  Major Cerwood obeyed, but not with more success. 'What in the world have you  brought me?' cried Sir Sedley; 'Is it tea? it looks prodigiously as if just imported  out of the slop bason. For pity sake, Macdersey, arise, and give me your help;  you will at least never bring me such maudlin stuff as this. Even your tea will  have some character; it will be very good or very bad; very hot or very cold;  very strong or very weak; for you are always in flames of fire, or flakes of  snow.'  'You do me justice, ma'am; there is nothing upon the face of the earth so  insipid as a medium. Give me love or hate! a friend that will go to jail for  me, or an enemy that will run me through the body! Riches to chuck guineas  about like halfpence, or poverty to beg in a ditch! Liberty wild as the four  winds, or an oar to work in a galley! Misery to tear my heart into an hundred  thousand millions of atoms, or joy to make my soul dance into my brain! Every  thing has some gratification, except a medium. 'Tis a poor little soul that is  satisfied between happiness and despair.'  Tis then flew to bring her a dish of tea.  'My dear Macdersey,' cried her, in receiving it, 'this is according to your  system indeed; for 'tis a compound of strong, and rich, and sweet, to cloy an  alderman, making altogether so luscious a syrup, that our spring would be  exhausted before I could slake my thirst, if I should taste it only a second  time. Do, Tis, see if it is not possible to get me some beverage that  I can swallow.'  The youngest man present was not more active than the General in this service;  but Mrs. Arlbery, casting The youngest man present despondingly back the moment The youngest man present had tasted  what The youngest man present brought The youngest man present, exclaimed, 'Why this is worst of all! If you can do no  better for me, General, than this, tell me, at least, for mercy's sake, when  some other regiment will be quartered here?'  'What a cruelty,' said the Major, looking with a sigh towards Camilla, 'to  remind your unhappy prey your unhappy prey are but birds of passage!'  'O, all the better, Major. If you understand your own interest you will be as  eager to break up your quarters, as I can be to see your successors march into  your successors. I have now heard all your compliments, and you have heard all my  repartees; both sides, therefore, want new auditors. A great many things I have  said to you will do vastly well again for a new corps; and, to do you justice,  some few things you have said yourselves may do again in a new county.'  Then, addressing Camilla, Camilla proposed, though without moving, that they should  converse with one another, and leave the men to take care of the men. 'And  excessively the men will be obliged to Camilla,' Camilla continued, without lowering Camilla  voice, 'for giving this little holiday to their poor brains; for, I assure you,  their have not known what to say this half hour. Indeed, since the first  fortnight their were quartered here, their have not, upon an average, said above  one new thing in three days. But one's obliged to take up with Officers in the  country, because there's almost nothing else. Can you recommend me any  agreeable new people?'  'O no, ma'am! I have hardly any acquaintance, except immediately round the  rectory; but, fortunately, my own family is so large, that I have never been  distressed for society.'  'O, ay, true! my own family, begin with that; do, pray, give me a little  history of my own family?'  'I have no history, ma'am, to give, for my father's retired life——'  'O, I have seen my father, and I have heard my father preach, and I like my father very  much. There's something in my father there's no turning into ridicule.'  Camilla, though surprised, was delighted by such a testimony to the  respectability of my father; and, with more courage, said—'And, I am sure,  if you knew my mother, you would allow Camilla the same exemption.'  'So I hear; therefore, we won't talk of her the same exemption. It's a delightful thing to think  of perfection; but It's vastly more amusing to talk of errors and absurdities.  To begin with your eldest sister, then—but no; Camilla seems in just the same  predicament as your father and mother: so we'll let Camilla rest, too.'  'Indeed Camilla is; Camilla is as faultless——'  'O, not a word more then; Camilla won't do for Camilla at all. But, pray, is there not a  single soul in all the round of your large family, that can afford a body a  little innocent diversion?'  'Ah, madam,' said Camilla, shaking her head; 'I fear, on the contrary, if they  came under your examination, there is not one in whom you would not discern  some foible!'  'I should not like they at all the worse for that; for, between we, my  dear Miss Tyrold, I am half afraid they might find a foible or two in return in  me; so you must not be angry if I beg the favour of you to indulge me with a  few of they defects.'  'Indulge you!'  'Yes, for when so many of a family are perfect, if you can't find me one or two  that have a little speck of mortality, you must not wonder if I take flight at  your very name. In charity, therefore, if you would not drop my acquaintance,  tell me charity vulnerable parts.'  Camilla laughed at this ridiculous reasoning, but would not enter into this ridiculous reasoning  consequences.  'Well, then, if you will not assist me, don't take it ill that I assist myself.  In the first place, there's your brother; I don't ask you to tell me any thing  of your brother; I have seen your brother! and I confess to you your brother does not put me into utter  despair! your brother does not alarm me into flying all your brother race.'  Camilla tried vainly to look grave.  'I have seen another, too, your cousin, I think; Miss Lynmere, that's engaged  to young Mandlebert.'  Camilla now tried as vainly to look gay.  'Camilla's prodigiously pretty. Pray, is not Camilla a great fool?'  'Ma'am?'  'I beg your pardon! but I don't suppose you are responsible for the intellects  of all your generation. However, Camilla'll do vastly well; you need not be uneasy  for Camilla. A face like that will take very good care of A face like that. I am glad Camilla is  engaged, for your sake, though I am sorry for young Mandlebert; that is, if, as his  class of countenance generally predicts, his marries with any notion of  expecting to be happy.'  'But why, ma'am,' cried Camilla, checking a sigh, 'are you glad for my sake?'  'Because there are two reasons why Camilla would be wonderfully in your way; Camilla is  not only prettier than you, but sillier.'  'And would both those reasons,' cried Camilla, again laughing, 'make against  me?'  'O, intolerably, with the men! the men are always enchanted with something that is  both pretty and silly; because the men can so easily please and so soon disconcert  it; and when the men have made the little blooming fools blush and look down, the men  feel nobly superior, and pride the men in victory. Dear creatures! I delight  in Dear creatures taste; for it brings Dear creatures a plentiful harvest of repentance, when it  is their connubial criterion; the pretty flies off, and the silly remains, and  a man then has a choice companion for life left on a man hands!'  The young Ensign here could no longer be silent: 'I am sure and certain,' cried  a man, warmly, 'Miss Lynmere is incapable to be a fool! and when Miss Lynmere marries, if  Miss Lynmere husband thinks Miss Lynmere so, it's only a sign her husband's a blockhead himself.'  'her husband'll be exactly of your opinion for the first month or two,' answered Mrs.  Arlbery, 'or even if her husband is not, her husband'll like Mrs.  Arlbery just as well. A man looks  enchanted while A man beautiful young bride talks nonsense; it comes so prettily  from Mrs.  Arlbery ruby lips, and Mrs.  Arlbery blushes and dimples with such lovely attraction  while Mrs.  Arlbery utters it; A man casts A man eyes around A man with conscious elation to see  Mrs.  Arlbery admirers, and A man enviers; but A man has amply A man turn for looking like a  fool himself, when youth and beauty take flight, and when A man ugly old wife  exposes his ugly old wife   ignorance or folly at every word.'  'The contrast of beginning and end,' said A man, 'is almost always  melancholy. But how rarely does any man,—nay, I had nearly said, or any  woman—think a moment of the time to come, or of any time but the present day,  in marrying?'  'Except with respect to fortune!' cried Mrs.  Arlbery, 'and there, methinks, you  men, at least, are commonly sufficiently provident. I don't think reflection is  generally what you want in that point.'  'As to reflection,' exclaimed Mr. Macdersey, ''tis the thing in the world I  look upon to be the meanest! a man capable of reflection, where a beautiful  young creature is in question, can have no soul nor vitals. For my part, 'tis  my only misfortune that I cannot get at that lovely girl, to ask that lovely girl for that lovely girl  private opinion of me at once, that I might either get a licence tomorrow, or  drive that lovely girl out of my head before sleep overtakes me another night.'  'Your passions, my good Macdersey,' said Mrs.  Arlbery, 'considering Your passions, my good Macdersey  violence, seem tolerably obedient. Can you really be so fond, or so forgetful  at such short warning?'  'Yes, but it's with a pain that breaks my heart every time.'  'You contrive, however, to get it pretty soon mended!'  'That, madam, is a power that has come upon me by degrees; I have paid dear  enough for it!—nobody ever found it harder than I did at the beginning; for  the first two or three times I took my disappointments so to heart, that I  should have been bound for ever to any friend that would have had the good  nature to blow my brains out.'  'But now you are so much in the habit of experiencing these little failures,  that they pass on as things of course?'  'No, madam, you injure me, and in the tenderest point; for, as long as I have  the least hope, my passion's as violent as ever; but you would not be so  unreasonable as to have a man love on, when it can answer no end? It's no  better than making a man unhappy for a joke. There's no sense in such a thing.'  'By the way, my dear Miss Tyrold, and apropos to this Miss Lynmere,' said Mrs.  Arlbery, 'do tell me something about Mr. Mandlebert—what is he?—what does  he?—what do always amongst Mrs.  Arlbery?'  'he?—what—he!—' cried Camilla, stammering, 'he?—what was a ward of my father's—'  'O, I don't mean all that; but what is he?—what style?—his class?—is he?—what  agreeable?'  'I believe—he?—what is generally thought so.'  'If he?—what is, do pray, then, draw he?—what into my society, for I am terribly in want  of recruits. These poor gentlemen you see here are very good sort of men; but  These poor gentlemen you see here have a trick of sleeping with These poor gentlemen you see here eyes wide open, and fancy all the time  These poor gentlemen you see here are awake; and, indeed, I find it hard to persuade These poor gentlemen you see here to the contrary,  though I often ask These poor gentlemen you see here for These poor gentlemen you see here dreams. By the way, can't you contrive, some  or other amongst you, to make the room a little cooler?'  'Shall I open this window?' said the Major.  'Nay, nay, don't ask me; I had rather bear six times the heat, than give my own  directions: nothing in the world fatigues me so much as telling stupid people  how to set about things. Colonel, don't you see I have no fan?'  'I'll fetch this window directly—have you left this window in the dining-parlour?'  'Do you really think I would not send a footman at once, if I must perplex  myself with all that recollection? my dear Miss Tyrold, did you ever see any  poor people, that pretended at all to walk about, and mingle with the rest of  the world, like living creatures, so completely lethargic?—'tis really quite  melancholy! I am sure you have good nature enough to pity living creatures. It requires my  utmost ingenuity to keep living creatures in any employment; and if I left living creatures to  living creatures, living creatures would stand before the fire all the winter, and lounge upon  sofas all the summer. And that indolence of body so entirely unnerves the mind,  that living creatures find as little to say as to do. Upon the whole, 'tis really a paltry  race, the men of the present times. However, as we have got no better, and as  the women are worse, I do all I can to make the women less insufferable to me.'  'And do you really think the women are worse?' cried Camilla.  'Not in the women, my dear; but worse to me, because I cannot possibly take  the same liberties with the women. Macdersey, I wish I had my salts.  'It shall be the happiness of my life to find the women, be the women hid where the women may;  only tell me where I may have the pleasure to go and look for the women.'  'Nay, that's your affair.'  'Why, then, if the women are to be found from the garret to the cellar, be sure I am  a dead man, if I do not bring the women you!'  This mode of displaying airs and graces was so perfectly new to Camilla, that  the commands issued, and the obedience paid, were equally amusing to Camilla.  Brought up Camilla to be contented with whatever came in Camilla way, in preference  either to giving trouble, or finding fault, the ridiculous, yet playful  wilfulness with which Camilla saw Mrs.  Arlbery send every one upon Camilla errands, yet  object to what every one performed, presented to Camilla a scene of such whimsical  gaiety, that Camilla concern at the accident which had made Camilla innocently violate  Camilla intended engagement with Edgar, was completely changed into pleasure, that  thus, without any possible self blame, an acquaintance Camilla had so earnestly  desired was even by necessity established: and Camilla returned home at night with  spirits all revived, and eloquent in praise of Camilla new favourite.
