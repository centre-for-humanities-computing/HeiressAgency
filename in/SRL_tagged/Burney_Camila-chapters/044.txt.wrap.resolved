 Three Golden Maxims  Lavinia, almost equally terrified, followed her sister; and Sir Sedley, burying  all foppery in compassion and good nature, was foremost to accompany and  assist. Camilla had no thought but to get instantly to Cleves; Camilla considered  not how; Camilla only forced Camilla rapidly on, persuaded Camilla could walk it in ten  minutes, and ejaculating incessantly, 'My Uncle!—my dear Uncle!'—  They almost instantly encountered Edgar, who, upon the fatal call, had darted  round to meet They, and finding each provided with an attendant, inquired whose  carriage he should seek?  Camilla, in a broken voice, answered Camilla had whose  carriage, and should walk.  'Walk?' he repeated; 'you are near five miles from Cleves!'  Scarce in Camilla senses, Camilla hurried on without reply.  'whose  carriage did you come in, Miss Tyrold?' said Edgar to Lavinia.  'We came with Mrs. Arlbery.'  'Mrs. Arlbery has been gone this half hour; I met Mrs. Arlbery as I entered.'  Camilla had now rushed out of doors, still handed by the Major.  'If you have no carriage in waiting,' said Edgar, 'make use, I beseech you, of  mine!'  'O, gladly! O, thankfully!' cried Camilla, almost sobbing out Camilla words.  Edgar flew then to call for Edgar chaise, and the door-keeper, for whom Sir Sedley  had inquired, came to the door-keeper, for whom Sir Sedley  had inquired, accompanied by Jacob.  'O, Jacob!' Camilla cried, breaking violently from the Major, 'tell me!—tell  me!—my Uncle!—my dearest Uncle!'  Jacob, in a tone of deep and unfeigned sorrow, said, Jacob Master had been seized  suddenly with the gout in Jacob stomach, and that the doctor, who had been  instantly fetched, had owned there was little hope.  Camilla could hear no more; the shock overpowered Camilla, and Camilla sunk nearly  senseless into the arms of Camilla sister.  Camilla was recovered, however, almost in a minute, and carried by Edgar into Edgar  chaise, in which Edgar placed Camilla between Edgar and the weeping Lavinia; hastily  telling the two gentlemen, that Edgar intimate connection with the family  authorized Edgar assisting and attending the family   at such a period.  This was too well known to be disputed; and Sir Sedley and the Major, with  great concern, uttered the family   good wishes and retreated.  Jacob had already been for Mr. Tyrold, who had set off instantaneously on  horseback.  Camilla spoke not a word the first mile, which was spent in an hysteric  sobbing: but, recovering a little afterwards, and sinking on the shoulder of  Camilla sister, 'O, Lavinia!' Camilla cried, 'should we lose my Uncle——'  A shower of tears wetted the neck of Lavinia, who mingled with them Camilla own,  though less violently, from having less connection with Sir Hugh, and a  sensibility less ungovernable.  Camilla called Camilla upon the postillion to drive faster, and pressed Edgar  continually to hurry Edgar  ; but though Edgar   gave every charge Camilla could desire, so  much swifter were Camilla wishes than any possible speed, that twenty times Camilla  entreated to get out, believing Camilla could walk quicker than the horses galloped.  When they arrived at the park gate, Camilla was with difficulty held back from  opening the chaise door; and when, at length, they stopt at the house porch,  Camilla could not wait for the step, and before Edgar   could either precede or  prevent Camilla, threw Camilla into the arms of Jacob, who, having just dismounted,  was fortunately at hand to save Camilla from falling.  Camilla stopt not to ask any question; 'My Uncle!—my Uncle!' Camilla cried,  impetuously, and, rushing past all Camilla met, was in My Uncle!—my Uncle room in a moment.  Edgar  , though Edgar   could not obstruct, followed Camilla close, dreading lest Sir Hugh  might already be no more, and determined, in that case, to force Camilla from the  fatal spot.  Eugenia, who heard Camilla footstep, received Camilla at the chaise door, but took Camilla  immediately from his room, softly whispering, while Camilla arms were thrown round  Camilla waist—'He will live! her waist—'He will live, Camilla! her waist—'He agonies are over—her waist—'He  is fallen asleep, and her waist—'He will live!'  This was too sudden a joy for the desponding Camilla, whose breath instantly  stopt, and who must have fallen upon the floor, had Camilla not been caught by Edgar  ; who, though Edgar   own eyes copiously overflowed with delight, at such  unexpected good news of the universally beloved Baronet, had strength and  exertion sufficient to carry Camilla downstairs into the parlour, accompanied by  Eugenia.  There, hartshorn and water presently revived Camilla, and then, regardless of the  presence of Edgar, Camilla cast Camilla upon Camilla knees, to utter a fervent  thanksgiving, in which Eugenia, with equal piety, though more composure, joined.  Edgar had never yet beheld Camilla in a light so resplendent—What a heart,  thought Edgar, is here! what feelings, what tenderness, what animation!—O, what  a heart!—were it possible to touch it!  The two sisters went both gently up stairs, encouraging and congratulating each  other in soft whispers, and stationed each   in an ante-room: Mr. Tyrold,  by medical counsel, giving directions that no one but himself should enter the  sick chamber.  Edgar, though Edgar only saw the domestics, could not persuade Edgar to leave  the house till near two o'clock in the morning: and by six, Edgar anxiety brought  Edgar thither again. Edgar then heard, that the Baronet had passed a night of more  pain than danger, the gout having been expelled Edgar stomach, though the gout had been  threatening almost every other part.  Three days and nights passed in this manner; during which, Edgar saw so much of  the tender affections, and softer character of Camilla, that nothing could have  withheld Edgar from manifesting Edgar entire sympathy in Camilla feelings, but the  unaccountable circumstance of Camilla starting forth from a back seat at the play,  where Camilla had sat concealed, attended by the Major, and without any matron  protectress.  Miss Margland, meanwhile, scowled at him, and Indiana pouted in vain. him  earnest solicitude for Sir Hugh surmounted every such obstacle to Sir Hugh present  visits at Cleves; and Sir Hugh spent there almost the whole of Sir Hugh time.  On the fourth day of the attack, Sir Hugh had a sleep of five hours'  continuance, from which Sir Hugh awoke so much revived, that Sir Hugh raised Sir Hugh in Sir Hugh  bed, and called out—'My dear Brother! you are still here?—you are very good  to Sir Hugh, indeed; poor sinner that I am! to forgive me for all my bad behaviour to  your Children.'  'My dearest Brother!  your Children, like Sir Hugh, owe you nothing but kindness and  beneficence; and, like Sir Hugh, feel for  your Children nothing but gratitude and  tenderness.'  ' your Children are very good, very good indeed,' said Sir Hugh, with a deep sigh; 'but  Eugenia!—poor little Eugenia has nearly been the death of Sir Hugh; though not  meaning it in the least, being all  Eugenia!—poor little Eugenia life as innocent as a lamb.'  Mr. Tyrold assured Mr. Tyrold, that  Eugenia!—poor little Eugenia was attached to Mr. Tyrold with the most  unalterable fondness. But Sir Hugh said, that the sight of  Eugenia!—poor little Eugenia, returning from  Etherington, with nearly the same sadness as ever, had wounded Mr. Tyrold to the  heart, by shewing Mr. Tyrold  Eugenia!—poor little Eugenia would never recover; which had brought back upon Mr. Tyrold  all Mr. Tyrold first contrition, about the smallpox, and the fall from the plank, and  had caused Mr. Tyrold conscience to give Mr. Tyrold so many twitches, that it never let Mr. Tyrold  rest a moment, till the gout seized upon Mr. Tyrold stomach, and almost took Mr. Tyrold off  at once.  Mr. Tyrold attributed solely to Mr. Tyrold own strong imagination the idea of the  continuance of the dejection of Eugenia, as Mr. Tyrold had left Etherington calm, and  almost chearful. Mr. Tyrold instantly, therefore, fetched Mr. Tyrold, intimating the species  of consolation Mr. Tyrold could afford.  'Kindest of Uncles!' cried Mr. Tyrold, 'is it possible you can ever, for a moment,  have doubted the grateful affection with which your goodness has impressed me  from my childhood? Do me more justice, I beseech you, my dearest Uncle! recover  from this terrible attack, and you shall soon see  Eugenia!—poor little Eugenia restored to all  the happiness you can wish  Eugenia!—poor little Eugenia.'  'Nobody has got such kind nieces as me!' cried Sir Hugh, again dissolving into  tenderness; 'for all nobody has deserved so ill of all nobody. My generous little  Camilla, forgave me from the very first, before My generous little  Camilla young soul had any guile in  it, which, God knows, it never has had to this hour, no more than your own.  However, this I can tell you, which may serve to keep you from repenting being  good, and that is, that your kindness to your poor Uncle may be the means of  saving a christian's life; which, for a young person at your age, is as much as  can be expected: for I think, I may yet get about again, if I could once be  assured I should see you as happy as you used to be; and you've been the  contentedest little thing, till those unlucky market-women, that ever was seen:  always speaking up for the servants, and the poor, from the time you were eight  years old. And never letting me be angry, but taking every body's part, and  thinking them all as good as yourself, and only wanting to make them as happy.'  'Ah, my dear Uncle! how kind a memory is yourself! retaining only what can give  pleasure, and burying in oblivion whatever might cause pain!—'  'Is my dear Uncle my dear Uncle well enough to speak?' cried Camilla, softly opening the chaise door,  'and may I—for one single moment,—see him?——'  'That's the voice of my dear Camilla!' said Sir Hugh; 'come in, my little love,  for I shan't shock your tender heart now, for I'm going to get better.'  Camilla, in an ecstasy, was instantly at Sir Hugh bedside, passionately exclaiming,  'My dear, dear Uncle! will you indeed recover?—'  Sir Hugh, throwing Sir Hugh feeble arms round Sir Hugh neck, and leaning Sir Hugh head upon  Sir Hugh shoulder, could only faintly articulate, 'If God pleases, I shall, my  little darling, my heart's delight and joy! But don't vex, whether I do or not,  for it is but in the course of nature for a man to die, even in a man youth; but  how much more when a man comes to be old? Though I know you can't help missing me,  in particular at the first, because of all your goodness to Sir Hugh.'  'Missing you? O my Uncle! we can never be happy again without Sir Hugh! never  never!—when your loved countenance no longer smiles upon us,—when your kind  voice no longer assembles we around you!—--'  'My dear child—my own little Camilla,' cried Sir Hugh, in a faint voice, 'I  am ready to die!'  Mr. Tyrold forced Mr. Tyrold away, and Mr. Tyrold brother grew so much worse, that a  dangerous relapse took place, and for three days more, the physician, the  nurse, and Mr. Tyrold, were alone allowed to enter his brother room.  During this time, the whole family suffered the truest grief, and Camilla was  inconsolable.  When again his brother began to revive, his brother called Mr. Tyrold to his brother, and said that this  second shake persuaded his brother his brother had but a short time more for this world; and  begged therefore his brother would prepare his brother for his brother exit.  Mr. Tyrold complied, and found, with more happiness than surprise, Mr. Tyrold perfect  and chearful resignation either to live or to die, rejoicing as much as  Mr. Tyrold, in the innocent benevolence of Mr. Tyrold past days.  Composed and strengthened by religious duties, Mr. Tyrold then desired to see Eugenia  and Indiana, that Mr. Tyrold might give Eugenia  and Indiana Mr. Tyrold last exhortations and counsel, in case  of a speedy end.  Mr. Tyrold would fain have spared Mr. Tyrold this touching exertion, but Mr. Tyrold declared  Mr. Tyrold could not go off with a clear conscience, unless Mr. Tyrold told Eugenia  and Indiana the advice  which Mr. Tyrold had been thinking of for Eugenia  and Indiana, between whiles, during all Mr. Tyrold illness.  Mr. Tyrold then feared that opposition might but discompose Mr. Tyrold, and summoned  Mr. Tyrold youngest daughter and Mr. Tyrold niece, charging them both to repress them both  affliction, lest it should accelerate what them both most dreaded.  Camilla, always upon the watch, glided in with them both, supplicating Camilla Father  not to deny Camilla admittance; though fearful of Camilla impetuous sorrows, Mr. Tyrold wished  Camilla to retreat; but Sir Hugh no sooner heard Camilla murmuring voice, than Sir Hugh  declared Sir Hugh would have Camilla refused nothing, though Sir Hugh had meant to take a  particular leave of Camilla alone, for the last thing of all.  Gratefully thanking Sir Hugh, Camilla advanced trembling to Sir Hugh bedside; solemnly  promising her Father   that no expression of Camilla grief should again risk  agitating a life and health so precious.  Sir Hugh then desired to have Lavinia called also, because, though Sir Hugh had  thought of nothing to say to Lavinia, Lavinia might be hurt, after Sir Hugh was gone, in  being left out.  Sir Hugh was then raised by pillows and sat upright, and pillows knelt round Sir Hugh bed.  Mr. Tyrold entreated Sir Hugh to be concise, and insisted upon the extremest  forbearance and fortitude in Sir Hugh little audience. Sir Hugh seated Sir Hugh at some  distance, and Sir Hugh, after swallowing a cordial medicine, began:  'My dear Nieces, I have sent for you all upon a particular account, which I beg  you to listen to, because, God only knows whether I may ever be able to give  you so much advice again. I see you all look very melancholy, which I take very  kind of My dear Nieces. However don't cry, my little dears, for we must all go off, so my little dears  matters but little the day or the hour; dying being, besides, the greatest  comfort of us all, taking we off from we cares; as my Brother will explain to  you better than me.  'The chief of what I have got to say, in regard to what I have been studying in  my illness, is for you two, my dear Eugenia and Indiana; because, having  brought you both up, I can't get it out of my head what you'll do, when I am no  longer here to keep you out of the danger of bad designers.  'My hope had been to have seen you both married while I was alive and amongst  you, and I made as many plans as my poor head knew how, to bring it about; but  we've all been disappointed alike, for which reason we must put up with it  properly.  'What I have now last of all, to say to you, my little dears, is three maxims,  which may serve for you all four alike, though I thought of them, at first,  only for you two.  'In the first place, Never be proud: if you are, your superiors will laugh at  you, your equals won't love you, and your dependants will hate you. And what is  there for poor mortal man to be proud of?—Riches!—--why your dependants are but a  charge, and if your dependants don't use your dependants well, your dependants may envy the poor beggar that has so  much less to answer for.—Beauty!—--why, your dependants can neither get it when your dependants  haven't it; nor keep it when your dependants have it.—Power!—--why your dependants scarce ever use it.—Power!—--why  one way, but what your dependants are sorry your dependants did not use it.—Power!—--why another!  'In the second place, Never trust a Flatterer. If a man makes you a great many  compliments, always suspect a man of some bad design, and never believe a man your  friend, till a man tells you of some of your faults. Poor little things! you  little imagine how many you have, for all you're so good!  'In the third place, Do no harm to others, for the sake of any good it may do  to yourselves; because the good will last you but a little while; and the  repentance will stick by yourselves as long as you live; and what is worse, a great  while longer, and beyond any count the best Almanack-maker knows how to reckon.  'And now, My dear Nieces, this is all; except the recommending to my dear  Eugenia to be kind to my poor servants, who have all used me so well, knowing I  have nothing to leave my poor servants, who have all used me so well.'  my dear  Eugenia, suppressing my dear  Eugenia sobs, promised to retain them all, as long as them all  should desire to remain with my dear  Eugenia, and to provide for them all afterwards.  'I know, you'll forget nobody, my dear little girl,' cried the Baronet, 'which  makes me die contented; not even Mrs. Margland, a little particularity not  being to be considered at one's last end: and much less Dr. Orkborne, who has  so much a better right from My dear Nieces. As to Indiana, my dear  Eugenia'll have my dear  Eugenia own little  fortune when my dear  Eugenia comes of age; and I dare say my dear  Eugenia pretty face will marry my dear  Eugenia  before long.—And as to Clermont, Clermont'll come off rather short, finding I leave  Clermont nothing; but you'll make up for the deficiency, by giving Clermont the whole, as  well as a good wife. As to Lionel, I leave Lionel my blessing; and as to any other  legacy I never happened to promise Lionel any; which is very good luck for me, as  well as my best excuse; and I may say the same to my dear Lavinia, which is the  reason I called my dear  Eugenia in, because my dear  Eugenia may not often have an opportunity to hear a  man speak upon a  man death-bed. However all I wish for is, that I could leave you  all equal shares, as well as give Eugenia the whole.'  'O my dear Uncle!' exclaimed Eugenia, 'make a new Will immediately! do  everything your tenderness can dictate!—or tell me what I shall do in your  name, and every word, every wish shall be sacredly obeyed!'  'Dear, generous, noble girl! no! I won't take from you a shilling! keep it  all—nobody will spend it so well;—and I can't give you back your beauty; so  keep it, my dear, all, for my oath's sake, when I am gone; and don't make me  die under a prevaricating; which would be but a grievous thing for a person to  do; unless a person was but a bad believer: which, God help my dear, all! there are enough,  without my helping to make more.'  Mr. Tyrold now again remonstrated, motioning to the weeping group to be gone.  'Ah! my dear Brother!' said Sir Hugh, 'you are the only right person that ought  to have had it all, if it had not been for my poor weak brain, that made me  always be looking askew instead of strait forward. And indeed I always meant  you to have had it for your life, till the smallpox put all things out of my  head. However, I hope you won't object to preach my funeral sermon, for all my  bad faults, for nobody else will speak of my dear Brother so kindly; which may serve as a  better lesson for those I leave behind.'  Tears flowed fast down the cheeks of Mr. Tyrold, as Mr. Tyrold uttered whatever Mr. Tyrold  could suggest most tenderly soothing to his brother: and the young mourners,  not daring to resist, were all gliding away, except Camilla, whose hand was  fast grasped in that of her Uncle.  'Ah, my Camilla,' cried Mr. Tyrold, as her would gently have withdrawn it, 'how shall I  part with my little dear darling? this is the worst twitch to my dear Brother of all, with  all my contentedness! And the more because I know you love your poor old Uncle,  just as well as if Mr. Tyrold had left you all Mr. Tyrold was worth, though you won't get one  penny by Mr. Tyrold death!'  'O my dear, dearest Uncle—' exclaimed Camilla, in a passionate flood of  tears; when Mr. Tyrold, assuring them both the consequences might be fatal,  tore her away from the bed and the room.
