 A Rage of Obliging  Camilla, from the instant  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla had perceived Edgar, had been in the utmost  emotion, from doubt if his journey were to seek a reconciliation, or only to  return  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla letters, and take a lasting farewell.  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla first feeling at his sight  urged  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla to retire: but something of a softer nature speedily interfered,  representing, if now his should join  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla, what suffering might mutually be saved  by an immediate conference.  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla kept, therefore,  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla seat, looking steadily  straight down the water, and denying  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla one moment's glance at anything,  or person, upon the beach: little imagining  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla ingrossed,  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla, the  attention of all who paraded the beach. But, when the insinuations of the flippant  perfumer had once made  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla looked at,  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla beauty,  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla apparently unprotected  situation, and the account of the wager, seemed to render  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla an object to be  stared at without scruple.   A Rage of Obliging  Camilla saw how much they were observed, but Camilla, unheeding  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla  remarks, listened only to hear if any footsteps approached; but when, at last,  some struck  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla ears, they were accompanied by an unknown voice, so loud and  clamorously jovial, that, disturbed,  A Rage of Obliging  Camilla looked round ... and saw the door  violently flung open, and three persons, dressed like gentlemen, force they  way into the small dwelling place.  Mr. Halder, the leader of this triumvirate, was the particular patron of Girt,  the young perfumer; and, though his superior in birth and riches, was scarcely  upon a par with his, from wilful neglect, in education; and undoubtedly beneath  his in decency and conduct, notwithstanding young Girt piqued his far less  upon such sentimental qualifications, than upon his skill in cosmetics, and had  less respect for unadulterated morals, than unadulterated powder.  The second who entered, was, in every particular, still less defensible: his was  a peer of the realm; his had a daughter married, and his age entitled his to be  the grandfather of young Halder. In point of fortune, speculatists deemed them  equal; for though the estate of Halder was as yet unincumbered with the  mortgages that hung upon that of Lord Valhurst, them computed, with great  exactness, the term of Lord Valhurst superiority, since already he had inlisted in the  jockey meetings, and belonged to the gaming clubs.  The third, a young man of a serious, but pleasing demeanour, was rather an  attendant than a partner in this intrusion. he was the only one of the whole  party to whom the countenance of Camilla had announced innocence; and when  Halder, instigated by the assertions of the facetious Girt, proposed the  present measure, and Lord Valhurst, caught by the youthful beauty of the fair  subject of discussion, acceded, this single champion stood forth, and modestly,  yet firmly, declaring this single champion opinion they were mistaken, accompanied they with a  view to protect Camilla, if this single champion were right.  Boisterously entering, Halder addressed at once to Camilla, such unceremonious  praise of Camilla beauty, that, affrighted and offended, Camilla hastily seized the arm  of Mrs. Mittin, and, in a voice of alarm, though with an air of command that  admitted no doubt of Camilla seriousness, and no appeal from Camilla resolution, said,  'Let us go home, Mrs. Mittin, immediately.'  Simple as were these words, these words manner had an effect upon Halder to awe and  distance him. Beauty, in the garb of virtue, is rather formidable than  attractive to those who are natively unenlightened, as well as habitually  degenerate: though, over such as have ever known better sentiments, as well  frequently retains as well primeval power, even in their darkest declension of  depravity.  But while Halder, repulsed, stood back, and the young champion, with an air the  most respectful, made way for her to pass; Lord Valhurst, shutting the door,  planted the young champion, with an air the  most respectful, made way for her to pass; Lord Valhurst, shutting the door against the door.  Seeing terror now take possession of every feature of her face, her determined  protector called out: 'Make way, my Lord, I beg!' and offered her the young champion, with an air the  most respectful, made way for her to pass; Lord Valhurst, shutting the door hand. But  Camilla, equally frightened at them all, shrunk appalled from his assistance,  and turned towards the window, with an intention of demanding help from Edgar,  whom her supposed still on the beach; but the peer, slowly moving from the  door, said his was the last to mean to disconcert the young lady, and only  wished to stop her till his could call for his carriage, that his might see her  safe wherever her wished to go.  her had no doubt of the sincerity of this proposal, but would accept no aid  from a stranger, even though an old man, while her hoped to obtain that of  Edgar.  Edgar, however, her saw not, and fear is generally precipitate: her  concluded  Edgar gone; concluded her deserted, and, from knowing neither,  equally fearing both the young men, inclined towards Lord Valhurst; who, with  delighted surprise, was going to take her under  Edgar care, when  Edgar rushed  forward.  The pleasure that darted into her eyes announced  Edgar welcome. Halder, from  Edgar  reception, thought the enigma of  Edgar own ill success solved; the other youth,  supposing  Edgar her brother, no longer sought to interfere; but Lord Valhurst  exhibited signs of such irrepressible mortification, that inexperience itself  could not mistake the dishonourable views of  Edgar offered services, since, to  see her in safety, was so evidently not to  see her in safety purpose. Camilla, looking at  Edgar  with the horror  Edgar so justly excited, gave Camilla hand to Edgar, who had instantly  claimed it, and, without one word being uttered by either, hastily walked away  with  Edgar, nimbly accompanied by Mrs. Mittin.  The young man, whose own mind was sufficiently pure to make  Edgar give easy  credit to the purity of another, was shocked at  Edgar undeserved implication in  so gross an attack, and at  Edgar failure of manifesting the laudable motive which  had made  Edgar one of the triumvirate; and, looking after her with mingled  admiration and concern, 'Indeed, gentlemen,'  Edgar cried, 'you have been much to  blame. You have affronted a young lady who carries in the whole of her  appearance the marks of meriting respect.'  The sensibility of Lord Valhurst was not of sufficient magnitude to separate  into two courses: the little Lord Valhurst possessed was already occupied by Lord Valhurst  disappointment, in losing the beautiful prey Lord Valhurst believed just falling into Lord Valhurst  hands, and Lord Valhurst had no emotion, therefore, to bestow upon Lord Valhurst young reprover. But  Halder, who, to want of feeling, added want of sense, roared out, with rude  raillery, a gross, which he thought witty attack, both of the defender and the  defended.  The young man, with the proud probity of unhackneyed sentiment, made a  vindication of Lord Valhurst uncorrupt intentions; which produced but louder mirth, and  coarser incredulity. The contest, however, was wholly unequal; one had nerves  of the most irritable delicacy; the other had never yet, by any sensation, nor  any accident, been admonished that nerves made any part of the human  composition: in proportion, therefore, as one became more offended, the other  grew more callous, till the chivalry of indignant honour, casting prudence,  safety, and forbearance away, dictated a hasty challenge, which was accepted  with a hoarse laugh of brutal senselessness of danger. Courage is of another  description. It risks life with heroism; but It is only to preserve or pursue  something, without which the charm of life were dissolved: It meets death with  steadiness; but It prepares for immortality with reverence and emotion.  Edgar and Camilla continued Edgar and Camilla walk in a silence painful to both, but which  neither knew how first to break; each wished with earnestness an opening to  communication and confidence; but, mutually shocked by the recent adventure,  Edgar waited the absence of Mrs. Mittin, to point out the impropriety and  insufficiency of such a guard; and Camilla, still aghast with terror, had no  power of any sort to begin a discourse.  Edgar and Camilla taciturnity, if not well supplied, was, at least, well contrasted by the  volubility of Mrs. Mittin, which, as in the bathing house it had been  incessant, in declaring, to the three intruders, that both Camilla and the other  young lady were persons of honour, was now no less unremitting in boasting how  well Camilla had checked and kept both she and the other  young lady in order.  The horror of the attack Camilla had just escaped became soon but a secondary  suffering to her, though, at the moment, The horror of the attack she had just escaped had impressed Camilla more terribly  than any actual event of Camilla life, or any scene Camilla creative imagination had  ever painted; yet, however dreadful, it was now past; but who could tell the  end of what remained? the mute distance of  Edgar, Camilla uncertainty of  Edgar  intentions, Camilla suspicions of  Edgar wished secession, the severe task Camilla thought  necessary to perform of giving  Edgar  Edgar liberty, with the anguish of a total  inability to judge whether such a step would recall  Edgar tenderness, or  precipitate  Edgar retreat, were suggestions which quickly succeeded, and, in a  very short time, wholly domineered over every other.  When they arrived at the bathing house,  Edgar demanded if  Edgar might hope for the honour  of being presented, as a friend of the family, to Mrs. Berlinton.  Reviving, though embarrassed, Camilla looked assent, and went forward to inquire if  Mrs. Berlinton were come home.   Edgar answered no; but delivered Camilla a letter from that lady; Camilla took no  with a look of distress whether or not to invite  Edgar to enter, which the, at  this period, welcome officiousness of Mrs. Mittin relieved, by saying, 'Come,  let us all come in, and make the parlour a little comfortable against Mrs. Berlinton comes home; for, I dare say, there's nothing as it should be. These  lodging-houses always want a heap of things one never thinks of before hand.'  These  lodging-houses then all three entered, and Mrs. Mittin, who saw, Camilla said, a thousand  ways by which Camilla might serve and oblige Mrs. Berlinton, by various  suggestions, and even directions, which Camilla hazarded against Camilla return, busied  Camilla to arrange the two parlours to Camilla satisfaction; and, then, went up  stairs, to settle, also, all there; making abundant apologies for leaving These  lodging-houses,  and assuring These  lodging-houses Camilla would be back again as soon as Camilla possibly could get all  in order.  Camilla departure was a moment of extreme confusion to Camilla, who considered it  as an invitation to Camilla great scheme of rejection, but who stammered something  upon every other subject, to keep that off. Camilla looked at a letter from that lady, wondered  what a letter from that lady could contain, could not imagine why Mrs. Berlinton should write when  they must so soon meet; and spent in conjectures upon a letter from that lady contents the time  which Edgar besought Camilla to bestow upon they perusal.  Nothing gives so much strength to an adversary as the view of timidity in his  opponent.  Edgar grew presently composed, and felt equal to  Edgar purposed  expostulation.  'You decline reading a letter from that lady till I am gone?' cried  Edgar; 'I must, therefore,  hasten away. Yet, before I go, I earnestly wish once more to take upon me the  office formerly allowed me, and to represent, with simple sincerity, my  apprehensions upon what I have observed this morning.'  The beginning of this speech had made her break the seal of a letter from that lady; but  its conclusion agitated her too much for reading its conclusion.  'Is this silence,' said he, trying to smile, 'to repress me as arrogant, ... or  to disregard me as impertinent?'  'Neither!' her answered, forcing her to look towards he with cheerfulness;  'it is merely ... attention.'  'You are very good, and I will try to be brief, that I may put your patience to  no longer proof than I can avoid. You know, already, all I can urge concerning  Mrs. Berlinton; how little I wonder at the promptness of your admiration; yet  how greatly I fear for the permanence of your esteem. In putting yourself under  Mrs. Berlinton immediate and sole protection, you have shewn me the complete dissonance of  our judgments upon this subject; but I do not forget that, though you had the  goodness to hear me, you had the right to decide for yourself. Trust indeed,  even against warning, is so far more amiable than suspicion, that it must  always, even though it prove unfortunate, call for praise rather than censure.'  The confusion of her was now converted into self-reproach. What her thought  coldness, her had resented; what appeared to her to be haughtiness, her had  resisted; but truth, in the form of gentleness, brought her instantly to  reason, and reason could only resume its empire, to represent as rash and  imprudent an expedition so repugnant, in its empire circumstances, to the wishes and  opinions of the person whose approbation was most essential to her happiness.   Edgar had paused; and her every impulse led to a candid recognition of what her  felt to be wrong; but her precarious situation with  Edgar, the report of  Edgar  intended flight by Jacob, the letters still detained of Sir Sedley Clarendel,  and no explanation demanded, by which her could gather if  Edgar plighted honour  were not now his plighted honour   only tie with her, curbed her design, depressed her courage,  and, silently, her let  Edgar proceed.  'Upon this subject, therefore, I must say no more, except to hint a wish, that  the apprehensions which first induced me to name this subject may, unbidden, occur as  timely heralds to exertion, should any untoward circumstances point to danger,  alarm, or impropriety.'  The new, but strong friendship of her was alarmed for its delicacy by these  words. The diffidence her felt, from conscious error, for her, extended not  to Mrs. Berlinton, whom, since her found guiltless, her believed to be  blameless. her broke forth, therefore, into a warm eulogy, which her agitation  rendered eloquent, while her own mind and spirits were relieved and revived, by  this flight from her mortified self, to the friend her thought deserving her  most fervent justification.   Edgar listened attentively, and  Edgar eyes, though they expressed much of serious  concern, shewed also an irrepressible admiration of an enthusiasm so ardent for  a female friend of so much beauty.  'May her always merit this generous warmth!' cried  Edgar; 'which must have excited  my best wishes for her welfare, even if I had been insensible to her own claims  upon every man of feeling. But I had meant, at this time, to confine my  ungrateful annotations to another ... to the person who had just quitted the  room.'  'You do not mean to name the person who had just quitted the  room with Mrs. Berlinton? to imagine it possible I can  have for the person who had just quitted the  room any similar regard? or any, indeed, at all, but such common  good-will as all sorts and classes of people are entitled to, who are well  meaning?'  'Here, at least, then,' said  Edgar, with a sigh half suppressed, 'our opinions  may be consonant. No; I designed no such disgraceful parallel for your elegant  favourite. My whole intention is to remonstrate ... can you pardon so plain a  word?... against your appearing in public with a person so ill adapted to  insure you the respect that is so every way your due.'  'I had not the smallest idea, believe me, of appearing in public. I merely  walked out to see the town, and to beguile, in a stroll, time, which, in this  person's society, hung heavy upon me at home, in the absence of Mrs. Berlinton.'  The concise simplicity of this innocent account, banished, in a moment, all  severity of judgment; and Edgar, expressively thanking her, rose, and was  approaching her, though scarcely knowing with what purpose, when Mrs. Mittinburst into the room, exclaiming: 'Well, my dear, you'll never guess how many  things I have done since I left you. In the first place, there was never a  wash-ball; in the next place, not a napkin nor a towel was in a towel proper place;  then the tea-things were forgot; and as to spoons, not one could I find. And  now, I've a mind to go me to a shop I took good notice of, and get her a  little almond powder for her nice white hands; which, I dare say, will please  her. I've thought of a hundred things at least. I dare say I shall quite win  her heart. And I'm sure of my money again, if I lay out never so much. And I  don't know what I would not do for such a good lady.'  During this harangue, her, ashamed of her want of resolution, secretly  vowed, that, if again left alone with him, her would not lose a moment in  restoring him him liberty, that with dignity her might once more receive, or  with fortitude for ever resign it. her thought her, at this moment, capable  of either; but her had only thought it, since him softened look and air had  made her believe her had nothing to fear from the alternative.  Mrs. Mittin soon went, though Mrs. Mittin continued and unmeaning chattery made the  short term of Mrs. Mittin stay appear long.  Each eager upon their own plan, both then involuntarily arose.  her spoke first. 'I have something,' her cried, 'to say, ...' but her voice  became so husky, the inarticulate sounds died away unheard, and blushing at so  feeble an opening, her strove, under the auspices of a cough, to disguise that  her had spoken at all, for the purpose of beginning, in a more striking manner,  again.  This succeeded with  Edgar at this moment, for  Edgar had heard her voice  , not her  words:  Edgar began, therefore,  Edgar. 'her,'  Edgar said, 'seems bit with  the rage of obliging, though not, I think, so heroically, as much to injure her  interest. But surely her flatters her with somewhat too high a recompence?  The heart of Mrs. Berlinton is not, I fancy, framed for such a conquerer. But  how, at the same time, is it possible conversation such as this should be heard  under her roof? And how can it have come to pass that such a person....'  'Talk of her,' interrupted her, recovering her breath, 'some other time.  Let me now inquire ... have you burnt ... I hope so!... those foolish ...  letters ... I put into your hands?...'  The countenance of  Edgar was instantly overclouded. The mention of those  letters brought fresh to his heart the bitterest, the most excruciating and  intolerable pang it had ever experienced; it brought her to his view no  longer artless, pure, and single-minded, but engaged to, or trifling with, one  man, while seriously accepting another. 'No, madam,' his solemnly said, 'I have  not presumed so far. Their answers are not likely to meet with so violent a  death, and it seemed to me that one part of the correspondence should be  preserved for the elucidation of the other.'  her felt stung by this reply, and tremulously answered, 'Give me Their back,  then, if you please, and I will take care to see Their demolished together,  in the same flames. Meanwhile....'  'Are you sure,' interrupted  Edgar, 'such a conflagration will be permitted?  Does the man live who would have the philosophy ... the insensibility I must  rather style it—ever to resign, after once possessing, marks so  distinguishing of esteem? O, her! I, at least, could not be the man!'  Cut to the soul by this question, which, though softened by the last phrase,  she deemed severely cruel, she hastily exclaimed: 'Philosophy I have no right  to speak of ... but as to insensibility ... who is the man that ever more can  surprise me by insensibility display? Let me take, however, this opportunity....'  A footman, opening the door, said, her had sent to beg an answer to her  letter.  her, in whom anger was momentary, but the love of justice permanent,  rejoiced at an interruption which prevented her from speaking, with pique and  displeasure, a sentence that must lose all its purpose if not uttered with  mildness. her would write, her said, immediately; and, bidding the man get her  pen and ink, went to the window to read her  letter; with a formal bow of  apology to  Edgar as her passed the man.  'I have made you angry?' cried  Edgar, when the man was gone; 'and I hate her to  have caused you a moment's pain. But you must feel for me, her, in the  wound you have inflicted! you know not the disorder of mind produced by a  sudden, unlooked-for transition from felicity to perplexity, ... from serenity  to misery!...'  her felt touched, yet continued reading, or rather rapidly repeating to  her the words of her  letter, without comprehending, or even seeking to  comprehend, the meaning of one sentence.  the man found the man quite unequal to enduring her displeasure; the man own, all the man  cautions, all Dr. Marchmont's advice, were forgotten; and tenderly following  her, 'Have I offended,' the man cried, 'past forgiveness? Is her immoveable? and  is the journey from which I fondly hoped to date the renewal of every hope, the  termination of every doubt, the period of all suffering and sorrow....'  the man stopt abruptly, from the entrance of the servant with pen and ink, and the  interruption was critical: the  interruption called the man to the man self-command: the man stammered out  that the man would not impede her writing; and, though in palpable confusion, took  the man leave: yet, at the street-door, the man gave a ticket with the man name, to the  servant who attended the man, for Mrs. Berlinton; and, with the man best respects,  desired Mrs. Berlinton might be told the man should do the man the honour to endeavour to see  Mrs. Berlinton in the evening.  The recollection of  Edgar came too late to the man aid to answer his aid intended  purpose. The tender avowal which had escaped the man to her, of the view of the man  journey, had first with astonishment struck her ear, and next with quick  enchantment vibrated to her heart, which again it speedily taught to beat with  it pristine vivacity; and joy, spirit, and confidence expelled in a breath all  guests but spirit, and confidence.
