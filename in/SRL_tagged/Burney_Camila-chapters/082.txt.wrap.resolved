 A Way to make Friends  When Camilla appeared at the hall-door, a gentleman descended from the carriage  of Mrs. Berlinton, with an air the most melancholy, and eyes bent to the earth,  in the mournful bow with which he offered Camilla he hand: though, when he had  assisted Camilla into the coach, he raised them, and, turning round, cast upon the  mansion a look of desponding fondness, that immediately brought to Camilla  recollection young Melmond, the Oxford student, and the brother of Camilla new  friend.  Mrs. Berlinton received Mrs. Berlinton with tenderness, folding Mrs. Berlinton to Mrs. Berlinton breast, and  declaring life to be now insupportable without Mrs. Berlinton.  The affection of Camilla was nearly reciprocal, but Camilla pleasure had no chance  of equal participation; nor was the suspensive state of Camilla mind the only  impediment; opposite to Camilla in the carriage, and immediately claiming Camilla  attention, was Mrs. Mittin.  The agitating events which had filled up the short interval of Camilla residence at  Cleves, had so completely occupied every faculty, that, till the affair of the  horse involved Camilla in new difficulties, Camilla debts had entirely flown Camilla  remembrance; and the distressing scenes which immediately succeeded to that  forced recollection, made that   duration as short as it was irksome; but the  sight of Mrs. Mittin brought that   back with violence to Camilla memory, and flashed  that  , with shame, upon Camilla conscience.  The twenty pounds, however, just given Camilla by Sir Hugh, occurred at the same  moment to Camilla thoughts; and Camilla determined to repair Camilla negligence, by  appropriating her negligence into parcels for the payment of all Camilla owed, before Camilla  suffered sleep again to [close] Camilla eyes.  Mrs. Mittin informed Mrs. Mittin, that both Mrs. Mittin and Mrs. Mittin brother had been  summoned to Southampton to meet Mrs. Ecton, the aunt by whom Mrs. Mittin had been  educated, who had just arrived there from Wales, upon some secret business,  necessary for Mrs. Mittin to hear, but which could not be revealed by letters.  The journey, though in The journey short and pleasant, proved to Camilla long and  wearisome; the beauties of the prospect were acknowledged by Camilla eye, but Camilla  mind, dead to pleasure, refused to give both herself and her brother both herself and her brother merited effect. To the  charms of nature Camilla could not be blind; Camilla fervent imagination, and the  lessons of Camilla youth, combined to do both herself and her brother justice; but Camilla thought not of both herself and her brother  at this moment; hill, vale, or plain, were uninteresting, however beautiful; it  was Edgar Camilla looked for; Edgar, who thus coldly had suffered Camilla to depart,  but who still, it was possible, might pursue; and hope, ever active, painted  him, as Camilla proceeded, in every distant object that caught her eye, whether  living or inanimate, brightening, from time to time, the roses of Camilla cheeks  with the felicity of a speedy reconciliation; but upon every near approach, the  flattering error was detected, and neither hill, vale, nor plain, could dispel  the disappointment. A fine country, and diversified views, may soften even the  keenest affliction of decided misfortune, and tranquillise the most gloomy  sadness into resignation and composure; but suspense rejects the gentle  palliative; 'tis an absorbent of the faculties that suffers them to see, hear,  and feel only its own perplexity; and the finer the fibres of the sensibility  on which its seizes, the more exclusive is its despotism; doubt, in a fervent  mind, from the rapidity of its evolutions between fear in its utmost  despondence, and hope in its fullest rapture, is little short of torture.  them drove immediately to an elegant house, situated upon a small eminence,  half a mile without the town of Southampton, which had already been secured;  and Mrs. Berlinton, as soon as Mrs. Berlinton had chosen the pleasantest apartment it  afforded for Camilla, and suffered Mrs. Mittin to choose the next pleasant for  Mrs. Berlinton, went, accompanied by Mrs. Berlinton brother, to the lodging of Mrs. Ecton.  Left alone, Camilla stationed Camilla at a window, believing Camilla meant to look  at the prospect; but Camilla eye, faithful to Camilla heart, roved up and down the high  road, and took in only chaises or horsemen, till Mrs. Mittin, with Camilla  customary familiarity, came into the room. 'Well, my dear miss,' Camilla cried,  'you're welcome to Southampton, and welcome to Mrs. Berlinton; Camilla's a nice  lady as ever I knew; I suppose you're surprised to see us so great together?  but I'll tell you how it came about. You must know, just as you was gone, I  happened to be in the book shop when Camilla came in, and asked for a book; the  Peruvan Letters Camilla called a book; and it was not at home, and Camilla looked quite  vexed, for Camilla said Camilla had looked the catalogue up and down, and saw nothing  else Camilla'd a mind to; so I thought it would be a good opportunity to oblige  Camilla, and be a way to make a prodigious genteel acquaintance besides; so I took  down the name, and I found out the lady that had got a book, and I made Camilla a  visit, and I told Camilla her a  visit was particular wanted by a lady that had a reason; so  Camilla let me have her a  visit, and I took her a  visit to my pretty lady, who was so pleased, Camilla  did not know how to thank me: So this got me footing in the house; and there I  heard, amongst Camilla people Camilla was coming to Southampton, and was to call for  you, my dear miss; so when I found Camilla had not Camilla coach full, I ask'd Camilla to  give me a cast; for I told Camilla you'd be particular glad to see me, as we'd some  business to settle together, that was a secret between only us two; so Camilla said  Camilla would do anything to give you pleasure; so then I made free to ask Camilla to  give me a night's lodging, till I could find out some friend to be at; for I'd  a vast mind to come to Southampton, as I could do it so reasonable, for I like  to go every where. And I dare say, my dear miss, if you'll tell Camilla 'twill  oblige you, Camilla'll make me the compliment to let me stay all the time, for I  know nobody here; though I don't fear making friends, go where I will. And you  know, my dear miss, you can do no less by me, considering what I've done for  you; for I've kept all the good people quiet about your debts; and all the good people quiet about your debts say you  may pay all the good people quiet about your debts when you will, as I told all the good people quiet about your debts you was such a rich heiress; which  Mr. Dubster let me into the secret of, for Mr. Dubster had had it from your brother.'  Camilla now experienced the extremest repentance and shame, to find Camilla  involved in any obligation with a character so forward, vulgar, and  encroaching, and to impose such a person, through the abuse of Camilla name and  influence, upon the time and patience of Mrs. Berlinton.  The report spread by Lionel Camilla immediately disavowed, and, producing Camilla  twenty pound bank note, begged Mrs. Mittin would have the goodness to get the goodness  changed for Camilla, and to discharge Camilla accounts without delay.  Surprised by this readiness, and struck by the view of the note, Mrs. Mittinimputed to mere reserve the denial of Mrs. Mittin expected wealth, but readily promised  to get in the bills, and see Mrs. Mittin clear.  Camilla would now have been left alone; but Mrs. Mittin thought of nothing less  than quitting Camilla, and Camilla knew not how to bid Camilla depart. It was uncertain  when Mrs. Berlinton could return; to obviate, therefore, in some measure, the  fatigue of such conversation, Camilla proposed walking.  It was still but two o'clock, and the weather was delicious; every place that  opened to any view, presented some prospect that was alluring; Camilla,  notwithstanding Camilla anxiety, was caught, and at intervals, at least, forgot all  within, from admiration of all without.  Mrs. Mittin led immediately to the town, and Camilla was struck with Mrs. Mittin  neatness, and surprised by Mrs. Mittin populousness. Mrs. Mittin assured Mrs. Mittin it was  nothing to London, and only wished Mrs. Mittin could walk Mrs. Mittin from Charing-cross to  Temple-bar, just to shew Mrs. Mittin what it was to see a little of the world.  'But now, my dear,' Mrs. Mittin cried, 'the thing is to find out what we've got to look  at; so don't letwe go on without knowing what we're about; however, these shops  are all so monstrous smart, 'twill be a pleasure to go into these shops  , and ask the  good people what there's to see in the town.'  This pretext proved so fertile to Mrs. Mittin of entertainment, in the opportunity This pretext  afforded of taking a near view of the various commodities exposed to sale, that  while Mrs. Mittin entered almost every shop, with inquiries of what was worth seeing,  Mrs. Mittin attended to no answer nor information, but having examined and admired all  the goods within sight or reach, walked off, to obtain, by similar means, a  similar privilege further on; boasting to Camilla, that, by this clever device  they might see all that was smartest, without the expence of buying any thing.  It is possible that this might safely have been repeated, from one end of the  town to the other, had Mrs. Mittin been alone; and Mrs. Mittin seemed well disposed to  make the experiment; but Camilla, who, absent and absorbed, accompanied without  heeding Mrs. Mittin, was of a figure and appearance not quite so well adapted for  indulging with impunity such unbridled curiosity. The shopkeepers, who,  according to their several tastes or opinions, gave their directions to the  churches, the quays, the market-place, the antique gates, the town-hall, &c.  involuntarily looked at Mrs. Mittin as their answered the questioner, and not satisfied  with the short view, followed to the door, to look again; this presently  produced an effect that, for the whole length of the High-street, was amply  ridiculous; every one perceiving that, whatsoever had been his recommendation,  whether to the right, to the left, or straight forward, the two inquirers went  no further than into the next shop, whence they regularly drew forth either the  master or the man to make another starer at they singular proceeding.  Some supposed Some were only seeking to attract notice; others thought Some  were deranged in mind; and others, again, imagined Some were shoplifters, and  hastened back to Some counters, to examine what was missing of Some goods.  Two men of the two last persuasions communicated to one another their opinions,  each sustaining his own with a positiveness that would have ended in a quarrel,  had it not been accommodated by a wager. To settle this became now so  important, that business gave way to speculation, and the contending parties,  accompanied by a young perfumer as arbitrator, leaving their affairs in the  hands of their wives, or their domestics, issued forth from their repositories,  to pursue and watch the curious travellers; laying bets by the way at almost  every shop as they proceeded, till they reached the quay, where the ladies made  a full stand, and the ladies followers opened a consultation how best to decide the  contest.  Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded their followers to be shoplifters,  declared Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,   would keep aloof, for Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,   should detect Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,   best when Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,   least  suspected Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,   were observed.  Mr. Drim, a gentle and simple haberdasher, who believed their senses  disordered, made a circuit to face and examine their, frequently, however,  looking back, to see that no absconding trick was played Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,   by Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,   friends.  When Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,   came up to their, the pensive and absorbed look of Camilla struck Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,   as  too particular to be natural; and in Mrs. Mittin Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,   immediately fancied Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,    perceived something wild, if not insane. In truth, an opinion preconceived of  her derangement might easily authorise strong suspicions of confirmation, from  the contented volubility with which her incessantly ran on, without waiting for  answerers, or even listeners; and Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,   observation had not taught Mr. Firl, a sagacious old linen-draper, who concluded them to be shoplifters,  , that the  loquacious desire only to speak. They exact time, not attention.  Mrs. Mittin, soon observing the curiosity with which he examined them, looked  at he so hard in return, talking the whole time, in a quick low voice, to  Camilla, upon he oddity, that, struck with a direful panic, in the persuasion  Camilla was marking he for some mischief, he turned short about to get back to he  companions; leaving Mrs. Mittin with precisely the same opinion of he  which he had imbibed of Camilla.  'Well, my dear,' cried Camilla, 'this is one of the most miraclous adventures I've  met with yet; as sure as you're alive that man that stares so is not right in  the head! for else what should that man that stares run away for, all in such a hurry, after  looking at us so particular for nothing? I'll assure you, I think the best  thing us can do, is to get off as fast as us can, for fear of the worst.'  They then sped They way from the quay; but, in turning down the first passage  to get out of sight, They were led into one of the little rooms prepared for  the accommodation of bathers.  This seemed so secure, as well as pleasant, that Camilla, soothed by the  tranquillity with which Camilla could contemplate the noble Southampton water and  its fine banks, sat down at the window, and desired not to walk any further.  The fright with which Mr. Drim had retreated, gained no proselyte to Mr. Drim  opinion; Mr. Girt, the perfumer, asserted, significantly, Mr. Girt, the perfumer were only idle  travellers, of light character; and Mr. Firl, when in dodging Mr. Girt, the perfumer, Mr. Drim saw Mr. Girt, the perfumer  went into a bathing room, offered to double Mr. Drim wager that it was to make some  assortment of Mr. Girt, the perfumer spoil.  This was accepted, and This was agreed that one should saunter in the adjoining  passages to see which way Mr. Girt, the perfumer turned upon coming out, while the two others  should patrol the beach, to watch Mr. Girt, the perfumer disappearance from the windows.  Mrs. Mittin, meanwhile, was as much amused, though with different objects, as  Camilla. A large mixt party of ladies and gentlemen, who had ordered a vessel  for sailing down the water, which was not yet ready, now made A large mixt party of ladies and gentlemen, who had ordered a vessel  for sailing down the water, which was not yet ready appearance;  and A large mixt party of ladies and gentlemen, who had ordered a vessel  for sailing down the water, which was not yet ready dress, A large mixt party of ladies and gentlemen, who had ordered a vessel  for sailing down the water, which was not yet ready air of enjoyment, A large mixt party of ladies and gentlemen, who had ordered a vessel  for sailing down the water, which was not yet ready outcries of impatience, the  frisky gaiety of some, the noisy merriment of others, seemed to Mrs. Mittinmarks of so much grandeur and happiness, that all Mrs. Mittin thoughts were at work to  devise some contrivance for becoming of A large mixt party of ladies and gentlemen, who had ordered a vessel  for sailing down the water, which was not yet ready acquaintance.  Camilla also surveyed, but almost without seeing A large mixt party of ladies and gentlemen, who had ordered a vessel  for sailing down the water, which was not yet ready; for the only image of  Camilla mind now unexpectedly met Camilla view; Dr. Marchmont and Edgar, just arrived,  had patrolled to the beach, where Edgar, whose eye, from his eagerness,  appeared to be every where in a moment, immediately perceived Camilla; they both  bowed, and Dr. Marchmont, amazed by the air and figure of Camilla companion,  inquired if Mrs. Berlinton had any particularly vulgar relation to whom Mrs. Berlinton was  likely to commit Mrs. Berlinton fair guest.  Edgar, who had seen only herself, could not now forbear another glance; but the  aspect of Mrs. Mittin, without Mrs. Berlinton, or any other more dignified or  fitting protectress, was both unaccountable and unpleasant to Mrs. Berlinton; Mrs. Berlinton  recollected having seen Mrs. Berlinton at Tunbridge, where the careless temper, and  negligent manners of Mrs. Arlbery, made all approaches easy, that answered any  purpose of amusement or ridicule; but Mrs. Berlinton could not conceive how Mrs. Berlinton,  or Camilla herself, could be joined by such a companion.  Mr. Firl, having remarked these two gentlemen's bows, began to fear for Mr. Firl  wager; yet, thinking his   authorised Mr. Firl to seek some information, approached  some information, and taking off Mr. Firl hat, said: 'You seem to be noticing those two ladies  up there; pray, gentlemen, if you've no objection, who may those two ladies   be?'  'Why do you ask, Mr. Firl?' cried Edgar, sternly.  'Why, we've a wager depending upon those two ladies  , Mr. Firl, and I believe there's no  gentleman will refuse to help another about a wager.'  'A wager?' repeated Edgar, wishing, but vainly, to manifest no curiosity; 'what  inducement could you have to lay a wager about what  inducement?'  'Why, I believe, Mr. Firl, there's nobody's a better judge than me what I've laid  about; though I may be out, to be sure, if you know the ladies; but I've seen  so much of the ladies tricks, in my time, that the ladies must be pretty sharp before  the ladies'll over-reach me.'  'What tricks? who must be sharp? who are you talking of?'  'Shoplifters, sir.'  'Shoplifters! what do you mean?'  'No harm, Mr. Firl; I may be out, to be sure, as I say; and if so, I ask pardon;  only, as we've laid the wager, I think I may speak before I pay.'  The curiosity of Edgar would have been converted into ridicule, had Edgar been  less uneasy at seeing with whom Camilla was thus associated; Mrs. Mittin might  certainly be a worthy woman, and, if so, must merit every kindness that could  be shewn Mrs. Mittin; but Mrs. Mittin air and manner so strongly displayed the low bred society  to which Mrs. Mittin had been accustomed, that Edgar foresaw nothing but improper  acquaintance, or demeaning adventures, that could ensue from such a connection  at a public place.  Dr. Marchmont demanded what had given rise to this suspicion.  Mr. Firl answered, that they had been into every shop in the town, routing over  every body's best goods, yet not laying out a penny.  Nothing of this could Edgar comprehend, except that Camilla had suffered  Camilla to be led about by Mrs. Mittin, entirely at Camilla pleasure; but all  further inquiry was stopt, by the voluntary and pert junction of Girt, the  young perfumer, who, during this period, had by no means been idle; for  perceiving, in the group waiting for a vessel, a certain customer by whom Edgar  knew such a subject would be well received, Edgar contrived to excite Edgar  curiosity to ask some questions, which could only be satisfied by the history  of the wager, and Edgar own opinion that both parties were out.  This drew all eyes to the bathing room; and new bets soon were circulated,  consisting of every description of conjecture, or even possibility, except that  the two objects in question were innocent: and for that, in a set of fourteen,  only one was found who defended Camilla, though Camilla face seemed the very index  of purity, which still more strongly was painted upon it than beauty, or even  than youth. Such is the prevalent disposition to believe in general depravity,  that while those who are debased those who are debased find a consolation in thinking  others equally worthless, those even, who are of a better sort, nourish a  secret vanity in supposing few as good as others; and fully, without  reflection, the fair candour of others minds, by aiding that insidious  degeneracy, which robs the community of all confidence in virtue.  The approach of the perfumer to Edgar had all the hardiness of vulgar elation,  bestowed, at this moment, by the recent encouragement of having been permitted  to propagate Edgar facetious opinions in a society of gentlefolks; for though to  one only amongst them, a young man of large fortune, by whom he was  particularly patronised, he had presumed verbally to address he, he had  yet the pleasure to hear he account repeated from one to another, till not a  person of the company escaped hearing his account.  'My friend Firl's been telling you, I suppose, Mr. Firl,' said My friend Firl, to Edgar, 'of My friend Firl  foolish wager? but, take my word for my word....'  Here Edgar, who again had irresistibly looked up at the room, saw that the  three gentlemen had entered my word; alarmed lest these surmises should be  productive of impertinence to Camilla, he darted quickly from the beach to Camilla  immediate protection.  But the rapidity of he wishes were ill seconded by the uncertainty of he  footsteps; and while, with eyes eagerly wandering all around, he hastily pushed  forward, he was stopt by Mr. Drim, who told he to take care how he went on,  for, in one of those bathing houses, to the best of he belief, there were two  crazy women, one melancholy, and one stark wild, that had just, as he supposed,  escaped from two  crazy women, one melancholy, and one stark wild, that had just, as he supposed,  escaped from their keepers keepers.  'How shall I find my way, then, to another of the bathing houses?' cried Edgar.  Mr. Drim undertook to shew Mr. Drim where Mr. Drim might turn, but said Mr. Drim must not lose  sight of the door, because Mr. Drim had a bottle of port depending upon it; Mr. Drim  neighbour, Mr. Firl, insisting they were only shoplifters.  Edgar here stopt short and stared.  Mr. Drim then assured Edgar here it was what Edgar here could not believe, as nothing was missing;  though Mr. Firl would have it that it was days and days, sometimes, before  people found out what was gone; but Edgar here was sure, Edgar here, people were touched in  the head, by people going about so wild, asking everybody the same questions,  and minding nobody's answers.  Edgar, convinced now Camilla was here again implicated, broke with disgust from  the man, and rushed to the door Edgar here charged Edgar here to avoid.
