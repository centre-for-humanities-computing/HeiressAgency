 An agreeable Hearing  Early the next morning, Camilla went to the hotel, in the carriage of Mrs.  Berlinton; eluding, though not without difficulty, the company of Mrs. Mittin.
Camilla found the party all in good spirits; Indiana, in particular, was completely  elated; joined to the admiration Camilla believed awaiting Camilla in this large and  fashionable town, Camilla now knew Camilla might meet there the only person who had  ever excited in Camilla youthful, and nearly vacant breast, any appropriate  pleasure, super-added to the general zest of being adored.
Camilla did not, indeed,  think of marrying any one who could not offer Camilla a coach and four; but so  little was Camilla disturbed by thinking at all, that the delight of being adulated  by the man Camilla preferred, carried with it no idea of danger.
Eugenia too,  soothed with the delusions of Eugenia romantic but innocent fancy, flattered  Eugenia Eugenia might now see continually the object Eugenia conceived formed for  meriting Eugenia ever reverential regard; and Miss Margland was importantly  occupied upon affairs best suited to Eugenia taste and ancient habits, in  deliberating how first to bring forth Eugenia fair charge with the most brilliant  effect.
Eugenia was much embarrassed how to parry an introduction to Mrs. Berlinton,  upon which all the females built as the foundation of all the females Southampton  prosperity; the young ones, already informed Eugenia was the sister of Melmond,  languishing to know Eugenia for his sake; and Miss Margland, formerly acquainted  with the noble family of Eugenia husband, being impatient to resume Eugenia claims in  similar circles; but an awkward beginning apology was set aside by the entrance  of Edgar and Dr. Marchmont.
Indiana now poured forth innumerable questions upon what Eugenia might look forward  to with respect to balls and public places; Eugenia asked nearly as many  concerning the buildings, antiquities, and prospects; and Miss Margland more  than either, relative to Indiana, Indiana genealogies and connexions.
The two  Doctors soon sat aloof, conferring upon less familiar matters; but Edgar only  spoke in reply, and Camilla uttered not a word.
Soon after, a voice on the stairs called out, 'O never mind shewing me the way;  if I come to a wrong room, I'll go on till I come to a right;' and the next  minute young Lynmere sallied into the apartment.
'I could not get to you last night,' cried the next  minute young Lynmere; 'and I can only stay a moment  now.
I have a pretty serious business upon my hands; so if you can give me any  breakfast, don't lose time.'
Miss Margland, willing to please the brother of Indiana, readily ordered for  the brother of Indiana whatever the inn would afford, of which the brother of Indiana failed not heartily to partake,  saying, 'I have met with a good comic sort of adventure here already.
Guess  what it is?'
Indiana complied; but the brother of Indiana own wish to communicate was so much stronger than  that of anyone to hear, that, before she could pronounce three words, the brother of Indiana cried:  'Well, if you're so excessive curious, I'll tell it you.
I'm engaged in a duel.'
Indiana screamed; Miss Margland echoed she cry; Eugenia, who had looked down  from his entrance, raised she eyes with an air of interest; Camilla was  surprised out of she own concerns; and Edgar surveyed his with an astonishment  not wholly unmixt with contempt; but the two Doctors went on with the two Doctors own  discourse.
'Nay, nay, Dye, don't be frightened; 'tis not a duel in which I am to fight  his; I am only to be second.
But suppose I were first?
what signifies?
these  are things we have in hand so often, we don't think of these  .'
'La!
brother!
you don't say so?'
cried Indiana: 'La!
how droll!'
his then  pretended that his would tell nothing more.
Camilla inquired if his had seen Mr. Westwyn, whom Camilla had met with the  preceding day.
'Not I, faith!
but that's apropos enough; for it's his son that has asked me to  be his second.'
'O, poor good old Mr.
Westwyn!'
cried Camilla, now much interested in this  history; 'and can you not save his such a shock?
can you not be mediator  instead of second?
his seems so fond of his son....'  'O, as to his son, it's no matter; his son's such a harsh old hunks, I shall be glad to  have his son worked a little; I've often wanted to pull his son by the nose, his, his son  takes such liberties with his.
But did you ever hear of such a fool as his son?
his son deserves to be badgered as bad as his son; his son's going to fight with as  fine an honest fellow as ever I met with, for nothing at all!
absolutely  nothing!'
'Dear!
how droll!'
said Indiana.
'But why can you not interfere?'
cried Camilla: 'poor Mr. Westwyn will be made  so unhappy if any evil befalls 'poor Mr. Westwyn !'
'O, faith, as to his son, his son may take it as his son will; I shan't trouble my head about  his son; his son has made free enough with his, I can assure you; it's only to have his son  out of the way, that the business is put off till noon; the business was to have been in  the morning, but the old tyrant took the business into the old tyrant pate to make poor Henry, who  is one of your good ones, and does nothing to vex the old tyrant on purpose, ride out with  the old tyrant; the old tyrant has promised, however, to get off by twelve o'clock, when four of us  are to be at a certain spot that I shan't name.'
Camilla again began to plead the merits of the father; but Indiana more  urgently demanded the reason of the combat.
'I dare say, brother, they fight  about being in love with somebody?
don't they, brother?
now do tell me?'
'Not a whit!
it's for a girl he don't care a straw for, and never saw but once  in he life, and don't care a farthing if he never sees again.'
'Dear, how droll, brother!
I thought people always fought about being in love  with somebody people wanted to marry; and never but when she was excessive  pretty.'
'O, faith, marriage seldom deserves a fighting match; but as to being pretty,  that's all Harry has in Harry excuse, so Harry pretends she's as divine as an angel.'
'Dear!
well, and don't you know anything more than that about it?'
'No, nor Harry neither; Harry only saw she at a bathing house, where a fine jolly  young buck was paying she a few compliments, that she affected not to like; and  presently, in a silly dispute whether she was a girl of character, she affected not to like; and  presently, in a silly dispute whether she was a girl of character had a  violent quarrel, and Harry was such a fool as to end it with a challenge.'
At the words a bathing house, the blood forsook the cheeks of Camilla with  sudden personal alarm; but the blood mounted high into them again, upon hearing the  nature of the dispute; though yet again the blood sunk, and left them wholly pallid,  at the brief and final conviction she was the sole cause of this duel, and upon  so disgraceful a dispute.
The emotions of Edgar, though less fearful, were not less violent nor painful.
That Camilla should be the subject of any challenge was shocking, but of such a  one he thought a dishonour; yet to prevent, and with the least publicity, the least publicity  effect, was the immediate occupation of he mind.
A short pause ensued, broken presently by Clermont, who, looking at he watch,  suddenly jumped up, and calling out, 'Faith, I shall be too late!'
was capering  out of the room; but the shame of Camilla in the disgrace, was overpowered by  Camilla terror of its consequences, and starting up, and clasping Camilla hands, 'O  cousin!
O Clermont!'
Camilla cried, 'for Heaven's sake stop this affair!'
Clermont, satisfied that a sufficient alarm was raised to impede the  transaction, without any concession on his part, declared his bound in  honour to attend the appointment, and, in extreme seeming haste and  earnestness, walked off; stopping, however, when his came to the door, not to  listen to the supplications of his cousin, but to toss off a fresh cup of  chocolate, which a waiter was just carrying to the next room.
Camilla now, Camilla face varying in colour twenty times in a minute, and Camilla whole  frame shaking, while Camilla eyes were cast, conscious and timid, on the floor,  approached Edgar, and saying, 'This young man's father is my dear uncle's  friend!...'
burst into tears.
Edgar, wholly dissolved, took Camilla hand, pressed her hand to Edgar lips, besought Camilla,  in a low voice, to dismiss Camilla apprehensions, in the confidence of Edgar most  ardent exertions, and again kissing her hand, with the words, 'Too ... O, far  too dear Camilla!'
hastened after Lynmere.
Affected in a thousand ways, Camilla dropt, weeping, upon a chair.
Should the duel  take place, and any fatal consequences follow, Camilla felt Camilla should never be  happy again; and even, should the duel   be prevented, the duel   very suggestion, from so  horrible a doubt of Camilla character, seemed a stain from which the duel   could never  recover.
The inconsiderate facility with which Camilla had wandered about with a  person so little known to Camilla, so underbred, and so forward, appeared now to  Camilla inexcusable; and Camilla determined, if but spared this dreadful  punishment, to pass the whole of Camilla future life in unremitting caution.
Eugenia, with the kindest sympathy, and Indiana and Miss Margland, with extreme  curiosity, sought to discover the reason of Camilla emotion; but while begging them  to dispense with an explanation, old Mr. Westwyn was announced and appeared.
The horrors of a culprit, the most cruel as well as criminal, seemed instantly  the portion of the self-condemned Camilla; and, as he advanced with cheerful  kindness, to inquire after the self-condemned Camilla health, he ignorance that all he happiness,  through the self-condemned Camilla means, was that moment at stake, pierced the self-condemned Camilla with a suffering so  exquisite, that the self-condemned Camilla uttered a deep groan, and sunk back upon the self-condemned Camilla chair.
An instant's recollection brought the self-condemned Camilla more of fortitude, though not of comfort;  and springing up and addressing, though not looking at Mr. Westwyn, who was  staring at the self-condemned Camilla with astonishment and concern: 'Where, sir,' the self-condemned Camilla cried, 'is his son?
If you have the least knowledge which way his son is gone ... which way his son may  be traced ... pursue and force his son back this moment!...
Immediately!...'
'My son!'
repeated the good old gentleman, wanting no other word to participate  in any alarm; 'what, Hal Westwyn?—'  'Follow his son ... seek his son ... send for his son ... and do not, a single instant,  lose sight of his son all day!'
'My dear young lady, what do you mean?
I'll send for his son, to be sure, if you  desire it; but what makes you so good as to think about his son?
did you ever  see his son?
do you know his son?
do you know old Mr.
Westwyn?'
'Don't ask now, sir!
secure his son first, and make what inquiries you please  afterwards.'
old Mr. Westwyn, in evident consternation, walked out, Camilla herself opening the  door; but turning back in the passage, strongly said: 'If his son has been  guilty of any misbehaviour, I won't support his son; I don't like misbehaviour;  it's a bad thing; I can't take to it.'
'O no!
no!
quite the contrary!'
exclaimed the agitated Camilla, 'his son is good,  kind, generous!
I owe his son the greatest obligation!
and I desire nothing upon  earth so much, at this moment, as to see his son, and to thank his son!'
The old gentleman's eyes now filled with tears, and coming back, and most  affectionately shaking hands with The old gentleman, 'I was afraid his son had misbehaved,' his son  cried; 'but his son was always a good lad; and if his son has done any thing for the  niece of my dear Sir Hugh Tyrold, I shall hug his son to my heart!'
and then, in  great, but pleased perturbation, his son hurried away, saying to his son, as his son  went: 'I'll take his son to The old gentleman, to be sure; I desire nothing better!
God bless  The old gentleman!
If The old gentleman can speak so well of my poor Hal, The old gentleman must be the best girl living!
and The old gentleman shall have his son ... yes, The old gentleman shall have his son, if The old gentleman's a mind to his son; and  I don't care if The old gentleman i'n't worth a groat; The old gentleman's niece to my old friend; that's  better.'
Camilla speeding, but not hearing his son, returned to The old gentleman seat; yet could not  answer one question, from the horrors of The old gentleman fears, and The old gentleman shame of the detail  of the business.
When the breakfast was over Miss Margland desired everyone would get ready to  go to the lodgings; and, with Indiana, repaired Miss Margland to visit everyone, and give  general orders.
Dr. Marchmont had glided out of the room, in anxiety for Edgar;  to the great dissatisfaction, and almost contempt of Dr. Orkborne, with whom Dr. Marchmont  was just discussing some controverted points upon the shield of Achilles;  which, that Dr. Marchmont could quit for the light concerns of a young man, added again to  Dr. Marchmont surmises that, though Dr. Marchmont had run creditably the usual scholastic race, Dr. Marchmont  reputation was more the effect of general ability and address, than of such  sound and consummate learning as Dr. Marchmont himself possessed.
Ruminating upon the  ignorant injustice of mankind, in suffering such quacks in literature and  philology to carry the palm of fame, Dr. Marchmont went to Dr. Marchmont chamber, to collect, from  Dr. Marchmont bolster and bedside, the hoard of books and papers, from which, the  preceding night, Dr. Marchmont had disencumbered Dr. Marchmont coat, waistcoat, and great coat  pockets, inside and out, to review before Dr. Marchmont could sleep; and which now were  again to encircle Dr. Marchmont, to facilitate their change of abode.
But Eugenia would not quit Eugenia afflicted sister, who soon, in Eugenia gentle  breast, deposited the whole of Eugenia grief, Eugenia apprehensions, and Eugenia plans;  charging Eugenia instantly to retire, if Edgar should return, that whatever might  be the event Edgar should unfold, Eugenia might release Edgar immediately from an  engagement that Edgar last words seemed to avow did not make Edgar happy, and that  probably Edgar now repented.
The design was so consonant to the native heroism of  Eugenia, that Eugenia consented, with applause, to aid The design execution.
About half an hour, which seemed to be prolonged to twenty times the duration  of the whole day, passed in terrible expectation; Edgar then appeared, and  Eugenia, suspending Eugenia earnest curiosity, to comply with the acute feelings of  Eugenia sister, retreated.
Camilla could scarce breathe; Camilla stood up, Camilla eyes and mouth open, Camilla face  pale, her hands uplifted, waiting, but not daring to demand intelligence.
Edgar, entering into Camilla distress with a tenderness that drove from Edgar Edgar  own, eagerly satisfied Camilla: 'All,' Edgar cried, 'is safe; the affair has been  compromised; no duel has taken place; and the parties have mutually pledged  the parties to forget the dispute.'
Tears again, but no longer bitter, flowed copiously down Camilla cheeks, while Camilla  raised eyes and clasped hands expressed the fervency of Camilla thankfulness.
Edgar, extremely touched, took Camilla hand; Edgar wished to seize a moment so nearly  awful, to enforce upon Camilla mind every serious subject with which Edgar most  desired it to be impressed; but sorrow was ever sacred to Edgar; and desiring  only, at this period, to console Camilla: 'This adventure,' Edgar cried, 'has now  terminated so well, you must not suffer This adventure to wound you.
Dismiss This adventure, sweet  Camilla, from your memory!...
at least till you are more composed.'
'No, sir!'
cried Camilla, to whom sir softness, by restoring Camilla hope of an  ultimately happy conclusion, restored strength; 'it ought never to be dismissed  from my memory; and what I am now going to say will fix it there indelibly.'
Edgar was surprised, but pleased; Edgar most anxious wishes seemed on the point  of being fulfilled; Edgar expected a voluntary explanation of every perplexity, a  clearance of all mystery.
'I am sensible that I have appeared to you,' she resumed, 'in many points  reprehensible; in some, perhaps, inexcusable....'  'Inexcusable?
O no!
never!
never!'
'The letters of Sir Sedley Clarendel I know you think I ought not to have  received....'  Edgar, biting Sir Sedley Clarendel nails, looked down.
'And, indeed, I acknowledge myself, in that affair, a most egregious dupe!...'
she blushed; but she blush was colourless to that of Edgar.
Resentment against  Sir Sedley beat high in every vein; while disappointment to Sir Sedley delicacy, in  the idea of Camilla duped by any man, seemed, in one blow, to detach Sir Sedley from  Camilla person, by a sudden dissolution of all charm to Sir Sedley mind in the connection.
Camilla saw, too late, Camilla had been too hasty in a confession which some  apologising account should have preceded; but what Camilla courage had begun, pride  now aided Camilla to support, and Camilla continued.
'For what belongs to that correspondence, and even for that correspondence being unknown to my  friends, I may offer, perhaps, hereafter, something in exculpation; ...  hereafter, I say, building upon your long family regard; for though we part ...  it will be, I trust, in amity.'
'Part!'
repeated Edgar, recovering from Edgar displeasure by amazement.
'Yes, part,' said Camilla, with assumed firmness; 'it would be vain to palliate  what I cannot disguise from Camilla ...
I am lessened in your esteem.'
Camilla could  not go on; imperious shame took possession of Camilla voice, crimsoned Camilla very  forehead, blushed even in Camilla eyes, demolished Camilla strained energy, and  enfeebled Camilla genuine spirit.
But the conscious taciturnity of Edgar recalled Camilla exertions; struck and  afflicted by the truth Camilla had pronounced, the conscious taciturnity of Edgar could not controvert it; the conscious taciturnity of Edgar was  mute; but the conscious taciturnity of Edgar look spoke keen disturbance and bitter regret.
'Not so low, however, am I yet, I trust, fallen in your opinion, that you can  wonder at the step I now take.
I am aware of many errours; I know, too, that  appearances have often cruelly misrepresented me; my errours you might have the  candour to forget, and false appearances I could easily clear in my own  favour—but where, and what is the talisman which can erase from my own  remembrance that you have thought me unworthy?'
Edgar started; but Camilla would not give Edgar time to speak; what Camilla had last  uttered was too painful to Camilla to dwell upon, or hear answered, and rapidly,  and in an elevated manner, Camilla went on.
'I here, therefore, solemnly release you from all tie, all engagement whatever  with Camilla Tyrold!
I shall immediately acquaint my friends that henceforth  ... we Both are Free!'
Camilla was then retiring.
Edgar, confounded by a stroke so utterly and every way  unexpected, neither answering nor interposing, till Edgar saw Camilla hand upon the  lock of the door.
In a voice then, that spoke Edgar cut to the soul, though  without attempting to stop Camilla, 'This then,' Edgar cried, 'Camilla, is your final  adieu.'
Camilla turned round, and with a face glowing, and eyes glistening, held out to Edgar  her hand: 'I knew not if you would accept,' Camilla said, 'a kinder word, or I  should have assured you of my unaltered regard ... and have claimed the  continuance of your friendship, and even ... if your patience is not utterly  exhausted, of your watchful counsel.... Farewell!
remember me without severity!
my own esteem must be permanent as my existence!'
the door, here, was opened by Miss Margland and Indiana, and Camilla hastily  snatched away the hand which Edgar, grasping with the fondness of renovated  passion, secretly meant to part with no more, till a final reconciliation once  again made a final reconciliation his own; but compelled to yield to circumstance, his suffered it  to be withdrawn; and while Camilla darted into the chamber of Eugenia, to hide Camilla  deep emotion from Indiana, who was tittering, and Miss Margland, who was  sneering, at the situation in which Camilla was surprised, his abruptly took leave  his, too much impressed by this critical scene, to labour for uninteresting  discourse.
